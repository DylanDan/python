My name is Julie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Starbucks Coffee Company's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "Thank you. Mr. Shaw, you may begin your conference.", "Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.", "Thanks, Julie, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Tom Shaw, Vice President, Investor Relations at Starbucks Corporation. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2017 results, which will be led by Kevin Johnson, President and CEO; Belinda Wong, EVP and CEO, Starbucks China; Scott Maw, CFO; and Howard Schultz, Executive Chairman. Joining us for Q&A are John Culver, Group President, Global Retail; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; Adam Brotman, EVP of Global Retail Ops; Kris Engskov, EVP, President of U.S. Retail; and Tony Matta, President, Channel Development.", "This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factors \u2013 risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release and on our website at investor.starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. This conference call is being webcast, and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Johnson. Kevin?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, Tom. Welcome, everyone. Before getting into Starbucks' Q2 results, I thought I'd comment on a recent Wall Street Journal article noting that more retail stores have closed in the first quarter of calendar year 2017 than closed in all of 2016. And that more retail stores are expected to close in the U.S. this year than closed in any year during the Great Recession that began in 2008. The article illuminated once again the seismic shift in consumer behavior underway and the devastating impact that this sea change in behavior is having on many traditional brick and mortar retailers. Articles like this prompt three very important questions that I've repeatedly asked myself over the years and that I suppose many of you on today's call have asked as well.", "What are the critical, transformative components required to propel a brick and mortar retailer into the future? How do these transformative components relate to Starbucks? And what are the proof points? It is against this backdrop that I decided to open my first earnings call as Starbucks' CEO by sharing my perspective on what it's going to take for a brick and mortar retailer to survive in the future, and to explain how in the face of tremendous retail headwinds and cross currents underway, Starbucks continues to produce record financial and operating results quarter after quarter, and open a new class of over 2,000 stores around the world every year that continue to outperform both the immediate prior class and the industry overall, and deliver record AUVs and profit.", "Now, Howard understands this intuitively, our senior leadership team has been intimately engaged in the topic. As a company, we have a clear perspective on the answers. The critical transformative components required for any brick and mortar retailer to survive, let alone succeed in the future are an engaging, digital and mobile relationship with customers that is threaded into a branded, immersive, experiential retail destination.", "The attributes of the destination will vary. They may include theater, intrigue, or romance. But the common denominator will be the creation of a consumer experience that evokes human emotion and connection. I firmly believe that these are the ingredients that will determine which brick and mortar retailers thrive in the future, and which become victims of the current trend.", "The analogy from my years in the tech industry is how companies respond when a new disruptive technology, like cloud computing, for example, emerges. Those who recognize the disruption think long term and innovate for the future are the big winners. Those who don't, struggle. The retail industry is going through a period of similar profound disruption right before our eyes. These critical components are at the very core of Starbucks' business and investment strategies. To be sure, many of our investments will yield near term returns; others, longer term returns, but in all cases, they will further solidify Starbucks foundation as we build for future. Starbucks Coffee Company is playing the long game, and we are playing to win globally.", "Let me now share with you the evidence of our success in Q2 and why we are so optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2017. I'll start with four important and very encouraging headlines of today's call. U.S. comp sales accelerated through the quarter, culminating with a 4% comp in March. U.S. comps are further accelerating into April. Our newest class of retail stores continue to perform at record levels. And our business in China posted accelerating 7% comp sales growth, including 6% transaction growth.", "Accelerating comps and strong positive trends in our two largest markets sets up the narrative for FY 2017 as being the year of two halves. We're quite confident that we've turned the corner on U.S. comps, and that given the strength we are seeing in our U.S. business going into the second half and the beverage, food and digital innovation we will be rolling out over the next two quarters, that we will deliver on our mid-single digit comp target for the full year, despite the soft start in the first half. I want to be very transparent with you on our priorities, and explain how they relate to the two most important things for the future, digital relationships with customers, and branded experiential retail that are customer destinations.", "Our five priorities are focused on near term, as well as long-term growth. They include: One, continuing to accelerate comp sales and transaction growth in the U.S. Two, driving breakthroughs in food for the lunch day-part. Three, enabling long-term growth in China. Four, extending our digital flywheel assets; and five, elevating through the Starbucks Reserve brand. Each of these are powerful drivers of value creation that will once again provide us with outsized current returns while strengthening our business and positioning us to deliver sustained, profitable growth in the future.", "Let me start with an overview of our efforts to accelerate U.S. comp sales. We have several initiatives supporting this objective underway, including food and beverage innovation, strengthening and leveraging our digital and marketing capabilities, operational improvements, and improved in-store execution. You will recall that in Q1, we highlighted that 1,200 of our busiest U.S. company operated stores were experiencing 20% or more of their peak transactions coming from Mobile Order & Pay.", "The rapid adoption of Mobile Order & Pay and resulting demand increase was causing throughput challenges at peak in these stores. By the end of Q2, approximately 1,800 of our U.S. company operated stores were experiencing 20% or more of peak transactions from Mobile Order & Pay. Steps we have taken since the beginning of the calendar year to increase throughput have enabled to us to better and more efficiently handle increased demand from both Mobile Order & Pay and non-Mobile Order & Pay customers at peak. And we saw measurable progress in peak transaction throughput in Q2, as compared to Q1, in these busiest stores.", "As we enter Q3, Mobile Order & Pay continues to be a powerful driver of comp, revenue, and attach. And we are maintaining sharp focus on further increasing throughput. Our action plan includes three ways to unlock growth in all day-parts, and particularly at peak.", "Wave one actions have largely been completed and included additional training and reallocation of partner roles to Mobile Order & Pay during peak, testing of additional labor at peak in select stores, implementation of new approaches to order consolidation at the hand-off plane, and new tools and processes to support beverage and food production. These actions alone enabled quantifiable increases in both March and April, and improved the customer experience as evidenced by recent customer service scores.", "Wave two actions are now underway and involve the introduction of a new Digital Order Manager, or DOM. And the selective addition of labor in our busiest stores at peak based on the results of the wave one test. The DOM shows up as a tablet-based device that provides baristas with visibility on all incoming orders and enables better tracking and real-time order production management.", "It also enables a digital notification to a customer's mobile app when their order is ready, improving many dimensions of the customer experience, both in the app and in the store, while reducing congestion at the hand-off plane. We will be deploying DOM technology to our highest volume stores this quarter. But the DOM does more. As we deployed this high value, low cost technology across our store portfolio, we will create an extremely valuable source of new data insight around operations and customer experience. Data that will enable us to further optimize store operations, increase throughput, and elevate our customer experience.", "Wave three actions are being integrated into our existing store development and renovation approach. We are sharpening our focus on the selection and addition of in-store equipment and pursuing improvements in overall store layout and design, all with the goal of delivering a great customer experience and further increasing throughput. The actions we have taken to improve throughput are contributing to the acceleration we are seeing in sequential monthly U.S. comp sales now squarely back in the mid-single digit range.", "Looking to the future, this is all about how our digital relationships with customers intersect with experiential retail in our stores. We are confident that we're well on our way to further increasing overall store capacity while delivering enhanced Starbucks experience to our customers.", "Moving on to food. At our Investor Day in December, we highlighted the importance of food to our strategic growth agenda and are focused on driving breakthroughs in food for the lunch day-part. In many ways, this is about elevating experiential retail in Starbucks by providing a new customer offering in a relevant day-part and doing it well.", "Let me put the size of the Starbucks lunch opportunity into perspective for you. You may recall that we first began delivering significant growth in our food program several years ago when we up-leveled the quality and appeal of our bakery case with particular emphasis around breakfast sandwich innovation following the acquisition of La Boulange. Our strategic focus on the bakery case and breakfast sandwiches has paid off and is contributing to sales.", "In fact, in Q2, food represented 21% of our U.S. revenue and contributed 2 points of comp. We have demonstrated that by focusing on a specific day-part, we can create new customer occasions that add to the branded experience and become long-term drivers of growth. That is precisely what we are doing by up-leveling our lunch offering with the new fresh food concept we call Mercado.", "We launched Mercado in over 100 Starbucks stores in Chicago earlier this month. And though still in the early days, we are extremely encouraged by the customer response to Mercado. So much so that we are accelerating plans to deploy Mercado to a second market over the next two quarters. We view Mercado as an opportunity to provide our customers with a fresh, healthy and delicious lunch menu that we believe has the potential to drive increased traffic and attach, and ultimately help us achieve our long-term goal of 1 points to 2 points of U.S. comp growth from food once deployed across a significant portion of the Starbucks platform.", "We are very excited about our strategy and the opportunity to enable long-term growth in China, a country we first entered 18 years ago. Our business in China has never been stronger, nor have our aspirations ever been greater. We continue to open a new store in China roughly every 15 hours, a rate of new store growth that is likely to continue for decades to come.", "Increasing customer engagement and accelerating strength in Starbucks business in China once again demonstrates the global power of the Starbucks brand. Given the strength of our China business and the size of the opportunity, I've invited Belinda Wong, CEO of Starbucks China to join us on today's call from Shanghai to share insights into how we are continuing to drive our business in this very important growth market.", "Belinda, thank you for getting up so early, and welcome.", "Belinda Wong - Starbucks China", "Thank you. Thank you, Kevin. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that partner and customer enthusiasm for the Starbucks brand and the momentum in Starbucks China business have never been greater. Comps in Q2 accelerated to 7%, driven by a 6% increase in transactions. We saw growth in all categories and day-parts. Beverage, food and digital innovation are laser-focused on operational excellence, and targeted brand investments are attracting new customers into our stores and bringing existing customers in more often.", "Last December, we launched a strategic partnership with Tencent, including offering Tencent's popular WeChat Pay as a digital payment option in all of our stores. In its first quarter, WeChat Pay has already reached a remarkable 29% of tender, and has elevated the Starbucks experience for both customers and partners through its convenience and fast transaction speed.", "Following on that success in February this year, we've launched social gifting to unprecedented customer demand, partner excitement and social media interest. In only the first seven weeks after launch, over 1.2 million gifts were sent and over half have been redeemed by recipients in our stores. Our innovative new social gifting platform, we call it Say it with Starbucks, is not only encouraging everyday simple acts of kindness and connection, it is also bringing new customers into our stores to trial and enjoy the Starbucks experience. This is a great opportunity to further build new and authentic customer connections. We're only in the very early stages of social gifting in China and the growth opportunity ahead is enormous.", "We opened five new cities in Q2 and entered Q3 with 2,628 stores across 127 cities. Once again, our newest class of stores are delivering record transactions, AUVs and profits. We're also creating new Starbucks locations beyond our retail stores. In Q1, we launched Bottled Frappuccino, a new ready-to-drink beverage tailor-made to local customer taste preferences, and it is already available through more than 30,000 points of distribution. Since launch, we've tripled our RTD business and added 5 points of market share compared to Q2 last year. And we have many exciting new CPG products in the pipeline, including a delicious tea-based Frappuccino.", "Howard experienced Starbucks' accelerating momentum in China firsthand on a milestone trip he made to Beijing two weeks ago when we also held our fifth Annual Meeting of partners and families. At the meeting, we respectfully announced a new breakthrough partner benefit, critical illness insurance to parents of our partners, a benefit that is giving great joy to our partners and over 10,000 of their parents. I am so proud that we're setting a new precedent in China by helping our partners better take care of their aging parents. Our partners are our family, and it is important for us to also take care of our extended family. This is deeply rooted in our Chinese culture and values. We will continue to invest in our people and are committed to remaining one of the most admired brands and an employer of choice in China.", "Starbucks is building a different kind of company in China, a truly one-of-a-kind company, and we're doing it one cup at a time. And with the opening of our Shanghai Roastery in December, we will further elevate the brand and introduce our Shanghai customers and visitors from all across China and Asia-Pacific to an immersive ultra-premium coffee-forward experience currently available only one other place in the world \u2013 Seattle.", "We will continue to put our customers and partners at the heart of everything we do and to share our success. By doing so, we will continue to grow and to win, and to win with partners' pride in China now and in the future. Thank you.", "Now I'll pass the call back to Kevin. Kevin?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, Belinda. As you can see, extending the digital flywheel is a powerful asset that is driving deep customer engagement and growth around the world. And we are very pleased with the results our digital flywheel made to our business in Q2. This is one of the two critical transformative elements for brick-and-mortar retailers of the future. A year ago, we made the strategic decision to transform our rewards program from a frequency-based to a spend-based program. Following this transition, we have seen solid growth in customer membership.", "We entered Q3 with 13.3 million active Starbucks Reward members in the U.S., up 11% year-on-year, and with 36% of total tender coming from Starbucks Rewards members. If you include sales from unregistered gift cards, a meaningful 44% of all transactions in the quarter were prepaid on our proprietary Starbucks payment platform.", "The program change positioned us well for investments in the next wave of priorities. One to one personalization, the ability for customers to earn stars outside of Starbucks stores, and additional social gifting partnerships around the world modeled after our phenomenally successful partnership with Tencent. The personalized Star Dashes and suggested selling are examples of how we are using personalization to provide a relevant customer experience and to increase engagement.", "Starbucks rewards spend per member accelerated through the quarter as both average transaction frequency and average ticket size grew for active members. This past quarter, we saw 8% growth, the highest growth rate in average spend per active rewards member over a prior year ever, reflecting both increased ticket and transaction frequency. We have line of sight to additional digital features that will drive sales growth in the quarters and years ahead, and you will see us continue to invest to extend our digit reach to more customers in new ways that are accretive to the Starbucks brand experience and that leverage our over 26,000 stores around the world.", "Finally, we are investing to elevate both our brand and our customer experience around coffee through our roasteries and the Starbucks Reserve brand. Starbucks Reserve is at the center of our innovation strategy around branded, experiential retail customer destinations. Complementing our first roastery in Seattle are additional roasteries now under construction in Shanghai, New York, Milan, and Tokyo. And a sixth in Chicago, announced only yesterday, will be underway soon.", "We continue to extend and solidify our global leadership around all things coffee. Our investment in roasteries and Reserve stores not only enable a world-class, ultra-premium, coffee-forward experience in flagship locations around the globe, it also establishes a core innovation center second to none that will feed innovation throughout our global fleet of Starbucks stores.", "As I said earlier, the retail industry is going through a period of disruption right before our eyes. We believe in the two transformative elements that will continue to propel Starbucks into the future, and we are allocating resources thoughtfully. As our second half U.S. comps and revenue growth accelerate, there are two priorities that will require modest increase in investment. First, we continue to see a rapid and significant return on investment by accelerating features of our digital flywheel.", "We have a strong roadmap of features to drive top-line growth, and accelerating those features will require incremental investment in second half. These are the right investments for our business and they will provide outsized returns. Second, we are investing against our long-term strategy to elevate the Starbucks brand through the design, construction, and introduction of five additional iconic ultra-premium Roasteries.", "As Belinda noted, our second Roastery in Shanghai will be opening later this year complimented by Starbucks Reserve stores around the world and the introduction of food inside Roasteries and Reserve stores through our partnership with Italian artisanal baker, Princi. Each of these is a smart, strategic investment that will pay dividends long into the future. (24:57)", "Finally, while the Teavana brand continues to be highly accretive to our tea business in Starbucks stores and is now being further leveraged with the introduction of Teavana branded ready-to-drink tea sold into CPG channels, many of our mall-based Teavana stores are continuing to have a negative impact on our overall result. We have launched a review process and intend to take clear action to improve the performance of our Teavana mall store portfolio.", "When you put all of this together, we remain focused on the critical transformative elements that will propel Starbucks into the future while maintaining a sharp focus on near-term value creation for our shareholders. These priorities are linked directly to the strategy we presented at the December Investor Day, and I believe will prove to be drivers of meaningful increases in shareholder value, both near and long term.", "Following Scott's comments on the financials, I've asked Howard to share a few thoughts before we transition to Q&A. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Scott?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. As Kevin shared, Starbucks once again posted record quarterly revenues, operating income and EPS in Q2. Our business accelerated through the quarter and with the momentum we are seeing and the beverage, food and digital innovation we will be introducing, we are confident in the further acceleration through the second half of the year. Now at the midpoint of our fiscal year, we are better able to assess how our year-to-date performance, our investment plans, and overall macro factors will impact our full year expectations.", "Before getting into our fiscal 2017 outlook, I'd like to provide color on our second quarter performance. Consolidated revenues in the second quarter grew 6% to $5.3 billion. The largest contributor to revenue growth came from the 2,240 net new stores we opened over the past 12 months followed by 3% global comp growth, comprised of a 4% increase in average ticket and a 1% decline in traffic that after a 1% adjustment for transaction splitting, nets to flat traffic.", "Consolidated operating income in Q2 increased 8% year-over-year to $935 million, despite two points of impact resulting from recording certain prior period revenue adjustments in our channel development segment and one point of negative impact from foreign currency translation. Consolidated operating margin totaled 17.7% in Q2 on a GAAP basis and 17.9% on a non-GAAP basis, up 30 basis points year-over-year.", "Margin improvement in Q2 was driven primarily by sales leverage, partially offset by higher partner investments in the Americas. Both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS in Q2 grew 15% over prior year to $0.45 per share. Both measures are inclusive of a favorable $40 million impact in other income related to a gain on the sale of our investment in Square, Inc., our previous payment processor. Noteworthy is that the below the line gain on Square was largely offset by the $21 million impact of certain out-of-period accounting adjustments in channel development, as well as asset impairments related to our Teavana mall stores. I will discuss both of these items further in a few minutes.", "I'll now take you through our Q2 operating performance by segment. America's revenue in Q2 grew 8% year-over-year to $3.7 billion, driven primarily by 952 net new store openings over the past 12 months and 3% comp growth. America's delivered strong operating income of $826 million in Q2. Operating margin declined 130 basis points in the quarter to 22.2%, primarily due to increased investments in our U.S. store partners and higher cost of goods sold resulting from very strong food sales partially offset by sales leverage. Expanding a bit on food, we saw two points of comp from food in Q2, the most in four quarters driven entirely by attach. In fact, food attach in Q2 was the highest since we rolled out La Boulange three years ago. We saw continued momentum in our morning bakery and breakfast sandwich platforms, and strong positive customer response to our recently introduced Sous Vide egg bites.", "There were several contributors to the additional one point of Americas comp in Q2, the largest being continued success of our iced beverage platform with double digit growth across each of our espresso, coffee, Teavana tea, and Starbucks refreshers. And we are launching Frappuccino happy hour next week, with far more operational focus compared to last year, new beverage offerings, and the significant tailwind and customer excitement provided by the incredible Instagrammable success of last week's Unicorn Frappuccino. As we moved into summer, we will be launching revamped Easter boxes with an increased focus on protein and new Teavana iced teas.", "Let's move on to China/Asia-Pacific. Our CAP segment once again delivered a very strong quarter in Q2, with revenues up 13% over prior year to $769 million, driven by incremental revenues from over 1,000 net new store openings over the past 12 months and 3% comp sales growth. In addition to the accelerating momentum and continued strong performance from China that Belinda highlighted, Japan also delivered a very solid quarter, despite the adverse timing impact of a large annual New Year promotion that benefited Q1 rather than Q2 this year.", "Adjusted for this timing, CAP comps would have been a positive 4%. We're very pleased with our new store performance in CAP, and are seeing accelerating sales of Teavana branded teas in Starbucks stores across the region. Teavana is now available in all CAP markets with both Japan and China recording an over 40% increase in tea sales. Noteworthy is that we are creating momentum in our food program in Japan, aided by the success of recently launched pudding products and scones.", "Elsewhere in CAP, our licensed joint venture markets including East China and South Korea continue to make meaningful contributions to CAP's strong performance in Q2 as evidenced by a 35% increase in income from joint ventures. CAP's operating income on a GAAP basis grew a strong 36% over prior year to $176 million, with 380 basis points of margin expansion to 22.9%, the segment's highest Q2 margin since we made the Japan acquisition three years ago. On a non-GAAP basis, CAP's operating income increased by 33% to $190 million and operating margin expanded by 370 basis points to 24.7%. Contributing to CAP's margin expansion was the transition to a value-added tax structure in China and sales leverage.", "Let's turn to EMEA. Our strategy of repositioning our EMEA portfolio to a predominantly licensed model continues to drive margin expansion in the segment to a quarterly record of 12% in Q2, a 170 basis point increase over prior year. Of EMEA's nearly 2,800 total store count at the end of Q2, 82% were licensed up from 72% in the prior year.", "Total revenue in EMEA were $232 million in Q2, a 14% decline versus prior year. However, when normalized for the 20% impact of the transfer of our Germany business to a licensed partner, other portfolio shifts and foreign exchange, EMEA revenue grew 6%, driven by incremental revenues from over 300 net new stores added in the last 12 months. While reported comps in EMEA declined by 1% in Q2, overall system comps increased by 3%. Our system sales and adjusted revenue figures reflect the strength of the Starbucks brand in a region that continues to be significantly challenged and adversely impacted by economic and geopolitical uncertainty.", "Let's turn to channel development. As previously noted, we expected seasonality, particularly given the timing of the Easter holiday, to negatively impact Q2 revenue growth in our channel development segment. However, we also recorded an unfavorable revenue and operating income adjustment in Q2, primarily related to certain revenue deductions from prior quarters. This one-time adjustment impacted Q2 revenues by approximately $21 million and operating income by a similar amount, and was the principle reason behind flat segment revenue growth for the period. Excluding the adjustment, channel development revenue growth was approximately 5% and was in line with our expectations. Despite the adjustment, our domestic channel development business remains very strong and we gained approximate one point of market share in each of the K-Cup and Roast and Ground categories for the seventh consecutive quarter. We grew our K-Cup business by 4% during Q2, compared to zero growth for the K-Cup category overall, and now have an approximate 16% share of K-Cups.", "Within ready-to-drink our NACP partnership also gained share driven by our core Doubleshot and Frappuccino beverages. We began shipping Teavana ready-to-drink teas through our partnership with Anheuser-Busch InBev in February, with all four flavors already ranking in the top ten in the premium single serve ready-to-drink tea category in our active markets.", "On the international front we continue to grow our distribution of Starbucks Nespresso compatible capsules in the UK and France. Since launching the Nespresso compatible program last September, we have already shipped over 20 million units. In the UK, we have achieved 14% share and a number three market position. Channel development's operating income grew 6% in Q2 to $194 million and the segment delivered a 250 basis point improvement in operating margin to 42%.", "I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our Teavana results and in particular the mall stores which are a major component of our all other segment. We currently operate approximately 350 Teavana mall stores and as Kevin mentioned over the last several years many mall based retailers have been adversely impacted by reduced foot traffic, resulting from the accelerating shift of consumer behavior away from brick and mortar retail and changes in consumer retail activity overall. Because Starbucks is a customer destination, profitability in our Starbucks mall store has largely been unaffected. But our Teavana mall stores have not been immune with many reporting negative comps and operating losses for some time.", "Since acquisition we've invested in new store designs and improved merchandising, but the rate of the decline coming through last holiday and into Q2 is worse than we had forecast and we are expecting further declines at a number of at-risk Teavana mall stores. Since the Teavana acquisition, we have recorded impairment charges and closed mall stores from time to time, but given these recent performance challenges, we recorded a larger impairment charge in Q2 related to certain of these assets.", "This impairment charge was the primary driver of the 12% increase in the all-other segments store operating expenses. We are currently evaluating strategic options for the at-risk portion of the Teavana mall store portfolio and will update you over the coming quarters as we set our course of action. It is important to note that we do have a meaningful subset of profitable Teavana mall stores.", "As a reminder, strategic reviews are not a new practice for us, and typically result in a stronger portfolio and increased profits in the long term as most recently evidenced by significantly improved performance in our EMEA portfolio. Our Teavana branded teas and handcrafted beverages in core Starbucks stores continue to outperform, and we continue to expect the Teavana tea platform \u2013 expand the Teavana tea platform through product innovation and new product offerings all around the world.", "Globally, in Q2, Teavana sales in Starbucks stores grew by almost 10% with even stronger performance in traditional tea drinking markets like China and Japan. Also, tea has driven a point of comp in the U.S. in virtually every quarter since we launched the brand in our Starbucks stores about three years ago. That's the investment case for Teavana, and the Teavana business remains very much intact.", "Let's move on to our 2017 targets and how we expect to finish the year. First, I want to reiterate that we expect stronger revenue growth in the second half, driven by mid-single digit comps including accelerating comps in our U.S. business. Revenue growth for the full year will be 8% to 10%, excluding approximately 2 points for the extra week in 2016 and 1 point for FX. But given performance in the first two quarters of the year, we are likely to be at the lower end of that range for the full year. We expect the back half of the year to be near the upper end of this range.", "EPS guidance is revised as follows. Full-year GAAP EPS in the range of $2.06 to $2.10 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.08 to $2.12. Third quarter GAAP EPS will be in the range of $0.54 to $0.55 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.56. This implies a broader range in the fourth quarter, with GAAP EPS of $0.56 to $0.59 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 to $0.60.", "I want to take a moment to explain both the change in total annual guidance and the wider Q4 range, and there are two main factors behind the changes. First, we see the opportunity to accelerate certain investments as we move through the balance of 2017. These investments are mainly in our Roastery Reserve and Princi businesses, including the ramping of our Roastery openings and increasing our spend related to digital opportunities, including in-store digital and investments related to personalization and Starbucks Rewards. Both of these areas are critical to sustaining growth over the long term.", "We now expect investments in 2017 for partner and digital to be over $250 million, accelerating as we enter the back half of the year and higher than our previous estimates. Second, as I mentioned earlier, underperforming Teavana mall stores will have a larger impact on earnings growth than we had originally forecast. I would further underscore that both ends of this EPS guidance range should be considered in your models. While we are confident regarding the second half top-line momentum, we will continue considering investing in opportunities that we believe will better position us to fully optimize our business and drive long-term shareholder value.", "For consolidated operating margin, we still expect a slight improvement on a 52-week basis compared to fiscal 2016. As promised last quarter, we want to separately discuss our core and innovation G&A growth. As a reminder, we have set our long-term target to grow total G&A below the rate of revenue growth and core G&A at half the rate of revenue growth. I'm pleased to announce that we achieved both objectives during Q2, and are on track to achieve this for the full year.", "Specifically, G&A as reported declined by 1%, but after adjusting for certain current and prior-year anomalies of approximately 6%, total G&A grew by about 5%. Core G&A, which comprises over 80% of the total was roughly flat, whilst innovation G&A increased significantly on an absolute percentage basis. Innovation G&A is comprised mainly of product R&D, digital innovation and certain costs related to Reserve, Roastery and Princi. We remain committed to managing the core growth rate while investing for the near and long term.", "For segment operating margins in fiscal 2017, we now expect Americas operating margin to be slightly lower year-over-year, CAP operating margins to show moderate expansion despite the negative impact of FX, EMEA operating margins to approach 15% for the full year and channel development to post strong operating margin improvement, with second half gains moderating from the strong first half performance.", "Looking at commodities and FX, our coffee needs for 2017 are almost fully price locked, and we expect commodities will be slightly unfavorable in the back half of the year. We also continue to expect an increased negative net impact from foreign exchange for the year, with revenue growth expected to be negatively impacted by about 1%, and earnings per share negatively impacted by 1 point to 2 points. The impact of FX will accelerate as we move into the last half of 2017. All other targets for fiscal year 2017 will remain the same.", "We remain confident in our strategy and the areas of investments that will drive our future financial results in the second half of 2017 and beyond. Our store partners around the globe continue to go above and beyond to deliver the Starbucks experience for our customers every day. And the performance from our two major markets, in particular, U.S. and China, each reflect and justify the increased investments we will make over the near term.", "Howard?", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "Scott, thank you. Kevin, congratulations on your first call. I think you did really well. And, Belinda, coming from China in the middle of the night, I could not be more proud of you. And the story you told really came through in terms of the success and the bright future we have in China.", "My role on today's call and on all calls going forward is obviously different than in years past, with Kevin and the team leading the call. So my role today is really to be the unscripted closer to summarize what's been said, and I thought I'd do that through the lens of trying to put myself in your shoes, and that is the shoes of an investor. What did you hear today? What did I hear and what's my conclusion?", "I think there's a short-term issue and a long-term story. The short-term issue is, clearly in the first half of the year, we had compression and headwinds on comps and revenue. And as Scott and Kevin have covered, we feel very confident that we're going to see a significant change in both comps in the mid-single digits and revenue returning to historic levels in the second half of the year.", "You also heard from Belinda the success that we're enjoying in China. And unless you've seen it firsthand, you can't imagine the footprint we have in China, the opportunity we have and the growth and development of that market. And as I've said in the past and just having been there two weeks ago, there's no doubt in my mind that China is going to be bigger, stronger and more robust than any market in the world over time, including the U.S.", "Over the long term, you have to ask yourself a bigger question. And that is, given the seismic change in consumer behavior and how disruptive online shopping and mobile shopping has been to traditional bricks-and-mortar businesses and companies, who's going to survive and who's going to win? So I think there's two bifurcating questions. One in the short term, one in the long. The short-term question is, in terms of Starbucks U.S. business and comp growth, is the bloom off the rose? Is the glass half empty or half full?", "Now, I've been here almost 40 years. I've seen many cyclical changes in our core business. And I can tell you sitting here today, I have never been more confident that the comp growth that we have seen in the first half of the year, over time, beginning in the second half of the year and beyond, will be a distant memory. The pipeline for innovation, both in terms of product development, digital development, mobile development, and if you just look at what happened in the last two weeks, was something that was really probably the most stunning example of our understanding of digital and social media and Instagram, what happened with Unicorn, drove significant traffic, incrementality, awareness, brand affinity. And just stay tuned, because we have a lot more coming.", "So in the short term, the bifurcating question for you is, do you believe that U.S. comps are going to return and Starbucks' U.S. business is going to be as robust as it has been in the past? And I can tell you sitting here today, there's no doubt in my mind that the answer to that question is yes.", "Over the long term, I can tell you, as I've told you in the years past, that we anticipated and we saw very early on that there was going to be a very, very significant disruptive and almost cataclysmic change in the landscape of physical retailers. The number of store closures, consolidations, we're in the nascent stage of that. And there are going to be many, many losers. And the bifurcating question is, is Starbucks Coffee Company going to be one of the winners? What is it going to take to win? And, Kevin, I think, articulated that very clearly.", "One, every retailer that is going to win in this new environment must become an experiential destination. Your products and services for the most part cannot be available online and cannot be available on Amazon. In addition to that, what evidence do we have? Well, we're opening 2,000 stores a year. And here is another year at a time when there's so much pressure in the operating environment and we have another year, another consecutive year, of demonstrating best-of-class new performance in our U.S. stores. To me, personally, that is better evidence of the health and strength of the brand, unit economics and the relevancy of Starbucks stores in our existing comp number.", "In addition to that, you have to believe that in order to win and win big, domestically and globally in this new environment, that a company's capability and competency as a four-wall bricks and mortar retailer must be as good digitally and on mobile in all things that make the brand as relevant outside of the store and on a mobile device as it is inside the four walls of the store. We had a leadership position in our loyalty program in mobile payment, in Mobile Order & Pay, and I can tell you given what is in the pipeline in terms of the investments we're going to make over the long term and our ability to toggle back and forth between the physical and the digital world is only going to make our four wall retail business stronger in the future.", "So that the net result and the answer to these questions that I strongly believe, if I was an investor, if I was a shareholder, if I was analyzing Starbucks is, yes, we've had a tough first half of the year. We've got issues with Teavana, but that basically are diminutives when you look at the size and scale of Starbucks revenue and earnings power. We have the largest most important market in the world where we are already the leader with 2,600 stores and one opening up every day and our brand affinity second to none, and that's China. We have a national and global footprint now of over 26,000 stores, 90 million customers a week and still recognized as one of the most respected and recognized brands in the world.", "Starbucks Coffee Company is built to last. Starbucks Coffee Company is built to build a great and enduring company. And there's no question in our mind as we sit as a management team and as we address you today on the heels of a tough first half that our best days are in front of us. And for those of you who have covered the company for many, many years, who know me personally, I would not be here banging on the table and telling you how strongly I feel about the growth, development, and what we have in store in terms of the innovation of the company, both inside the four walls of our store, the building of the Reserve brand, the unbelievable experience, the roasteries, what's going to happen in all these cities.", "And one thing about the roastery that I should point out is that as strong as the roastery has been in Seattle, 20% comps, being profitable, it's not a city in which we can have the global halo that New York, Shanghai, Tokyo, Milan and Chicago will have when those roasteries open. It's a roastery that basically is catering to mostly local Seattle people and West Coast tourists. Wait till these roasteries open in these other markets. It's going to change the company.", "So net-net, those two bifurcating questions is Starbucks U.S. comps half empty or half full? Let me tell you, they're half full, not half empty. On the bifurcating question is Starbucks going to be one of those companies that is going to navigate through the unbelievable challenges that the bricks and mortar physical retailers are going to have, the question is undeniably, yes. We are going to be that company that is going to be the winner.", "So with that, that's my unscripted summary of how strongly I feel about the growth and development of the company, the leadership team, Kevin as our new CEO, and I thought again we told a great story today, especially Belinda in the middle of the night from China.", "So with that, I'll just turn it back to Kevin or the operator for Q&A.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Yes, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions, operator. Thank you, Howard.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Sara, your line is now open.", "Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you very much. Yes, Scott, I would just like to ask about the earnings algorithm going forward, just in the sense, that at the analyst Investor Day four months or five months ago, there was a reiteration of that long-term growth. This year, obviously now expectation is lower because of investments. Does that mean that if we think about it longer term, that we should sort of rethink that earnings algorithm in terms of I think the double digit revenue growth, 15% to 20% EPS growth?", "And I guess on a related question, we've seen other companies, maybe use their balance sheet more aggressively. Again is that something that you contemplate doing in terms of just, again, going forward, thinking about the puts and takes, the top line, maybe a step up in just the normalized rate of investments? And then what margin for error your balance sheet offers? Thank you.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Thanks for the question, Sara. I think, the first thing I'll say is we are still reiterating our long-term guidance of 10% on the top line and 15% to 20% on the bottom line. To your point, we understand why the question is being asked and it's being asked a lot more frequently by the street given what's happened in the last two quarters where we haven't quite gotten to the low end of our revenue guidance. But I think as you look at the back half of the year and acceleration back up to 10% revenue growth, we remain confident in that being the fuel for 15% to 20% earnings guidance.", "And I think I'd also talk about every year as we set our long-term guidance, we go through our strategic planning process in the spring and we look at all of the drivers on the top line, all the things around innovation for product and digital, all the things we can do in the middle of the P&L to drive sales leverage, and cost of goods sold savings and G&A. We've been increasingly using the balance sheet and I'll come back to that to help a bit with earnings growth as well. And we ask ourselves, can we reiterate those long-term targets? And we're at the beginning of that process.", "Again, this spring, we'll go through it with our board over the next few weeks. If in that process we decide that the long-term growth targets have to be adjusted, then we'll come to you, we'll explain it to you, and we'll talk about why we're changing things. But as we sit today, we remain confident give than acceleration that we'll see those long-term goals still come into line.", "As it relates to the balance sheet, we have over the last three years taken long-term debt up pretty significantly. I think, we had $750 million a few years ago. We're up close to $4 billion now. And as you know, buybacks have increased pretty significantly over that time as well. And we'll continue to be opportunistic on the balance sheet. I think last second quarter, we bought back over $1 billion in stock. This second quarter, it was over $600 million, it's about a $1 billion in total cash return for the quarter. So we have been selectively adding leverage .We have been taking advantage of opportunities to buy the \u2013 buy our stock back and that will continue as we move forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John, your line is now open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Thank you very much. I'd like to follow-up on the growth rate question, if I may, but dig in a little bit deeper on the Americas. Obviously, the Americas is your biggest segment. At least the calculation that we did around the analyst day, it looked like the Americas needed to grow something like low to mid-teens a year for the next five years to contribute to your overall earnings growth algorithm. And yet in the first half of the year, operating income growth was around 2% with pressure on both the cost of goods sold line and occupancy, as well as operating expenses, in other words labor.", "So this \u2013 are comps enough, I guess, to change that? I mean, when we go from a 3% comp to a mid-single digit comp. Is that enough to begin to see leverage in that line, or are there perhaps other things that can happen in your business, lapping partner investments, running a more efficient store if that makes sense. Maybe some benefits from lower commodities or lower rents especially as other retailers vacate their properties, that can maybe give some more visibility of margin expansion in the Americas segment than what is currently apparent at this point?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, I think, John, I'll start and then I'll maybe have John add to my comments. There's a couple of big drivers that are not evident in the P&L today. And the first one is top line comp growth. So the last couple quarters, we've been in that 3% comp growth rate, and that is a big impact on our ability to drive overall margin.", "I don't want to underestimate what a couple more points of comp would do for overall profit growth in the U.S. So being up in that high single digit to 10% range in total revenue growth in the U.S., that is a major driver of additional profitability. So, again, as we get into the back half of the year that should start to rectify itself.", "The second thing is the partner and digital investments we're making in the U.S. as a percentage of revenue, over the next few years that will start to decline. So we will continue to make investments but the reality is the rate of growth in those investments, the delta, if you will, that will start to come down and we'll be able to lever it as revenue growth increases. So that's not saying that wage investments are going to go down; rather they're going to go up.", "But if you look at this year, we went up $250 million for partner and digital investment, and the vast majority of that is in the U.S. That kind of impact on margin is not going to continue after we get out a couple more years. So both of those give us confidence in the growth algorithm. John, would you add anything?", "John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.", "No. I would just add, John, that also what gives us confidence is the new store performance. And you look at new stores, it contributes over 4% of our top line revenue growth in the Americas. We've consistently done that for 12 consecutive quarters and we anticipate that that's going to continue.", "So we're making these partner investments up front, to Scott's point. We feel that those partner investments are the right thing to do and also at the same time, we're starting to see traction as it relates to not only partner satisfaction and we sequentially improved turnover by two points versus Q1 and also at the same time, our customer service scores sequentially improved from Q1 to Q2 as well. So, I feel very good about the investments that we've made and that, in fact, we're seeing payback from that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. John, your line is now open.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much. You talk a lot about retail environment and that's presumably the implication it's a headwind to your sales. But competition doesn't come up much on Starbucks calls. There is more and better places to get coffee today than there ever has been. And I understand roastery and Reserve is sort of a way of targeting that, but how do you think about the role competition is now playing in your sales trajectory today versus a year ago, let's say? Is that a contributing factor in your minds? And how would you close on that?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, John, this is Kevin. I'll comment and then I'll ask Howard to comment on the view on roasteries and at the very high end. Look, we've always had competition, and typically, I look in markets where we've had a first mover advantage and we establish a presence of a number of stores and the Starbucks brand in those markets, that is a very defensible position.", "And if I look at where we're at in the United States and in China in our major markets, we are not \u2013 we not only have established a very defensible position, but we're expanding that with new store growth. In fact, let me have Matt comment a bit on thoughts on new store growth and how we're thinking about as we're building new Starbucks stores in our core brand, how that's helping us further strengthen that proposition in an environment where there is competition. There's always been competition. Matt, do you want to comment on that?", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Yes, domestically in the U.S., we have to look at this is not one market, but a collection of many markets. And as we look across geographies, we continue to see enormous headroom for store growth across the U.S. Just like we see differentials in store presence international to U.S., we see the same thing within the U.S. That means that there is a lot of opportunity for us to continue to expand in places where our strength has not been as traditionally great as it has been in certain urban and many western markets. So you're going to continue to see store growth, you know, ramp for us to grow into the future.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "And Howard, do you want to comment on the roasteries?", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "I would say a few things. First of all, there's no evidence whatsoever that any national company, even those companies that are discounting coffee significantly, with McDonald's nationally or Dunkin' Donuts in New England, what Panera is trying to do, there's no evidence whatsoever that we have, that there is anything that they are doing that is affecting us adversely. So I just want to get that off the table. The competitive issues question is just a nonevent for us.", "I want to talk about the Roastery and Reserve brand, not through the lens of competition, but what you're going to have to do to win in the future. Every retailer is going to have to create an experiential moment, and if you're in the food and beverage business, you have to go to craft. You have to go to art. The interesting thing about the Roastery is, the average ticket to Roastery is $20. The average ticket in a Starbucks store is $5. People in the Roastery are spending significantly more time there than they do in the Starbucks store.", "The day-parts in the Roastery are afternoon and evening driven, which as you know is not Starbucks strong suit. The Reserve bars that we have opened are demonstrating enough interest from the customer and customers are trading up, which has given us even more understanding about the opportunity we have to elevate the Reserve brand in existing Starbucks stores.", "And when the first Reserve store opens in Chicago, I'm not talking about the roastery now, I'm talking about the Reserve store with Princi food, we'll have another \u2013 we'll more evidence about the opportunity we feel to grow those stores in ways that'll be highly complementary and bring a halo to the brand. But the short answer is the competition across the street, or the competition nationally and even those companies that significantly are discounting their coffee is not affecting Starbucks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. David, your line is now open.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi, thanks. Your rewards and digital mix of sales is still growing nicely, 400 basis points or 500 basis points or so on a year-over-year basis. Looking at your active rewards membership, it's growing 11%. And that's maybe half the growth it was a little over a year ago. So it looks like that growth or the deceleration in your rewards member growth is correlating with your slowdown in sales. Do you think that that's an important metric? Is rewards member growth a key thing that you're looking at and targeting to reaccelerate in the future? And how are you going to do that? Thanks.", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, David. Matt Ryan here. When we look at the rewards program on the digital flywheel, we can't just focus on any one single metric. We have to look at the totality of its contribution to the business. And we're at a point right now where in the U.S., the digital flywheel has been the largest single driver of comp growth and we're very confident that's going to continue. And I think it's important to reiterate a couple of things that Kevin said.", "We have in fact seen 11% year-on-year growth in membership, but we have also seen record growth and spend per member. And when you take 13-point-some million members and you multiply it by an 8% increase year-on-year, that turns out to be one enormous number, and that's been a major contribution to our business.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "And I would just add that's the power of personalization that Matt and his team have been driving. So taking that big installed member base and driving additional transactions via personalization. that's what's driving that spend, remember. And, David, if you go back a couple of years ago when we were adding a lot of members, the incremental spend per member was flattish. It might be up 1% or 2%, but this quarter it was up 8%. And so we see an opportunity to accelerate that over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Sharon, your line is now open.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon. I guess another maybe strategy question. Given the phenomenal response of customers to Mobile Order & Pay, have you rethought that hurdle of having people preload money in order to utilize it?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Matt, do you want to take that?", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, Sharon. Matt Ryan here. It is one of the things we will be looking at as we look across the future. But I just want to remind that a theme that we reiterated at the Investor Conference, which is we continue to have a lot of people who join the program as soon as they become familiar with it, and our biggest barrier is familiarity with the program. So continuing to let that word get out there and help people understand what the program is all about is critical.", "In addition, we have an easy low-hanging fruit in front of us, which is to get people into the program once they begin the sign-up process. So you're going to continue to see a lot of improvement to the sign-on process and to the way in which we guide customers to go from where they are today, not being members, into being full members with the store value card loaded. And we see a lot of opportunity there in the short term. And we'll, of course, be looking at other options like the one you suggested, in the long term.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much. Just focusing on the comp topics for the company and I guess specifically for the U.S., it seems like that's the side of things that you guys are extremely confident on, the mid-single digit for the full-year fiscal year 2017. If we focus on just the U.S. for a moment, I mean, do the 3% comp in the fiscal second quarter we know the compare of these what looks like 300 basis points starting in this April through June quarter.", "So I'm just wondering, your confidence and then is it accelerating comps confidence beyond just the compares? Because, again, you would think that you would see that uptick just to keep the line steady. I'm just wondering what you characterize as maybe the most impactful new product or platform that you think in the back half is going to lead to a reacceleration in that two-year trend.", "And then, Scott, just to clarify. Did you say for the fiscal 2017 earnings that the range you gave was wider and that if you make incremental investments you'll come in at the lower end of the range? Or were you implying that you can make investments that might lead you below the low end of that newly revised range? Thanks.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "So I think I'll have John and Kris talk...", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Let me just frame if first and I'll hand it over to John and Kris on this. Jeffrey, let me give you three things that I think in addition to \u2013 well, number one is the sequential acceleration that we saw throughout Q2, that has continued into April.", "The second thing is as we look at this quarter, the work the team has done around the Frappuccino launch that was kicked off by the Unicorn Frappucinno and what we've done to really make sure that we've got innovation and line of sight to how we're going to execute in the stores against that. And if you recall, a year ago we had the launch of the transition of the Rewards program at the same time. So we've been laser-focused on how we execute better in store with that.", "And then certainly, beyond that, there's been a great focus that Kris has placed on our partners in the stores connecting with customers and ensuring that we're getting that uptick in customer sat, and the work that Adam Brotman has been leading to increase the throughput at peak.", "So the increase of throughput at peak, the work that Kris has done in terms of customer connection, the innovation in the Frappuccino and the focus on in-store execution all contribute to the confidence, in addition to the sequential monthly acceleration we've seen in comps.", "And so maybe I'll have Kris touch upon a bit of what he's been driving in terms of store partner connection with customers. And Adam can touch a bit maybe on the Mobile Order & Pay. Kris?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Well, Jeffrey, I think we've got a number of things that we teed up, especially coming into the next two quarters, around operations particularly. And obviously customer connection is the most important thing we do, be it through MOP or cafe customer or whoever it was. But the reason I look to Q3 as a big opportunity is a number of things. First of all, I just think we've just gotten started on MOP service improvements. And we talked about that a good deal last quarter.", "The things we put in place I know Adam will share in detail in a minute. But very, very confident that we've got huge opportunity in front of us around improving that service and making sure we get more people through the stores.", "I think secondarily, strengthen beverage and food innovation. As I look to Q3, Frappuccino Happy Hour is going to be a huge home run this year. As Kevin mentioned, we acknowledged that we underestimated the interdependence of those two things, the Frappuccino Happy Hour and the launch of the MSR, or the conversion MSR program last year. But we have got singular focus on Happy Hour this year. We've got this early spark with Unicorn out there that has really ignited, I think, interest in the product, in the platform.", "We're going to bring at least one new entirely new drink into Happy Hour this year that is going to be as good as Unicorn or better. And we've extended our hours this year on some other tactical things to really make sure that Happy Hour is set up for success.", "I look a little further out and I see some great products we're bringing in the back half of Q3 and into Q4. We've got an entirely new iced tea platform we're bringing into the stores that's going to be a winner. Cold coffee is on fire. Our core espresso platforms around cold coffee are some of our strongest growth we've seen over the last few weeks.", "And food. We've talked a lot about food today, but I think the food performance in Q2 is indicative of what we're going to see in Q3 and Q4. Everything from Sous Vide eggs to our core around breakfast sandwiches have been fantastic. We're going to bring a lot of innovation in core food over the next quarter, and I'm very confident that is going to help us lift comps significantly over the next few weeks.", "Adam, do you want to talk about MOP?", "Adam B. Brotman - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, Jeffrey. This is Adam. First of all, in general, we're in the process right now of making real improvements in throughput and capacity in general. So we've got good momentum there, specifically as it relates to Mobile Order & Pay, as Kevin mentioned in his remarks. The first wave of new operational actions we've already taken in this regard have landed well in the field.", "We're feeling really good about the results we've already seen, both in terms of improved throughput at peak, as we've mentioned, but as well as the customer experience in those stores around MOP in general for both Rewards customers and non-Rewards customers. We saw increased peak transactions in our busiest MOP stores. We saw the greatest improvement in customer experience scores for the quarter in the latest quarter in those busiest MOP stores, and that continues into April.", "And we're also really pleased with how we've been able to deploy partner labor against these throughput improvements, particularly in these busiest Mobile Order & Pay stores. It's a really important part of how I think we're getting smarter in terms of shifting or reallocating labor to the morning peak opportunities occasionally, and selectively investing in labor where it makes sense to do so and where we feel good about that.", "So net-net, we're really happy with the early momentum we have in terms of operational improvements around getting better at MOP experiences and just in general driving our business in this area.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "And I'll wrap up your question, Jeffrey. So, no, we're not indicating risk below the low end of the range. But I do want to acknowledge that if we see opportunities for investment or if the Teavana mall stores perform a little worse than we have forecast, that lower end is entirely in play.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. David, your line is now open.", "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Good afternoon. Scott, just on the guidance for this year, could you give a little bit of perspective on how much of the change was related to Teavana and how much of it was related to the investments you're making? And then I guess the second question related to that, assuming that the investments is a big part of this is why make that decision now? I mean, Starbucks has such a long history of delivering on their financial targets. I think the last time you lowered guidance was during the recession. So why now are you pulling forward investments and lowering the targets?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "On the first part of your question, the larger piece is the investments we're making, although the Teavana mall store performance versus what we thought is meaningful. And to the second part of your question, David, I take the spirit of what \u2013 how it's asked. We see a significant opportunity in areas like digital and specifically what we see with returns on investments that we make around personalization, around things around Starbucks Rewards, things that we do in the app to make things easier for our customers. Those investments have the shortest payback and the highest returns of anything we do in Starbucks including new stores.", "And so as we look at the back half of the year and we look at the fact that we're driving the majority of our comps from digital, I would argue we must make those investments because those will pay off both as we exit 2017 and as we head into 2018, and I think, it would be not the right thing to do to skip those. So the second thing I would say is on Reserve and Roastery, those have longer term implications for us as Howard talked about, So making those investments now as we build the Princi capabilities.", "A lot of these capabilities are in the early phases, building out. The commissary capability for Princi Kitchens is building out. The roasteries that we have under construction across the globe and opening our first Reserve store soon, all of those things, needs the right level of design, the right level of merchandising, and it costs money to get those things setup right. The good news is as we move into 2018 and beyond, we'll start to leverage those investments as we begin to open more and more Reserve stores, open the roasteries, and we think that's the right thing to do.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "And I think this just reinforces the fact that we're playing the long game. And in this period where this dramatic disruption is taking place in the retail industry, we are very clear that the transformative elements that we're focused on are digital, mobile relationships with our customers and branded, experiential retail. And the investments we're putting in are in those areas. It's about elevating the digital flywheel and it's about elevating the brand with the investment we're making in roasteries and Reserve stores and Princi. It's all about the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is now open.", "Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Yes, thanks. Just one quick one and then I've a bigger question. Scott, did you reiterate the mid-single digit global comp guidance for the year? I just wasn't quite clear on that. And then in terms of the personalization, I know you guys have been talking about that since kind of last fall. Can you maybe give us an update on how you think that's working and maybe what's left to do there?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "So yes, mid-single digit comps globally for the full year, and I'll turn it to Matt for the second part of the question.", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you for the question. We are very excited about personalization. And I would just reiterate what we've been saying and it remains absolutely true. We have only just begun. Right now, personalization, we did extend from email to the app about two quarters ago.", "We are seeing terrific results. It is the single biggest driver that we're seeing of the improved spend per member, and we just told you what that meant for us. So it's a big deal. We haven't done a lot of the things we dream about doing and one of the reasons why we continue to invest in technology is to be able to do those things.", "Triggered responses to events, triggered responses to external data that we can use, continuing to put personalization elsewhere throughout the app, and then eventually extending personalization to other screens beyond the app as well. These are all on the roadmap and will be coming and we believe they'll drive significant value for the company. So we're very, very optimistic and bullish on it.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Maybe just one proof point to add to what Matt said. As you know, we launched this quarter suggested selling across the platform within the app. So as you're ordering your beverage, we're able to show pictures of food and other things you've either ordered in the past, or would go well with items in your basket. And we saw this quarter the ticket on Mobile Order & Pay actually go higher than the average ticket on Starbucks Rewards orders that weren't through Mobile Order & Pay. That wasn't the case over the last year. So for the first quarter we've seen that tick above as we thought it would when we launched personalization. And that's a good sign.", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "And just to add, we have also seen acceleration through the quarter with regard to personalization. So as we entered the quarter, and as we exited, we saw personalization as one of those things we think is going to continue to drive comps up in the second half of the year.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "And we saw higher attach on food in particular.", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "That's right.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Which is the highest since we launched La Boulange three years ago. So clearly personalization is playing a role in that success.", "Operator", "The last question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is now open.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, another question on the sort of U.S. comp commentary. So stores that had those peak Mobile Order & Pay stores which were in 20% of transactions, you noted sequential improvement, but are we actually back to a point that those are positive year-over-year in traffic? And then when you're thinking about the improving into April, how much of that just relates to the disruption that we're lapping last year around Mobile Order & Pay or is that true on a two-year basis as well? Thanks.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "So, Karen, those highest volume stores were slightly negative last quarter from a transaction standpoint, and they're still slightly negative. But that \u2013 but it's improved significantly quarter to quarter.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "It was pre-adjusted. (1:19:37)", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah. So we're seeing improvement, but still a little bit of negative transaction there.", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "Can I just clarify one condition myself? I want to make sure there's clarity and common language, because I think the question was also is comp improvement based primarily on low comparisons. The answer is no, right?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "So in both March and April we still had pretty big comparisons to lap over, so we're pretty happy with the overall comp growth and particularly transaction growth in April.", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "And I think our comp \u2013 well, our comp performance for the back half is based on the level of innovation that we're bringing in from a product standpoint, performance at happy hour as well as continued expansion of the digital flywheel.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Okay.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Great. Thank you, Karen. Thank you everybody. Tom?", "Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, thanks again for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter earnings call, which we have tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 27.

This is Durga Doraisamy, Director of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2016 results, which will be led by Howard Schultz, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Johnson, President and COO; Michael Conway, President, Global Channel Development; and Scott Maw, CFO.", "Joining us for Q&A are Cliff Burrows, Group President, U.S. Americas and Teavana; John Culver, Group President, China Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; and Adam Brotman, Chief Digital Officer.", "This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.

This call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our Web site at investor.starbucks.com.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Howard.", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, Durga, and welcome to everyone on today's call.", "Starbucks stellar Q1 2016 financial and operating performance highlighted by a 9% increase in comp store sales in the U.S. and 8% increase in comp store sales globally, our third sequential quarter of 4% increase in global traffic by far the strongest holiday in our history and record revenues and record operating income from our channel development segment underscores the increasing strength and relevancy of the Starbucks brand and the success of the accretive fly wheel positive effect of retail, CPG, digital, mobile loyalty card, investment strategies around the world that are coming together to accelerate our growth and drive significant margin expansion and EPS leverage across our business.", "In Q1, Starbucks delivered a 12% increase in revenue to a record $5.4 billion and 15% increase in non-GAAP EPS to a record $0.46 per share. Despite the significant investments we continue to make in our partners and in our business. And we served over 23 million more customer occasions from our global comp store base in Q1 and roughly 18 million more customer occasions in the U.S. alone and we did in our very strong Q1 last year.", "Starbucks Coffee Company is connecting more deeply with more customers across all day parts around the world than ever before and we are delivering quarter-after-quarter of record breaking financial and operating results despite the accelerating shift in consumer behavior away from traditional bricks and mortar retailing and despite challenging macro economic foreign exchange, geopolitical and retail and consumer headwinds that continue to negatively impact many other national and global retailers.", "Global leadership around all things coffee and tea and ongoing beverage and food innovation remain at Starbucks core and are propelling our business forward. And in Q1, we brought further premiumization to the coffee category creating even greater separation from our competitors and delivered an elevated highly differentiated locally relevant premium coffee and tea beverage, food and in-store experience to our customers everywhere.", "Our Seattle roastery continues to delight both regular customers and visitors from around the world to Seattle at the same time as it performs well ahead of original expectations and serves as a launching pad for our ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve brand. Our plans to build over 500 coffee forward Starbucks Reserve stores in key global markets are well underway. Starbucks Reserve stores provide customers with a unique, highly premiumized in-store experience that showcases the finest assortment of exclusive Starbucks Reserve micro-lot single varietals and new specialized coffee brewing methods to an intimate one-on-one partner customer experience that takes place as it reached [ph] the crafts and explains the custom beverage.", "Starbucks Reserve stores also offers a curated assortment of Teavana teas to increase consumer awareness of Teavana's super-premium loose-leaf and packaged teas. Starbucks Reserve coffee varietals are now also available in several thousand high-profile Starbucks stores globally, further elevating both existing Starbucks stores and the Starbucks Reserve brand while demonstrating a global sourcing capability and diversity margin that only Starbucks can deliver.", "Starbucks' channel development segment is literally firing on all cylinders delivering meaningful share gains and record sales and profitability in Q1. The Starbucks brand now has the lead position and leave market share in both premium roasted ground and premium single-serve on the K-Cup platform. Michael Conway will take you through channel development's performance in Q1 shortly. But by creating more opportunities for more people to engage with us more often, both inside and outside of our stores, Starbucks' integrated highly coordinated retail and wholesale strategy is driving our business and our growth around the world.", "No national or global retailer has been able to leverage a retail store footprint into a CPG business remotely approaching the size, scale and profitability of ours. Under Mike's leadership, Starbucks' CPG business has become a powerful, fast-growing and highly profitable business and complementary channel of distribution for us.", "By anticipating and investing years ahead of the mobile technology curve, Starbucks today is redefining the customer-facing and partner-facing mobile and retail experiences of the future. In a few minutes, Kevin will take you through how we are leveraging proprietary technology, digital engagement and customer loyalty to create a comprehensive integrated digital and mobile ecosystem that will continue to drive our business well into the future.", "Technology innovation is further strengthening our brand, improving our efficiency and in-store execution, increasing our profitability and most importantly, enabling us to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers, particularly to Millennials.", "Starbucks' unique combination of assets includes a growing global physical footprint of now over 23,500 stores, over 300,000 passionate Starbucks partners who probably wear the green apron and who I wish to personally thank for the extraordinary results we reported today. Breakthrough mobile and digital technologies in over 190,000 points of CP distribution all over the world. Together, these attributes are contributing to the strength we are seeing in our business and enabling us to serve over 85 million customer transactions around the world every week at the same time as we continue to extend our reach and deepen our emotional connection to customers everywhere.", "But key to our business and what no other consumer brand or retailer can even approach is the deep, authentic connection we have with our customers and that our customers have with our people in the Starbucks brand. I experienced this first hand, perhaps like never before, on a trip with John Culver to Asia just last week. We began in Chengdu, China, where over 1,300 Starbucks partners and their families joined us at our Fourth Annual Partner China Family Forum.", "It was an extraordinary emotional event that celebrated the pride and the respect that the parents of our partners have for their children and in their children's connection to Starbucks, the deep emotional connection that exists among our China partners themselves and the shared commitment that all our partners in China have to deliver an extraordinary Starbucks experience to their customers. Joining us to share his respect and admiration for Starbucks at the event and to all of Starbucks partners and their families was Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba.", "In Q1, we introduced social gifting to China through Alibaba's T-Mobile site to a stunning customer response. And now and for the very first time, through Tmall, our customers in China can give their friends and colleagues digital Starbucks gifts, including My Starbucks Rewards memberships, individual beverages and preloaded Starbucks digital gift cards. We are honored that the Chinese government chose Starbucks to be the first company in China to be authorized to offer customers a stored value card.", "As you know, China has been in the news a great deal lately. As a CEO that's traveled to China repeatedly over the last ten years, perhaps more than any other American CEO, I have a unique perspective to share. First, let me say that China is here to stay. The buffening that the Chinese economy is taking during today's period of transition is necessary for it to move on its next stage of development.", "Short-term market gyrations, however, should not be confused with actions that will lead to long-term sustainable economic gain, especially as China moves to a consumer driven economy. I strongly believe that the Chinese government's commitment to true economic reform is genuine and that its goal of doubling 2010 per capita income by 2021 resulting in a middle-class in China approaching 600 million Chinese people, or almost twice the size of the entire current U.S. population, is attainable.", "We are taking a long-term view on how we will build our business in China because despite now having close to 2,000 stores in nearly 100 cities in China and being on track to have 3,400 stores on the mainland by 2019, I am convinced more than ever that Starbucks is just getting started in that important country. And I am equally convinced that, when we fully roll out our digital, mobile, card gifting and loyalty programs across our business in China and CAP overall and expand distribution of our ready-to-drink products later this fiscal year, we will perform at even higher levels than we are today.", "Following China, we went to India where our business with JV partner Tata, already 80 stores strong, is growing faster on a percentage basis than any other region in the world. And we saw firsthand the excitement consumers have for the Starbucks brand and the deep authentic connections our partners are creating with their customers. Starbucks Coffee Company has always and will continue to play the long game with strict adherence to our strategic plan for growing our business and continuing to deliver world-leading financial and operating performance and long-term sustainable, profitable growth into the future. And that growth will include continued growth of our K-Cup business.", "Over the last five years, we have invested and build a strong sustainable single-serve business operating on the current K-Cup platform and today Starbucks is the leading brand with the leading share on that platform. Since Keurig announced it was selling itself, we have fielded many questions about our intentions following the sale. I want to assure retailers, the millions of consumers who demand Starbucks branded coffees to their Keurig brewers, many of whom have told us that they actually purchased a Keurig brewer only after Starbucks coffee became available in the platform and at the market that we are in the K-Cup business to stay. However, at this moment, the only matter that remains unresolved is whether we will be doing so in conjunction with Keurig or on our own.", "Starbucks is combining unparalleled financial performance with unmatched groundbreaking innovation that is being embraced by customers and our people around the world. And we now have so much on the horizon. Never in 24 years as a public company has the Starbucks brand or business been stronger or more universally relevant and accepted than it is today and never before have the opportunities lie ahead or our aspirations ever been greater. We remain humble and steadfast in our mission to exceed the expectations of our customers and our partners to share our success with our people and the communities we serve to create positive social impact and to continue along our path of building a great enduring company.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?", "Kevin Johnson", "Thanks Howard. Good afternoon everyone.", "I'd like to build on Howard's comments and share a few observations on the quarter before asking Mike Conway to discuss the amazing performance channel development delivered in Q1. Scott Maw will then take us through the Q1 financials in detail.", "Starbucks' global comp store sales grew 8% in Q1 with 4% coming from increased traffic. This represented our 24th consecutive quarter of comp growth of 5% or greater. As Howard mentioned, we are experiencing significant transaction growth in every geographic region and that contributed to our strong Q1 performance.", "On our last earnings call, I reinforced the clarity we have around our strategic priorities, investments we are making in the business and the focus we have on operational execution. This clarity and focus is enabling every segment of our business to deliver. Retail, channel development and digital are driving the revenue and profit increases we are seeing and elevating the Starbucks brand in the mind of consumers the world over.", "This holiday season, we delivered meaningful beverage and food innovation with Holiday Spice Flat White and an expanded holiday food platform to enhance the in-store holiday experience. And we leveraged our digital assets to reward our most loyal customers with five specialized Very Monday offers throughout the holiday season. Those offers, combined with the Starbucks for Life sweepstakes, this year open only to our MSR members, drove customer traffic and increased MSR loyalty membership.", "Retail innovation and digital engagement were then complemented by great execution across all channels, where sales of our packaged Holiday Blend coffee was particularly strong, our new Christmas Blend Reserve coffee quickly sold out and our K-Cup platforms delivered record dollar share for the quarter.", "Starbucks gift cards once again enabled customers to give the gift of choice. And this year, one in six American adults received a Starbucks gift card, up from one in seven last year and one in eight the year before. And this holiday, $1.9 billion was loaded on cards in the U.S. and Canada in Q1 alone, up 19% over a year ago. Gift cards lead to increased MSR membership and the digital flywheel spins faster and with increased strength and momentum. This dynamic was reflected in the performance in each of our segments.", "Our fast-growing Americas segment had another very strong quarter, posting 9% comp growth with 4% coming from an increase in traffic. The Americas added 171 net new stores in the quarter and 573 net new stores over the past 12 months. Core offerings in our blended espresso and iced beverage platforms, including innovations such as Teavana Shaken iced teas and cold brewed coffee, delivered double-digit growth in the quarter and drove 4 points of comp in the U.S.", "Beverage innovation and the sales of Teavana branded handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks retail each contributed 1 point to the U.S. comp growth. And our morning daypart saw its strongest growth in five years. Food revenue was up nearly 20% over last year, contributing 3 points of U.S. comp sales in the quarter. Our food business is growing across all dayparts with Bistro Boxes up 65% and breakfast sandwiches up more than 40% year-over-year.", "Our newest class of stores continues to perform extremely well with first-year average volumes exceeding $1.4 million while delivering record profitability and return on investment.", "Moving onto CAP, the change in ownership of Starbucks Japan, the addition of 281 net new stores in CAP and comp growth of 5% from our existing store base drove CAP revenues up 32%. We remain very bullish on our long-term growth potential in CAP where we now operate over 5,700 stores and we remain on plan to double our CAP store count to roughly 10,000 locations by 2019. We opened the market in Cambodia, our 16th CAP market in Q1.", "One way we are continuing to extend our coffee leadership and authority around all things coffee in CAP is by expanding our successful Reserve platform where we now have over 200 stores selling Starbucks Reserve. Operating and financial performance across our CAP Reserve stores is among the highest of any stores across the entire global portfolio.", "As Howard mentioned, China, Starbucks' largest market outside the U.S., remains a very big part of our CAP story. We now operate roughly 2,000 stores on mainland China with a presence in nearly 100 cities and we are on plan to achieve our goal of having 3,400 stores by fiscal year 2019.", "As we grow our store footprint, particularly in China, it is important to note that our new class of company-operated stores in CAP is significantly outperforming even the most recent prior class, reflecting both the increasing strength of the Starbucks brand in the region and improved operating leverage, both of which contribute to the great confidence we have in the opportunity that lies ahead for us in the CAP region.", "Our business in Japan continues to be very strong. We are benefiting from solid execution against our plans to leverage the brand and our connection to customers to drive growth across all dayparts in the key Japanese market. Noteworthy is that Q1 was the first quarter in which our stores in Japan are included in our global comp base. The passion and commitment of our partners in CAP is enabling us to deliver a great customer experience that is strengthening our connection with customers and driving our business throughout the region.", "Let's move on to EMEA. Our EMEA segment delivered 1% comp growth representing its 11th consecutive quarter of positive comps. Fairly strong performance given the dramatic decline in consumer and tourist activity across many of Western Europe's largest cities following their horrific November 15 terrorist attacks in Paris. Business prior to those attacks was strong and EMEA was on track to have a solid quarter. We have quite recently begun to see the effects of that regions resilience and a recovery.", "We opened a flagship Starbucks Reserve store in London, setting the stage for significant expansion of our Starbucks Reserve platform across the EMEA region in the months and quarters ahead. EMEA continued to rebalance its store portfolio, ending the quarter with 71% of all EMEA stores now being licensed, up from 63% at the end of Q1 last year. The segment opened 79 net new stores in the quarter, all of which were licensed, including our first store in Kazakhstan, our 36th EMEA market, which opened to a tremendous customer and partner response. We look forward to opening new EMEA markets in South Africa and Luxembourg in 2016.", "In addition to strong retail performance, our channel development segment delivered record results in the quarter.", "And we've asked Michael Conway, who leads Channel Development, to share some highlights. Mike?", "Mike Conway", "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon everyone.", "Channel Development continued its strong momentum and delivered record financial and operating performance in Q1 while connecting more and more people to Starbucks Coffee around the world where they live, work and play. We experienced record revenues of $512 million and we were up 16% over Q1 last year following a 14% increase in Q4 of fiscal 2015. This was driven by strength of our U.S. CPG, ready-serve coffee and food service businesses. Our operating income grew 23% in the quarter to $193 million.", "In Q1, each of our U.S. at-home coffee segments significantly outpaced the overall category punctuated by strong in-store execution of our holiday program in the U.S. Just as our Starbucks stores turned red to signal the holidays, Starbucks also turned the aisles red with nearly two out of three grocery stores on average having a holiday display in December.", "In addition, our limited-time Holiday Blend coffee in both K-Cup and roast and ground was the fastest selling coffee in the Starbucks portfolio in the first quarter. Both the Starbucks roast and ground and Starbucks K-Cup platforms delivered record dollar share for the quarter. Already the leader in premium coffee, total Starbucks grew 16%, more than five times total category growth, moving Starbucks ahead of Kraft to become the number two player in all of coffee.", "In addition, Starbucks was the fastest-growing coffee company and the largest contributor to category growth. Starbucks K-Cups posted very strong dollar sales growth of 20% and gained 100 basis points of share to a record 17.2%, making Starbucks yet again the number one K-Cup brand for the quarter and now also the number one brand for the full calendar year while creating further share gap separation from our nearest competitor.", "Recently launched Starbucks hot cocoa K-Cups contributed to our share increase, quickly becoming the third fastest moving SKU within our K-Cup portfolio in December. Starbucks roast and ground continues to be the number one premium packaged coffee brand with dollar sales growth of 10% and share growth of 160 basis points to a record 27.3% share for the quarter. Our food service business continues to lead the industry in Q1 with 14% net revenue growth compared to an average industry growth of 2% to 3%.", "We saw strength across several channels of business, including college and university, travel and office coffee, as employers are increasingly offering Starbucks as the premium coffee of choice to their employees and their customers. Our Q1 performance was also positively impacted by revenue growth from existing partner accounts such as Delta Airlines and The Compass Group.", "Turning to ready-to-drink coffee, our North American coffee partnership with PepsiCo posted excellent results during the quarter. System sales as measured by IRI grew 22%, resulting in a 110 basis point share gain in the total liquid coffee and energy segment to 13.4%, driven by new product innovation in our Frappuccino and Double Shot platforms and through expanded distribution.", "For the full calendar year, Starbucks is now the number eight brand in the liquid refreshment beverage category and ahead of established brands such as PowerAde and Sprite.", "Beyond the U.S., we continue to successfully execute against plans to build our global ready-to-drink coffee business. Our partnership in China with Tingyi is on track for a midyear 2016 product launch. And through our newer agreement with PepsiCo Latin America, we will be building distribution in the region during the second half of 2016. We are also increasing our ready-to-drink penetration in EMEA with momentum building from our most recent launches in six Middle East markets.", "Our outlook for 2016 remains positive, supported by strong in-store programming and new product launches like Starbucks latte K-Cups for both coffee and tea. Combined with the strength of the Starbucks brands and the quality of our coffee, we will continue to delight our customers, outpace the category and build upon our leadership position in the market.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin. Kevin?", "Kevin Johnson", "Thanks Mike.", "A key element of our strategy is our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program combined with digital engagement. This was another quarter of solid progress. We continued to see broad customer acceptance and adoption of our mobile platform and the Starbucks mobile app has emerged as an evolving platform and a profit driver of its own. We increased the number of active MSR members in the U.S. to 11.1 million, up 23% over Q1 last year. We are seeing growth of active MSR customers in markets around the world. Customer engagement is also growing.", "In the quarter, over 21% of total U.S. transactions were paid using the mobile apps with December accelerating to 22%, and we are seeing further acceleration in the month of January. Over 1 million customers in the U.S. used our mobile order and pay capability in the month of December and those customers averaged approximately five mobile orders in the month, driving meaningful revenue growth and incrementality. Usage of mobile order and pay is growing and we are now processing over 6 million mobile order and pay transactions per month.", "In many of our busiest stores where morning peak demand is high, mobile order and pay exceeds 10% of total transactions. And we have just scratched the surface. We have bigger aspirations for our digital plan and we are expanding the digital agenda across four key pillars. The first is delivery. We are extending Mobile Order & Pay to include a delivery option for customers. Pilots are underway in Seattle and New York City, and we are learning many new things that will help us shape the future of delivery. Number two, personalized offerings. We have invested in technology to help us better personalize the offers we make to our loyalty customers. This will strengthen our customer connection and fuel growth.", "Number three, global deployment. We are committed to leveraging these digital experiences in our major company-operated markets and with our licensee partners. And number four, digital media. The Spotify music capability we launched this week is one example of an integrated digital media experience. We plan to explore additional digital media scenarios that are entertaining and interesting to consumers and that align with our brand. The Starbucks digital Flywheel is driven by our loyalty program and membership in My Starbucks Rewards has grown by over 50% in the last two years.", "In 2016, we will enhancing the Starbucks Rewards program and enable our loyalty customers to earn stars in many new and exciting ways. Clarity of our strategic priorities and investments combined with a focus on excellence and execution is powering our results.", "I will now hand the call over to Scott to take us through our Q1 financial results in detail. Scott?", "Scott Maw", "Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone.", "We kicked off fiscal 2016 with another record breaking quarter and a continuation of the accelerating momentum we saw in our business throughout 2015. As Howard shared, in Q1, Starbucks operating income increased 16% year-over-year and exceeded $1 billion in a single quarter for the first time ever. And we delivered a strong operating margin of 19.7%, 60 basis points over last year.", "Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.46 compares to GAAP EPS of $0.65 in Q1 2015, noteworthy is the Q1 2015 included a gain of $0.26 on the acquisition of Starbucks Japan. Excluding certain Starbucks Japan related items, non-GAAP operating margin grew 40 basis points over Q1 of last year to a quarterly record 19.9% and non-GAAP EPS also increased 15% year-over-year and reached a quarterly record of $0.46.", "For Q1 operating margin, strong sales leverage and favorability and cost of good sold was partially offset by the impact of our partner in digital investments. Also Q1 revenue growth included 2 points of negative foreign exchange impact and non-GAAP EPS growth included 5 points of negative foreign exchange impact.", "I will now take you through the individual segment performance in Q1. Americas our largest business segment has never been stronger driving 14% operating income growth over Q1 last year and contributing a record high $935 million. Americas operating margin expanded by 80 basis points to 25.1% also a Q1 record driven primarily by sales average and excellent management around cost of good sold. The margin improvement we saw in Q1 in the Americas is even more significant when considering that the vast bulk of our partner in digital investments began in our Q2 last year, so we will not begin lapping those investments until next quarter.", "The increase in partnering digital investments is reflected in the details of our margin change as store operating expenses increased 80 basis points as a percentage of retail revenue, a figure that includes 120 basis points of impact from these investments. We see moderate margin expansion in the Americas business for the full year 2016 despite the significant investments we continue to make.", "Moving on to our China Asia-Pacific segment, on a GAAP basis, CAP operating income grew 17% over Q1 last year to a new quarterly record of $127 million. GAAP operating margin declined 240 basis points to 19.4%, due primarily to the impact of the ownership change for Starbucks Japan, offset by positive sales leverage.", "On a non-GAAP basis, CAP operating income increased 20% over Q1 last year. Operating margin, excluding the full 330 basis point impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan, increased 90 basis points, driven primarily by strong sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations, partially offset by higher store operating expenses.", "By way of reminder, our Q1 2015 results in CAP reflect pre-acquisition joint venture accounting treatment for the first five weeks of the quarter and our stores in Japan are included in our global comp store base in December, consistent with our established policy.", "Given the complexity of modeling our CAP segment in the period immediately following the Japan ownership change, I thought it would be helpful to reiterate that factoring in the impact of adding over 1,000 stores in Japan into the fiscal 2016 calculation, we expect CAP comps to land in the mid-single digits. Noteworthy is that our year one performance in Japan significantly exceeded the assumptions built into our acquisition model on each of comps, revenue and operating income, supporting the tremendous optimism we have around our performance in Japan in the years ahead.", "Projected revenue growth in CAP will be in the mid-teens for the year, reflecting excellent growth in all of our major markets and a small benefit from the change in Japan ownership, partially offset by ongoing foreign-exchange headwinds. We still see CAP margins flat to down slightly compared to 2015 levels.", "Noteworthy is that we expect Q2 revenue growth and operating margin to be somewhat lower than the average for the year due to the impact of seasonality in our largest CAP markets.", "EMEA's operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 15.4%, principally driven by gains on the sales of assets to our licensees, partially offset by somewhat lower margins in our license business resulting from higher cost of goods sold and the impact of lower sales in company-owned stores, especially during holidays. EMEA's performance was particularly strong given the impact of foreign exchange and challenges to top-line growth following the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris.", "The strength and diversity of our EMEA portfolio were further punctuated in Q1 by strong comp performance from our license stores which delivered comp store sales growth in the high single digits. While operating income in EMEA declined slightly from the prior year to $48 million, the strength of our underlying business and our expectation of a gradual return to normal operating conditions in the region gives us confidence that EMEA operating margins for the full fiscal year 2016 will still approach 15%, as we communicated to you last quarter.", "Channel Development's operating margin increased 210 basis points to 37.7% and segment operating income reached a quarterly record $193 million, 23% over Q1 last year. Another record quarter from our North American coffee partnership business with Pepsi and cost of goods sold favorability were the primary driver of channel development's margin improvement in Q1.", "As Mike mentioned, profitability growth was ahead of expectation due to strong market share gains across all of our key business lines and excellent execution in operations. For the full year, we continue to expect moderate margin expansion in channel development over the prior year.", "As I stated at the outset, Starbucks had a very strong Q1 with solid revenue growth and impressive margin expansion. For Q2, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.38 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.39, representing non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to 18%.", "Let me take a moment to reiterate the EPS ranges for fiscal 2016 we provided to you last quarter. GAAP EPS in the range of $1.84 to $1.86 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.87 to $1.89, including the 53rd week, which adds approximately $0.06 to Q4. This represents 18% to 20% EPS growth for the year.", "For the full year, foreign exchange is now expected to be a negative impact on revenue growth by 2 points and negatively impact non-GAAP EPS growth by 3 points, each up 1 full point from our previous guidance. Foreign exchange headwinds and our willingness to accelerate and add to our partner and digital investments as we see opportunity are driving our decision not to increase our full-year EPS guidance despite our performance in Q1.", "There seems to be some question that we have lowered guidance for the year. As you can see, our full-year EPS guidance is completely consistent with last quarter despite the headwinds I just mentioned. Revenue growth is also expected to remain within our previous target range of 10% or greater on a 52-week basis with the 53rd week adding approximately 2 points to this figure. Given the strong comp performance we experienced this quarter, we remain confident in our ability to again deliver global comp sales growth somewhat above the mid-single digits for the year.", "We now expect investments in our partners and digital initiatives to total between $275 million and $300 million globally in 2016 compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. This slight increase from our previous guidance range is driven by digital projects and supported by the strong results we are seeing from our investments to date, and the significant opportunities that lie ahead for us. And by driving industry-leading comp growth, record revenues, record profitability and a reduction in partner attrition compared to a 5 point increase in attrition in the industry at large, these investments are continuing to pay off in a very big and demonstrable way.", "Noteworthy is that while our comp growth overall remains very strong in today's challenging retail environment, comps are the strongest in stores where partner attrition is the lowest, a function of the deep connection our partners build over time with our customers.", "And ROIC in Q1 increased by approximately 100 basis points, reflecting the fact that the vast majority of our investments are beating our targeted hurdle rates. This applies particularly to Mobile Order & Pay where our expected return continues to be several times our consolidated ROIC.", "We continue to expect consolidated operating margins for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly related to 2015 on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.", "Moving onto commodities, with 2016 coffee needs nearly fully priced, we continue to expect a slightly favorable impact for the year. We are now beginning to price our coffee needs for fiscal 2017 and we'll provide updates as we lock in meaningful volumes. We continue to expect to add approximately 1,800 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, 700 in the Americas, 900 in China Asia-Pacific and 200 in EMEA. The outlook for our effective tax rate continues to be between 34% and 35% and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016.", "Finally, we increased total cash returned to shareholders by more than 20% to over $500 million in Q1 and we have significantly and opportunistically increased our buyback activity since quarter end, given strong cash flows during the holiday period and recent equity market dynamics.", "Q1 of fiscal 2016 marks our seventh consecutive quarter of consolidated revenue growth in excess of 10%, our ninth consecutive quarter of operating margin in excess of 15%, and our 12 consecutive quarter of non-GAAP EPS growth greater than 15%. And we see significant opportunities to continue and as appropriate selectively increase or accelerate investments in order to support this historical level of performance as we drive annual revenues to the $21 billion mark.", "The key today, as always, is to identify and to balance the right combination of targeted disciplined growth across the business with the appropriate levels of investment necessary to drive and support such growth.", "Finally, what is particularly exciting is that, despite our recent record performance, we still have clear line of sight on multiple opportunities in each of our segments and around the world to further accelerate top-line growth and deliver outsized profits in the future. The team and the strategic framework we have in place together with our proven ability to execute gives us confidence that disciplined increases in the speed and size of our investments when the right opportunities present themselves is smart business and the right thing to do for our customers, partners and shareholders over the long-term. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year.", "With that, we will turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Keith Siegner from UBS.", "Keith Siegner", "Thank you very much. Just a quick question for me in thinking about the food attach and direct sales growth rates because those are monstrous numbers. If we think about what's driving this, and maybe, Kevin, this is for you, how much is Mobile Order & Pay adding to the food sales? Is this innovation on product? Is it recipes, promotions through the MSR network? Is it the placement in-store with some of the remodel work you've done? What do you think is really driving these big food numbers? And is it continued tweaks or expansion of Mobile Order & Pay that really keeps this going? Thanks.", "Kevin Johnson", "Yes. Thanks for the question Keith. I'll comment and then I'll hand over to Cliff to share some more color around it. I think, number one; we've been on a strategy around new occasions that had us investing in food and beverage innovation. And I think number one that's driving it is that as we've continued to tune the food portfolio, I think we certainly have dialed in, in the morning daypart and what we've done to complement the food items with our breakfast sandwiches, I think for lunch and afternoon daypart the Bistro Boxes and how we are dialing in there. And then we are laying the foundation for evening. So I think it's, number one, it's the innovation redundant food and how that's been presented to the customer in the stores. I think that's a big part of it.", "Certainly, digital helps because we can target offerings to get customers to try new things. And so what we find is, once we encourage trial that starts to lead to repeatability. So let me hand over to Cliff to add a little bit more color behind what we're doing in the stores to help drive that.", "Cliff Burrows", "Yes. Thanks Kevin. And Keith, it's really an ongoing program. We now have some authority in our breakfast sandwich range and we continue to refine both the product and our availability and we enhance our skills at both offering the product to customers through displays and through the partner confidence in sharing the product.", "One of the changes we made in Q2 last year was we introduced a food benefit for partners in the U.S. who were working on shift, they could have free food. And that I think has really helped them build confidence and it's probably the best practice we've had with beverage for many years, so they are very proud of the product. We are continuing to enhance that range basing it off breakfast, but now in lunch and Bistro Box, as Kevin mentioned, has grown 65% and we own that format and we consider that another way that we can grow our range.", "So it's about us having a confidence around food, having an authority around food and working on quality, variety, availability and our selling skills of our partners. So all in all, it's going well and we have a lot more runway to continue to build food.", "Kevin Johnson", "Yes. And then the personalization in the digital platform is just allowing us the one-on-one marketing capability that's driving trial. And I think that's a key aspect. So thanks for the question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe", "Great. Hi. Thank you. The question is on the partner investments that you've been doing in the Americas. And certainly, it was very evident in this quarter as store operating expense was up 80 basis points year-over-year despite 9% comp. So my question is how much do you view that investment that you've been making in partners really as a specific driver of comps over the past four quarters?", "And as we think about lapping some of the investments that were made in the second quarter of 2016, does Starbucks have an opportunity to continue to invest in their partners, to continue to invest in margin as a way to get outside sales, or can you achieve outside sales levels and actually begin to get leverage on that line?", "Cliff Burrows", "John, its Cliff. The investments we are making in our partners, both in the technology side to give them the tools to improve the way they do the work and also in them as partners and the salaries and benefits. We are certainly seeing strengthening engagements, reduction in turnover at partner level and we are seeing the opportunity to invest also in hours to capture more of the opportunity that presents itself. Certainly, it has helped us cope with the benefits from Mobile Order & Pay and we have seen growth at peak times across all of our markets and we've seen a strengthening in our weekend business and this is what we've been investing in hours, we are investing in the quality and retention of our partners.", "Mike Conway", "John, I think I would add and you may recall, if you go back to the second quarter of last year when we introduced these partner investments, we started to see an acceleration of the business in comps and profitability. And that continued every quarter as we increase those investments and I would argue this quarter is a further acceleration of that.", "Also, in 2016, we are starting to make these partner and digital investments internationally, not a big number in Q1, but as we move throughout the year, we are so convinced by the results that we are seeing in the U.S., we are starting to do some things in China, in Canada, and in the U.K. So we are completely convinced it's all tied together.", "Operator", "Your question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia", "Hi. Good afternoon. Howard, I think you alluded to potentially going a different route with the K-Cups in the future and maybe not partnering with Keurig. Can you kind of give us some more detail on what that might look like as it relates to Starbucks either from an upfront cost perspective or an ongoing margin perspective?", "Howard Schultz", "Let me say it this way. Regardless of what we decide to do, there would be no dilution whatsoever in our current ability to deliver to the market or retain the margin which has been so attractive since we started. We are in a unique position. We have the leading share. We know customers buy the brewer because of Starbucks. And it's a wait-and-see situation. But the most important thing is, we are reaffirming to the market and our customers they will have an ongoing stream of K-Cups and there will be no dilution whatsoever in terms of our ability to maintain supply regardless of who is making it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Palmer from RBC Capital.", "David Palmer", "Thanks. I'm wondering about the learnings from Mobile Order & Pay as you are now fully rolled out across the country and that's been in some areas like the Pacific Northwest for many months. Specifically how incremental do you think it's been inter-synced to your sales and in what way whether it be new users frequency or check? And has it continued to build in the first markets like the Northwest? Thanks.", "Adam Brotman", "Thanks David. This is Adam. So first of all, I'll take the second question, part of your question first regarding incrementality. We are not breaking that out. Of course, Mobile Order & Pay orders are driving incrementality, particularly at our busiest stores at peak. We are seeing incremental occasions that come from the convenience itself, plus throughputs, efficiency and line blocking benefits that we are seeing. So in our busiest stores in particular, we are seeing the incrementality that we had hoped for.", "In terms of the learnings, I can tell you that we have -- we have just scratched the surface in terms of our ability to both promote Mobile Order & Pay and provide trials to our customers because we are seeing great conversion upon trial. That's one of the learnings. And we've got this robust roadmap for additional features over the course of the rest of this year, including the ability to earn -- to use your earned My Starbucks Rewards in the Mobile Order & Pay flow, the ability at favorite stores and favorite items and of course suggested and recommended selling, which is going to be a great thing for improving attach. So all of those things are as a result of the learnings and you'll see us roll those out over the course of this year.", "Howard Schultz", "I just want to add one thing as it relates to China specifically. Having just been in China, for John and I over the last week or so, I think there is one significant difference between the young people in China and the evolution of mobile in the U.S. And that is the Chinese consumer has leapfrogged from a rotary phone to a regular phone to a cell phone and a smartphone overnight. And as a result of that, not if but when we roll out Mobile Order & Pay and mobile payment in China, the adoption that we believe we are going to have in China is going to be more significant and quicker than it has been in the U.S., which already has stunned us in terms of how quickly the U.S. customer has embraced it.", "So our growth in China is not only in terms of the 500 stores per year that we're going to add over the next five years; it's overlaying that growth with technology that we strongly believe is going to be adopted at a quicker pace than the U.S. consumer has because of how technology is embedded in the Chinese consumer's life.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason West from Credit Suisse.", "Jason West", "Thanks. Just one quick clarification and then a bigger picture question. Could you guys give us a general breakdown of the partner investment or I guess the overall investment that occurred in the first quarter relative to the full-year guidance just to give us a sense of how that's pacing? And then just a bigger picture question around some of the Rewards partnerships that you guys have talked about in the past with things like Lyft? Just wondering if there is any new deals that have been added to that portfolio and sort of the general thoughts on that.", "Howard Schultz", "Scott, do you want to take that part.", "Scott Maw", "Hi, Jason. It's Scott. So, in the first quarter, the vast majority of our partner and digital investments were in the U.S., as I stated. And it was about 120 basis points. So you can do the math on revenue, but that's the number. For the full year, the vast majority still is in the U.S. although, as we get into the back part of the year, we will talk about the other segment, but it's $275 million to $300 million for the full year. Matt?", "Matt Ryan", "We don't have a specific announcement to make today on a new partnership, but what I can tell you is, we are confident on a pathway of significant new partnerships that we will be announcing in the coming quarters. And it will fulfill our vision to make stars everywhere, the ability for customers to order stars -- to earn stars everywhere part of Starbucks experience.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass", "Thanks very much. I have two questions just on mobile ordering and digital in general. First, I'm just following up on the comments about kind of the next-generation of the app. Are there certain milestones; is there a next quarter for example generation 2 coming out that allows for example for that suggested up-selling? Or do you think you have to wait to amass several of them to kind of roll it out, just because consumers don't want keep updating their apps all the time to get the latest?", "And secondly, related to that, those who -- other have engaged in digital platforms have seen tipping points where adoption really accelerates significantly. And also you get an accelerated labor benefit. You've been able to suddenly remove a certain amount of labor from the store because it's coming in, you're getting digital orders or whatever. Do you have a sense of were those tipping points of both revenue and for labor are for Starbucks, you've already reached them or when you might expect to reach them?", "Adam Brotman", "Jon, this is Adam. First of all, in terms of waiting for features, we are not planning on doing that. The way we approach it is we are constantly at work adding new features, both in the U.S. and around the globe, on both our iOS an Android platform. And so you saw that just in the last week as we not only launched the Spotify integration in the U.S. but we also added Mobile Order & Pay to Android in the U.K. and Canada also just in the last week. So you can see how busy we are.", "The future enhancements to mobile ordering that I mentioned are going to happen when those features are ready, so they are going to happen over the course of the year. We are not going to bunch them up, and so you will see those happen on a continual basis.", "And in terms of the tipping point, I would say that we are just continuing to see acceleration of the adoption of Mobile Order & Pay. As Kevin mentioned in his remarks, this has been happening from the beginning and we saw acceleration through the first quarter and even into January as now we're up to 6 million mobile orders per month run rate. And we anticipate that to continue. And I also mentioned that we are just scratching the surface in terms of awareness and trial. So I think we are still approaching the tipping point, frankly.", "Scott Maw", "Hi, John. I just want to add one thing to that and it relates to the incrementality we are seeing on Mobile Order & Pay. So Kevin talked about, in the U.S. business, we saw the fastest morning daypart revenue growth that we've seen in over five years, so biggest morning daypart in over five years. And we can trace back a good portion of that uptake in performance this quarter to our busiest stores, and in those busiest stores, we can trace that back to Mobile Order & Pay introduction. And so it's aligned with what we are seeing in our results. It's aligned with the daypart. I would argue it's aligned with food attach and capacity and we're just getting started.", "Cliff Burrows", "So just to -- John, it's Cliff -- to follow up on your points about tipping point and labor. I would say that what is most exciting of all is these higher volume stores that are seeing the greatest adoption and usage of Mobile Order & Pay, which is growing capacity and it's allowing us to reach volumes in those stores that set new levels for us.", "So, I think that tipping point is happening in some stores and it's happening in a really meaningful way in the high volume stores, which is great.", "And in terms of labor, we are not looking at it that way. We are looking at using the labor to continually serve the customers that are there, continue to build relationships with our customers and enhance the experience. So I think it's a continuous process of check and adjust, increase capacity in the store, hopefully have more Mobile Order & Pay orders and then grow our labor accordingly. And that's the way we are looking at it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Charles from Cowen.", "Andrew Charles", "Great. Thanks. Howard or Adam, just to follow-up on an earlier point, as we look back over the last several years to the trajectory of mobile payment sales growth, do you believe, between the digital infrastructure you have in place as well as consumer awareness, your digital prowess should lead growth in the mobile ordering sales mix to directionally outpace the growth you experienced in your mobile payment sales?", "Howard Schultz", "Yes. I can't give you the specifics of that, but clearly we are already demonstrating, if you look at the trajectory of these numbers, there's no question that this segment of the business and this foundation of the ecosystem we are building is going to grow the business. And that is going to have a significant effect on the overall growth of the business, both in the U.S. and around the world. And going back to China, I think having just come back there, I think we just can't wait to introduce mobile payment, Mobile Order & Pay, in China because it's going to be a runaway success.", "John Culver", "This is John. Just let me add to what Howard just said on China and the mobile order and payment there. We are seeing, just with the Starbucks card alone, that over 40% of our transactions are coming through China on the Starbucks card. And that gives us great optimism around what mobile order and payment can be in China. So, we are very bullish on that. Matt?", "Matt Ryan", "This is Matt Ryan here. Just in terms of the customer segments and the way we look at it, our core customer growth is strong. The loyalty customers, we have people participating in MSRs, is growing significantly faster than our regular customer base. People using the mobile form of loyalty is growing even faster than that. And people using Mobile Order & Pay is growing even faster than that. So you actually see a cumulative benefit to the ecosystem at play.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karen Short from Deutsche Bank.", "Karen Short", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of questions on China. I guess the first question is, can you give some color on what the impact of Japan would have been on the comps, or CAP comp? And then I guess, within the China comp, I'm wondering at this stage if you would be willing to break out the comp by daypart, so morning, afternoon, evening and any color on how that's evolved over the last several quarters? Thanks.", "Howard Schultz", "We don't break out comps by country within the segment, but let me say it this way. We had over 10 consecutive years of positive comps and positive traffic in China. The success we are enjoying in China is really kind of highlighted by this past quarter. We opened over 150 stores in China this past quarter, the most we've ever opened in our history and it was the strongest class of new stores we have ever opened.", "In terms of daypart, I think, in addition to the technology we've talked about that we will be introducing in China, perhaps the most exciting aspect of the core China business looking to the future is that we are sitting with an incredibly strong level of unit economics in Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities that now are almost 100 cities in China and we are doing that for the most part without truly establishing a morning ritual.", "And there's no doubt in our minds if we look at every market we've opened around the world, including those markets in Asia, that a morning ritual starts, it evolves and it occurs. And we are seeing it sporadically but enough to give us great not hope, but vindication in those stores that have been open the longest, in Beijing and Shanghai, how that is developing.", "So if you look at the unit economics in China today, which are incredibly attractive and you lay on the technology we talked about. And then we know the morning ritual is going to come. We are sitting in a business today that, as I said publicly when I was in China last week, that we believe one day could very well be larger than the U.S. business. So anyone on the call who is in any way dissuaded by our commitment or our success in China as a result of a 5% comp in the region is not only mistaken, but you are looking at the wrong metric.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino", "Hi. Good afternoon. Howard, you've talked in the past about the shift from brick-and-mortar retail to online retail creating some headwinds in the holidays for all retailers and perhaps for Starbucks. So, I was wondering if you could talk about how your business trended during the holidays specifically and perhaps how you exited the quarter relative to some of those headwinds you've talked about in the past.", "Howard Schultz", "That's a perfect question for me. So I think we said three years ago publicly that we began to envision that there would be a seismic change in consumer behavior and that seismic change was due in large part to eCommerce and smartphone shopping. I think today in the headlines you've seen just in the last three weeks store closures of almost 50 Macy's stores, 150 Walmart stores. You've got to ask yourself what's going to happen to the future of many of those malls that are anchored by those big-box retailers.", "Having said that, the investments that we made in our partner investments, which is store execution and retention of our people and the intimate relationship we have with the customer, coupled with the technology investments which have been significant, to put up 4% traffic in this environment when there isn't a retailer in the country that is putting up anything close to 1% or 2%, let alone 9% comps in the quarter in the U.S. business, and we finished very strong for the quarter.", "So we have insulated ourselves from the bricks-and-mortar problem that will face many retailers as a result of the experience that we've created, the innovation, both in product, partner investments and technology. And as people who have covered the company know, we are still opening fantastic stores in the U.S. on a base of almost 10,000. And in addition to what I said about China and the 150 stores that we just opened best-of-class, the stores that we've opened in the U.S. this year are also best-of-class in terms of revenue and return on investment. So we see no signs whatsoever that we are going to be hit in any way by this seismic change in consumer behavior because we invested ahead of the growth curve and we continue to invest in those things that are customer-facing, partner-facing and technology.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.", "Nicole Miller", "Thanks. Good afternoon. When we look at the channel development business, what's the long-term revenue and your margin opportunity? And do you imagine that it comes from or envision new and existing platforms? And if new, how can we think about that?", "Scott Maw", "Hi, Nicole. I'll start it and I think Mike can jump into the second part of the question. What we see over the long-term is double-digit revenue growth in channels every year and moderate margin expansion driven by leveraging cost of goods sold and overall operating leverage. Mike, do you want to take the second question?", "Mike Conway", "Yes. Let me take the rest. So our future performance is going to build on what you are seeing this quarter. So in the U.S., you will continue to see strength of our existing coffee business just based on the level of innovation, the loyalty that we have and the opportunity, quite honestly, for us to connect with our My Starbucks Reward down the aisle even more.", "What we haven't talked as much about yet but what is coming is the activity that we have on the international front. So you've heard me talk about many of the partnerships that we've just created in China and also in Latin America. That is primarily a ready-to-drink business for us, so we're going to leverage the strength that we've seen in the U.S. and insights we've gotten with our partnership with the North American coffee partnership and translate that into a growing business from a ready-to-drink perspective internationally.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.", "Jeff Bernstein", "Great. Thank you very much. Just two questions. One, in the European business, or EMEA, I'm just wondering whether you can talk a little bit about the softening that you saw. I didn't realize the magnitude or the impact it had on the broader European comp in terms of the obviously tragic Paris attacks. I'm just wondering if you can maybe get some color, maybe what those trends were running pre- or post- or whether it impacted other markets? I'm just trying to get a feel for whether it's just kind of a -- just a broader macro issue, or whether there's anything you think is going on just within the Starbucks numbers. And then separately, Scott, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the balance of the dividend versus the share repo and kind of your thoughts on leverage. I know you talked a lot about returning incremental cash with a share purchase and obviously dividends. Just any updated thoughts on that would be great.", "Kevin Johnson", "Yes. Jeff, this is Kevin. I'll take the first question and then I'll hand over to Scott for the second one. Fundamentally, what we saw as we track our daily comps in France, Germany and U.K., large cities in France, Germany, and the U.K., I think there was just a shift in customer behavior that showed transaction comps flat or down slightly across large cities in France, Germany and the U.K. And in this last week or so, we've seen evidence that that consumer behavior is recovering. And so I wouldn't read anything more into it than that. Scott?", "Scott Maw", "Yes. I would add two things. One to what Kevin just said, just as we look at the international segments, EMEA and CAP. This year and over the long-term, we expect significant revenue and margin expansion to continue. So if you look at EMEA for example, a few years ago, they were at breakeven. Margin was essentially zero. And we are guiding to 15% this year, which is over a 100 basis point improvement over last year. And as I said, we're going to get up towards 20% over the next handful of years in EMEA. So that is a market with significant profitability growth.", "So to your question, October looked like a really good month to us and it looked like we are right on track to what we expected for the year. And then after what happened in Paris, we've seen some softening and now it's coming back. And so full year, we haven't changed our guidance and we are not at all changing the long-term belief in what we can do and what we have been driving in EMEA.", "And in CAP, again, we've targeted around 20% this year on operating margin, which is up slightly despite the math that impacts us from the Japan acquisition. And I actually think in CAP, you'll see us move towards the low to mid 20s over five years or so from an operating margin perspective, which gets CAP right up there with the Americas business. So again, strong revenue growth. We will have mid-teen revenue growth in CAP this year. The numbers are just phenomenal. Japan has outperformed the model in every single aspect that we can look at since acquisition and we are just getting started in growing that business, working with the team over there. And Howard talked about China. And again, we've never been more bullish on that. So the international markets for the quarter had a good quarter and the outlook for the future is very strong.", "As far as the balance sheet goes, we did a little bit more buyback than dividend in that split I gave you. But I want to just remind you, Jeff that given what we saw in the holiday and what we saw in the equity markets, we've significantly increased our buybacks to the tune of roughly double already this quarter what we did in the whole quarter last year. So that will include some leverage on the balance sheet and we will continue to evaluate that as we go forward. If you look back over the last 12 months, we've returned $2.5 billion of cash to shareholders. The number is significant. And over the last few quarters that number has increased as we put the balance sheet to work a little harder, as we've discussed.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs.", "Karen Holthouse", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. One of the things and not necessarily trying to get at the China comp number, but one of the things that was talked about last quarter was some seasonality to the fourth quarter comp. And theoretically comps improving getting past the holiday and with cake gifting that was down substantially more than the rest of the business. Did that in fact materialize as we moved through the quarter?", "John Culver", "Karen, this is John. We did not see any of the seasonality come into the business in the quarter. Like Howard said, we continue to see very, very strong transaction growth. We had a record number of store openings in China and then also across the region. And we remain very bullish on the opportunity that we have going forward. Right now, we are in the throws of the Chinese New Year and we are very optimistic on what that is going to bring.", "Karen Holthouse", "And one --", "Howard Schultz", "Hello?", "John Culver", "Hello?", "Howard Schultz", "Oh, we cut her off. Anyone there?", "Operator", "Karen Holthouse, your line is open.", "Karen Holthouse", "Hi. Does your guidance include any change in the amount of stock that you intend on buying back over the course of the year, or is it exogenous from that?", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. We are currently experiencing technical difficulties. The conference will resume momentarily. Thank you.", "Durga Doraisamy", "Mike, are you there?", "Operator", "The speaker line is connected.", "Durga Doraisamy", "Mike, are you there?", "Operator", "This is the operator. The speaker line is connected.", "Durga Doraisamy", "Mike, are you there? Can you hear us?", "Operator", "This is the operator. You are connected.", "Durga Doraisamy", "Thank you, Mike. We are ready for our next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim.", "Matthew Difrisco", "Thank you, guys. I appreciate you coming back on the line there. A balance sheet question following up there on the prior question. Deferred revenues, I wonder if you can give us a little bit of a taste of what encompassing both the gift cards as well is in the years passed you have given us some reload numbers as far as what sits on cards, what sits on the digital mobile app. I would assume, with the growth of the digital Mobile Order & Pay and the digital app and sales you said were -- gift cards were 19% growth. Can you sort of encompass that and tell us what you have entering 2Q as far as balances and how that might have grown year-over-year? Thank you.", "Scott Maw", "Yes. Matt, deferred revenue is up about -- just give me a second here. I'm pulling it up. It's up about $500 million over year-end, which is about 50%. And as Adam said, we had total loads on the card of $1.9 billion. We haven't split that out recently and I don't have at my fingertips the split between what goes on card and what goes on digital, but I think the relevant numbers are the significant growth we are seeing in total loads and frankly, that's the way we look at it and then the total increase in deferred revenue balances, which is about $0.5 billion.", "Matthew Difrisco", "Excellent. Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Andy Barish from Jefferies.", "Andy Barish", "Hey, guys. Actually, just a boring G&A question. It looked like that number reported was a little bit lower than at least I was modeling. Do you have some, maybe some timing shifting with some of the technology investment or is there some FX benefit that's actually showing up in the G&A line?", "Scott Maw", "One of the reasons that G&A as a percentage of revenue is a little lower than you may have modeled is last year we had a fair bit of expense in G&A related to the Japan acquisition. And that was deal related costs and just some of integration costs and they were highest in the first quarter. So if you are modeling it as a percentage of revenues that could explain the delta you are seeing.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions. Ms. Doraisamy, are there any closing remarks?", "Durga Doraisamy", "No. That will be all. Thank you all very much for joining us this afternoon.", "Operator", "This concludes Starbucks Coffee Company's first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "Thank you. Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Joining me on the call to discuss our Q1 results are Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; and Troy Alstead, CFO. And also with us today are John Culver, Group President, China, Asia Pacific and Channel Development and Emerging Brands; Adam Brotman, Chief Digital Officer; and Curt Garner, Chief Information Officer.", "This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.", "Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.

Howard?", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. I\u2019m very pleased to discuss the record Q1 results that Starbucks announced today. Strong operating and financial performance from all business segments around the world and increase operating leverage and store efficiency enables us to deliver record quarterly revenue of $4.2 billion, record quarterly operating margin of 19.2%, record quarterly operating income of $814 million and record quarterly EPS of $0.71 per share.", "Strong customer response to food and beverage innovation contributed solid Q1 comp sales growth of 5%, consisting with our previous mid single-digit guidance representing our 16th consecutive quarter of 5% comps or greater.", "Noteworthy is that the 5% comp growth driven by our important EMEA region with over 2,000 stores, was a strongest growth in more than three years, demonstrating the success of our strategy to transform our EMEA business based on the learnings from our U.S. transformation.", "Also, noteworthy, is that our Q1 U.S. comps were approximately twice the national retail sales average during holiday shopping period this season. And that our Q1 results do not reflect the significant future sales benefit from the year-over-year increase of $230 million in deferred revenue over $1 billion resulting from extremely strong new Starbucks Gift Card activation and Starbucks Card reloads in Q1.", "At the outset, I want to take a moment to comment on two pronounced shifts in consumer shopping behavior that retailers experienced, but that we unlike many retailers or any competitor were prepared for this past holiday season and explaining why and how Starbucks global business will increasingly benefit from the acceleration and convergence of these shifts going forward. Then I will provide an overview of segment performance in Q1 and Troy will take you though Q1 financial and operating results in detail.", "Holiday 2013 was the first in which many traditional bricks and mortar retailers experienced in-store foot traffic give way to online shopping in a major way. Customers research, compare prices and then bought the brands and items they wanted online, frequently using a mobile device to do so.", "This was also the first holiday in which consumers embraced the convenience and flexibility afforded by physical and digital gift cards with the passion. Instead of gifting a particular item, many consumers instead choose to give the gift of choice. Starbucks was prepared for both of these shifts having invested over many years in the creation and development of proprietary world class digital and mobile payment and card technology and expertise. This expertise and the assets that support it enabled us to seamlessly process more than 40 million new Starbucks card activation valued at over $610 million in the U.S. and Canada alone in Q1, including over 2 million new Starbucks card activations per day in the days immediately leading up to Christmas and $1.4 billion of Starbucks card loads globally. ", "Each of these figures represented a significant increase over both last year and candidly our most optimistic projections for this year making Starbucks one of the very few small handful of retailers to benefit from the transfers of reward [ph] store sales to online sales and the gifting of choice. ", "Even more, the sheer magnitude of the $1.4 billion loaded with deposit cards in Q1 is the opportunity presented by the millions of customers that will be visiting our stores to redeem these cards in the future. Experience tells us that many gift card recipients are new customers for Starbucks and their visits are providing us with the unique and power opportunity to introduce them to the Starbucks experience, invite them into my cover of rewards loyalty program and inspire them to become part of the Starbucks daily ritual. ", "Today with only 10 million customers actively using our mobile payment app, over 7.3 million active my cover of reward [ph] in U.S. alone, over a half of them at home are gold status members and a figure approaching 5 million mobile transactions taking place in our stores each week. Some [ph] integrated mobile and world app technology is by far the undisputed leader in digital retail technology. ", "Together mobile and Starbucks card payments represent over 30% of total U.S. payment. This powerful technological advantage combines with our robust pipeline of food and beverage innovations and Starbucks\u2019 recognition as one of the world\u2019s most respected and most trusted consumer brands will provide us with a winning hand as mobile, card and online sales trends continue to converge and accelerate around the world and into the future. ", "Let me turn your attention to the Americas. Starbucks Americas segment now comprising over 13,000 stores had another strong quarter with revenues up 8% and comp sales up 5%, including a solid 4% increase in traffic. Contributing to Americas performance was the success of our holiday beverage offerings, including both Pumpkin Spice Latte and our holiday beverage frio [ph] and strong food sales, including increased customer acceptance and additional benefits from the ongoing rollout of La Boulange. ", "As we entered 2014, Starbucks Americas segment is benefitting from new store development and existing store renovation programs that are driving increased store efficiency and throughput, enabling us to deliver both an enhanced customer experience and increased profitability. The success of these app efforts are apparent with our newest class of stores on track to average over $1.2 million in year one sales, exceeding our best in class investment ratio of 2 to 1.", "For example, a new class of drive-in stores is providing Starbucks with the unique opportunity to connect with customers on the go and represent a tremendous growth opportunity for us both domestically and internationally. In the U.S., highly profitable drive [ph] account for 40% of our company operated store portfolio and remain a focal point of our store development efforts. And the more we broaden and expand our drive thru program, the more we see white space and opportunity for drive-thrus in the future. ", "Licensed stores comprising 40% of our Americas store portfolio representing roughly half of the 600 net new stores and plan to open in the Americas in fiscal 2014, also present a compelling growth opportunity for us. We opened 50 licensed stores in Canada in Q1, including 30 in a single day. The net additions facilitating rapid growth licensed stores utilize less of our capital, provide strong insurance and floor access to otherwise unavailable high traffic retail venues such as hotels, airports, rail stations, grocery stores, big parks , and fast growing international markets such as Mexico, a market that delivered extremely strong comp growth inQ1.", "Overall licensed store [ph] revenue increased 15% in Q1, the highest growth rate in six quarters. But because of the value of our global brand, we are receiving more [indiscernible] today from potential licensees than any other time in our history.", "Let me turn your attention to new platforms and again with Teavana. A year after the acquisition of Teavana, we are more convinced than ever that we have the opportunities to transform the tea category to the way we have transformed coffee all around the world. Recent research confirms that Teavana now enjoys the highest level of awareness of any super premium tea brand and like Starbucks, Teavana had a solid Q1.", "Now one year into the integration of Teavana, we are poised to begin the rollout of additional stores in the hills of the successful opening of our first two Teavana tea bars in New York City and Seattle. These two beautiful new stores are already providing us the key insights that will help us achieve our goal of combining and leveraging Teavana\u2019s strength and authority around loose-leaf tea and tea merchandising and Starbucks for entertaining its prudential consumer environment, innovative, handcrafted beverages and a retail store development to create a new retail platform and a unique international premium teahouse experience.", "I would now look for Teavana to bring breakthrough innovation to the tea category in the U.S. and Canada this spring and summer and to the international markets in the years ahead. Now beyond tea, another important area of innovation and interest for us is premium handcrafted, cold carbonated beverages.", "This category is by far the fastest growing segment of over $140 billion global carbonation industry and the results of the tests we conducted in stores in select U.S. and Asian market last summer exceeded our most optimistic expectations.", "The excitement that was created as baristas carbonated, our customer\u2019s favorite drinks and the fantastic innovation and interaction that follow, cemented our interest in the category and the opportunity to elevate the cold carbonation category with a premium handcrafted offerings in our stores.", "Look for handcrafted cold carbonated beverages in several stores that will drive full attachment, create an incremental leaf tea for our customers and create a new big pot for us in the months and quarters ahead.", "Turning to China and Asia Pacific. If you want our important rapidly expanding China Asia-Pacific segment, currently comprising over 4000 stores in 14 countries, including 209 net new stores in Q1, delivered strong revenue growth of 25% and exceptional strong comp growth of 8%. These are best-in-class results for any retail or restaurant operating at our scale in Asia.", "This month, Starbucks celebrated 15th anniversary in China, a market we open with one store in Beijing in 1999. We have more than 1000 stores today and China remains on track to become Starbucks\u2019 largest and most successful market outside the U.S.", "Just in time for the lunar New Year, we reached a major milestone which they view of Starbucks gift cards in China. China customers responded to the Starbucks\u2019 card overwhelmingly in a positive way with initial sales once again far in excess of our plan and in many ways mirroring our U.S. experience.", "We currently offer the Starbucks card in different aspects of our My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program in \u201812 to \u201814 China Asia-Pacific region markets in which we\u2019d operate. In Japan and Hong Kong, we recently made it even faster and more convenient to customers to give the gift of Starbucks\u2019 choice online with Starbucks eGift.", "In India, momentum continues where in Q1, we opened a beautiful new flagship store in the Garden City of Bangalore and we continue to accelerate that growth. We now operate 34 stores in four cities and customer demand for Starbucks stores throughout India literally is at a fever pitch. We are delighted with the performance of our joint venture with Tata among the most respected companies in India and we are poised to grow sizable portfolio stores in India over the next two years.", "Overall, we plan to -- overall we plan to get a total of 750 new stores across China Asia-Pac in 2014, including both our 100 stores in Singapore next month and continue to be driven by the exciting opportunity to introduce our elevated, differentiated and locally relevant Starbucks\u2019 experience to millions of new customers in this important part of the world in the years ahead.", "Let me turn your attention to EMEA which in many ways has really had a wonderful performance and I think it is consistent with the guidance we gave you year ago in terms of our confidence that we would turn EMEA around. Starbucks\u2019 important EMEA segment now comprising more than 2000 stores had a particularly noteworthy Q1 with revenues increasing 11% and exceptionally strong comp sales growth of 5%.", "We opened a total of 64 net new company operated and licensed stores in EMEA in Q1, including our first store in Monaco and [indiscernible] our first ever store aboard a train on the Swish rail line running between Geneva airport and St. John. We are on plan to open 12 of 150 net new stores in fiscal 2014.", "EMEA\u2019s Q1 performance underscores continued execution against our transnational agenda in that region and the success of the strategy that includes enhancing our new store customer experience, showcasing innovative locally relevant food and beverage products and focusing on company operated licensed and franchise stores for our new growth \u2013 for our new server [ph].", "Licensed store revenue in EMEA grew by 38% in Q1 due to the combination of new stores and strong performance in several key markets, including double digit comp growth in the Middle East and North Africa where we now have 335 stores. While we continue to be very encouraged by the progress we have made in EMEA, as I previously stated, we are determined to see these projects continue till the region reached its full potential.", "Turning to channel development. Our channel development segment posted total revenues of $401 million in Q1, representing solid 7% growth in Q1 over last year and continues to grow market share and [indiscernible] channels outside of our retail stores.", "The strong direct selling relationship we have built with retail is enabling us to elevate and differentiate our brand, increase our presence and enhance our product position and the deepening and strengthening of these retail relationships combined with new product offerings and initiatives currently underway gives us confidence that channel development growth will accelerate as the year progresses and at the same [ph] it will deliver both double digit top and bottom line growth in fiscal 2014 and beyond. ", "Premium single cup is the fastest growing segment in at home coffee. We have grown our share to a current 18% of the segment over the last two years. Since launch, we have now sold way over 1 billion [indiscernible] and 200 million stick [ph] and we continue to build and expand both platforms. ", "In January following strong customer demand we introduced a new innovative line of [indiscernible] offerings including \u2013 over the course of this year you will see a significant expansion of our line of key cup offerings including flavor [indiscernible] in the key --. We continue to innovate and add to our leading market share of the premium package compensating as well and now really a remarkable 26% share of that segment. And we continue to build, discover refreshed [ph] platform and are already seeing the early success of our Starbucks signature, our merchandise initiative just in time for the rollout of our new ready to drink packaging in the spring.", "Some of those continues to offer the world\u2019s first and only cross-sale channel loyalty and rewards program with more 2.2 million rewards that was earned by customers in the first seven months since My Starbucks Rewards starts and [indiscernible]. Starbucks\u2019 unique amazing of value rewards and premium positioning will enable us to continue to aid to our leading position and market share in CPG channels.", "A few final thoughts before I hand the call over to Troy. I think this part of my remarks are very important. Over the last month or so, I have heard many traditional brick and mortar retailers attribute the downturn in their core business during holiday. The factors such as a shortened holiday shopping season, a weekend consumer, the U.S. government shutdown and [indiscernible] but secondly, those explanations ignore a larger fundamental truth. That truth is that traditional brick and mortar retailing is an inflection point. No longer are many retailers only required to compete with stores on the other side of the street. They are now required to compete with stores on the other side of the country. Navigating the seismic shift will continue to be very, very difficult for me.", "But I firmly believe and I admit Starbucks solid 4% increase in traffic in Q1 validates that we will be among the small group of retailers to gain from the macro transfers of brick and mortar retail sales to online sales underpinning this belief are free dynamic unique Starbucks it manages. ", "First, Starbucks offers an experience that cannot be replicated or copy. The power of our brand, our heritage in coffee, beverage innovation, customization and the deep emotional connection we have with our customers rooted in longstanding trust and respect that our 200,000 Starbucks partner share with our customers provides us with an overwhelming competitive advantage, not only domestically but around the world.", "Second, we invested and continue to invest well ahead of the curve and today have world-leading proprietary digital, social, mobile payment and card technologies and assets. These assets are enabling us to broaden and deepen our connection to customers, enhance overall Starbucks customer experience and further differentiating distance ourselves from competitors.", "And we have a full pipeline of new technological innovations introducing in the quarters ahead that will fully leverage these assets and provide us with even greater benefits into the future. And we are just beginning to appreciate the full magnitude and possibilities of the Starbucks mobile payment platform opportunity. And third as our strong traffic in Q1 demonstrates the deep sense of community and human connection that our stores provide our customers as their preferred place. It is only going to become more reformed and more relevant around the world in the future.", "Let me say in closing, I could not be more confident that Starbucks unique combination of physical and digital assets makes us one of the very few consumer brands with a national and global footprint to be in a position to build market share and benefit from the seismic retail and consumer shifts underway.", "I will now turn the call over to Troy.", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, Howard and good afternoon everyone. The strongest start to fiscal \u201914 across all of our operating segments led to consolidated results that eclipsed every meaningful record.", "Revenues of $4.2 billion from a 12% increase over last Q1. Our 5% global comparable store sales growth was the largest driver and particularly encouraging is the strength of sales growth around the world. In fact, this was the first quarter since Q4 of 2010 that all regions posted comp growth of 5% or better.", "And traffic continues to fuel that comp growth, growing 4% in the quarter with a 1% contribution from average ticket. The strong performance from our more than 1,500 net new startups stores opened over the past year also contributed to the revenue growth in Q1.", "Consolidated operating income grew 29% to a record $814 million in the first quarter. This includes a $20 million credit as a result of paying our obligation in the Kraft settlement earlier than anticipated. Operating margin expanded 260 basis points to 19.2% in Q1, far above any quarter we\u2019ve ever had even when excluding litigation credit.", "Operating margin expansion was due largely to the lasting of several non-routine expenses in the Americas segment in Q1 of last year. Commodity costs improvement and sales leverage also contributed towards the expansion.", "Earnings per share grew 25% to $0.71 per share in the first quarter to a record even when excluding the $0.02 impact of the litigation credit. Our tax rate of 34% was up significantly over the last Q1, as we lost an $18 million benefit recorded at Q1 of last year, primarily from state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years.", "Our performance this quarter clearly demonstrates the comp growth in the heart of our target range, resulting significant gains and profitability and margin expansion, a testament to the efficient use of capital and strong financial discipline that is competitive throughout the organization.", "Now, let me take a few moments to briefly touch on the results from each of our operating segments. In the Americas, another solid holiday season and excellent operational executions drove revenue, operation margin and operating income to record levels.", "Revenue grew by 8% in the first quarter as strong sales growth in existing stores and sales from 735 net new stores opened this past year, pushed Americas quarterly revenues to over $3 billion for the first time ever. Comp growth of 5% was driven by a 4% increase in transactions.", "We did see some softening of traffic and comp growth in December. However, our Q1 comp growth was an extraordinarily strong delivery given the shifts in consumer behavior that we kind of faced during the holiday as Howard mentioned.", "I will also mention food among our comp growth drivers in Q1. Food continues to be a disproportionate driver to our comp and product launches helping to propel those results. There have been very significant successes thus far, including for some sales that have doubled versus our prior offering.", "Make no mistake, however, this is a very complex rollout. We are significantly up leveling our core food offering across more than 10,000 U.S. stores in two years time. The cost was that we are leveraging the learnings from the introduction in many markets in fiscal \u201913 to quickly optimize implementation of stores launched this year. This includes labor deployment strategies, product assortment choices and marketing and display optimization.", "Overall, we are as optimistic as ever about this opportunity. In addition to the solid revenue growth in Q1, Americas operating income of $732 million was 24% higher than last Q1 and operating margin of 23.8% reflected in expansion of 300 basis points. Included in the expansion was the lapping of [indiscernible] from last Q1 including our leadership conference, gate in-charges [ph] and the impacts of superstorm Sandy. However even after backing those [ph], our largest and most mature business of the Americas continue to drive margin expansion, we are also making investments in labor and food [indiscernible].", "Not only with our 23.8% operating margin, the big improvement from last Q1, it was a full 150 basis points higher than any other quarter we have ever had, and opportunity remains. Labor and store maintenance are all under the microscope and we are expecting this technology to enhance the [indiscernible] schedules and robust monetization program will all deliver improvements. ", "As we continue to invest in our people, including maintaining world class benefits [ph] that go above and beyond requirements of the [indiscernible], we see greater stability of practically run stores. This means we can spend more time focusing our customers, ensuring they receive the one of kind personalized [indiscernible] experience that drove our solid floor balance result this quarter.", "As we move now to Europe, the Middle East and Africa or EMEA, where the first one represented a continuation of the great stride we are making in the region. Revenues of $340 million in Q1 grew 11% over the prior year. This is truly a great start to the year. In fact, the $33 million in Q1 revenue growth was higher than what we delivered for the entirety of fiscal \u201913.", "There were contributors to our top line coverage, certainly time to a slow but positive retaining economic recovery including declining unemployment in the UK have been helpful. Beyond that there are strong signals that our strategy emulate consisting of licensed store growth along with the heightened focus on the store experience is paying off.", "Licensed stores are the largest contributors to the revenue growth with company operated cost growth following closely behind. The 5% comp growth in Q1 was generated by a 3% increase in transactions. Perhaps our most solid sign out of EMEA, the fact that the improvements we are seeing are broad based. All of our major markets are showing improved, the momentum is building for a great year. Our top line momentum and disciplined stores basing across EMEA translated into a strong bottom line as well.", "Q1 operating income in the region grew 34 million, 50% higher than last Q1. And operating margin expanded 250 basis points to 9.9% as the portfolio shift to higher margin licensed stores drove our highest quarterly operating margin ever. We are encouraged with the progress we are making in EMEA and excited about what is to come.", "Now for China and Asia Pacific continues to be our fastest growing and highest margin region. In the first quarter, Caf\u00e9 revenues grew 25% to $267 million. Our record number of store openings and a strong performance in Q1 were key driving force behind our revenue growth.", "Additionally company operated comp growth which had 8% represented continuation of our strong consistent growth in the region [indiscernible] higher, 7 percentage points to the comp growth were due to higher transactions, the acceleration over Q4. Two year comp growth also accelerated to 19% in the first quarter. Strong brand awareness, relevant core promotional product offerings and the increased usage of the [indiscernible] loyalty program all contributed.", "Caf\u00e9 operating income grew 12% in Q1 to $81 million. Operating margin of 30.4% represented a 330 basis point reduction over last Q1. Margins were negatively impacted by a decline in profit merger venture in Japan. This was driven primarily by the [indiscernible] again but also the timing the investments made in later for upgrade and [indiscernible] by the extended cyclic traffic we experienced. As both our bases expanded in the Japanese economy re-invigorated over the past several quarters. ", "Excluding Japan, our caf\u00e9 operating margin expanded slightly overlapped Q1 despite continued margin pressure resulting from the ongoing strategic portfolio mix shift [indiscernible] stores. Our outstanding performance in mainland China is a major reason \u2013 offset that impact from that shift of the portfolio composition. As China\u2019s revenue and operating income growth easily outpaced in the region. Strong new store performance, -- leader management and sales leverage are driving our success there. ", "In channel development, global sales of single serve products and continued growth in food service combining our revenues higher by 7% to $401 million. These revenue drivers were partially offset by the impact of the lower pricing on packaged coffee. All we are going to share this category until we lap the list price reduction initiated last May, we won\u2019t see full impact to our revenue growth.

Our new holiday Blend K-cups were extremely well-received, helping to propel sales in the U.S. food, drug, and mass channel higher by 65% in the final four weeks of the quarter, which significantly outpace the category over that same time period.", "Additionally, we continue to gain traction on Verismo which delivered solid holiday sales. Unit sold grew over last few months as we nearly double the year-over-year door count with the addition of several keys special to retailers.", "Verismo is an element of our strategy to capitalize on the highly competitive single cost base. We will continue to invest in the single-serve business which we believe will be an important driver of our long-term growth.", "Operating income in channel also grew a very healthy 23% to $119 million in Q1. Operating margin expanded 370 basis points to 29.6% due largely the 340 basis points of favorability from more coffee cost.", "Lower pricing on packaged coffee and strong promotions in the quarter partially offset our coffee cost favorability. However that was offset by favorability in other operating expenses as a result of decreased marketing due to the launch of Verismo in last Q1.", "All other segments grew revenue to $159 million in Q1, up from $101 million over last Q1. And we delivered $14 million of operating income up from the $4 million loss a year ago.", "The growth in both revenue and operating income was due to the addition of Teavana which was not in our prior year Q1 results. Please note that Q1 was the last quarter, we will not have Teavana in the prior period results as it was added at the beginning of Q2 of fiscal 2013.", "Before I move on to our fiscal 2014 target, let me note that this quarter we corrected an immaterial error in our prior period financial statements to allow pretty more accurate comparison with current results.", "Specific to Q1 the impact of last year that both revenues and other operating expenses were lowered in channel development by $5.5 million and in all other segments by $0.9 million. There was no impact to the operating income. More details including the full explanation can be found on our Investor Relations website.", "On the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a conservative focus or ramping up leverage were appropriate. During the first quarter we paid in full our obligation to Kraft as a result of the other pricing outcome. This led to the issuance of $750 million of debt in December which when coupled with the $750 million we issued in September and prior issuances puts our total long-term debt at just over $2 billion. The two most recent issuances result in a meaningful increase for interest expense that is reflected in our Q1 results and that will continue.", "The rapid pace of Starbucks card loads during the first quarter has pushed our quarter ending deferred revenue balance to over $1 billion for the first time ever and 29% higher than a year ago. These loads also boost our already strong cash flow which for the quarter saw unusual decline due to the cash payment.", "The Starbucks Card strain proceeds from our recent debt issuance and strong quarterly results offset the Kraft payment however and we ended Q1 with $2.2 billion cash, cash equivalents that available for sale investment security. Our strong cash position and conservative balance sheet mean that we can continue to return cash to shareholders through dividend of share purchases.", "In the first quarter we reinitiated our share repurchase program and we continue to target share repurchases to offset dilution of our broad based stock equity program that also include our first time store partners.

With the over delivery on EPS in Q1, we\u2019re now targeting full year fiscal 2014 EPS in the range of $2.59 to $2.67, which includes $0.03 of additional interest expense as a result of recent debt issuances. That represent strong 18% to 22% growth over fiscal \u201913 when excluding last years non-recurring gain due to the sales of equity in Mexico, Chile and Argentina in the fourth quarter recording the Kraft litigation charge.", "Specific to the second quarter, we continue to expect EPS in the range of $0.54 to $0.55. Remember that traditionally, the second quarter is our lowest in terms of earnings due largely of seasonality. That means the fixed cost like our interest expense on debt issue over the past six months had a more dilutive impact on Q2 than the other quarters. Additionally, last Q2 we had a $0.03 gain on sale of equity in our Mexico business.", "With respect to the second half of the year, we\u2019re targeting Q3 EPS in the range of $0.64 to $0.66 and Q4 EPS in the range of $0.70 to $0.75. The second half of the year represents growth of approximately 20% when excluding non-routine gain and the Kraft litigation charge it reflects the strong earning momentum we\u2019ll continue to generate.", "We continue to expect a $0.09 to $0.10 whole year EPS benefits from lower coffee costs in fiscal \u201914.

And with respect to fiscal \u201915, we now have more than a quarter of our company\u2019s loss that reach stable in the fiscal \u201914.

We have a another significant growth leverage to continue the outstanding Americas performance. We have considerable momentum brewing in caf\u00e9 in EMEA. Our channel development business is taking share from competitors and delivering more of the company profitability than ever before. And our fiscal discipline and conservative balance sheet continue to serve us well. ", "What we have built over the past two years is paying dividends now. Our growth investment proposition is based on strong double digit revenue fuelled by consistent mid single digit comp growth and this is based on growing earnings that are at much faster than the top line. We achieved all of that in the first quarter and we are confident not only to continue that revenue growth, margin expansion and strong earnings growth in the quarters ahead.

Mike?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America. ", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Troy, for the current quarter, for the second quarter, one of the guidance was stepped up marketing, I believe around both [indiscernible] and the Starbucks card. Are you still \u2013 is that service you\u2019re still executing that and could you give us an update on where [indiscernible] is used now in terms of store penetration?", "Troy Alstead", "Yes, we continue to expect the same guidance we\u2019ve given you previously which is something about higher marketing spend as a percent of sales in the second quarter and frankly in Q3 and Q4 also anticipating morally higher marketing spend as we really continue investing, driving our business, supporting level launch for food broadly and driving innovation throughout our stores. So that will continue and that is also a \u2013 progress guidance to the second quarter. ", "Level launch, to be hot in terms of the lower new stores in the first quarter to largely to focus on the big holiday through the quarters. That will resume here beginning in the second quarter and we continue to expect to be fully rolled out with the first wave of this bakery program only across the U.S. by the end of fiscal year.", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "You mentioned the complexity of the level line is rolled out and really it is a huge undertaking and a major change. But has there been more complex being expected or what are the intricacies of rolling out that you discovered from your experiences?", "Troy Alstead", "No, nothing anymore complex being anticipated, a big change like this across a huge system like Mihow [ph], with the decline of transaction volumes we have per store is a big change, the big operational change, the big supply chain change and all that is anticipated and then of course a goodwill we are providing at a better experience, new experience on as the product innovations we learn as we go, we continue to fine tune labor deployments and working routines and product assortments, fortunately customers want broader products, you will see us a respond and track back as we learn from last year\u2019s launches and proceed to the rest of this year. But that\u2019s a normal part of the process. Everything \u2013 part is right on technically we expect, we are extremely pleased with the results we are seeing in terms of the uplift, the fact that fruit continues to be an incremental comp driver in our business and we think this is big an opportunity we ever had just as we continue to roll out from here.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan", "Troy, you made a mention that there might have been some slowdown in comps in December and I was just hoping in the US \u2013 just hoping you could provide a little bit more color on that? Whether it was related to core food and beverage or perhaps other items that you saw in the store, whether you think you may see any implications of that as we enter 2014?", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, John. Yes, we did see some slowing in December relative to previous quarters and relative to the early part of the quarter relative to October and November. And we really attribute that fundamentally to discussions Howard had early on in the call, which is fundamentally that significant shift in consumer behavior less retail traffic that we are all hearing about from other retailers that we are hearing about in Retail Traffic report that is published.", "Now, all that\u2019s out there has some impact on our traffic roads in December particularly. Now, as I\u2019ve said it\u2019s important to note, we still serve record numbers of customers. We had record traffic coming to our stores in December, had record sales volumes in the month of December and for the quarter overall. We continue to drive traffic, however just at a slightly slower system we had coming into that bigger month.", "Now, with that said, no comments about the particular quarter or implications beyond that other than just to point out and acknowledge what you already know is we\u2019re underscoring. The advantage we have, we expect that significant change in consumer behavior is the fact that we ended Q1 with more than a $1 billion of deferred revenue on our balance sheet. Dollars that customers have loaded on the card that will become revenue in our stores as we proceed from here, that\u2019s an important advantage that we have a leadership position and we will continue to further our leadership as we proceed from here.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan", "But maybe there is an evidence in the conference I made that 1% less than average tickets or just that maybe you sold less than some of the higher ticket, maybe gift related items outside of the card in the quarter. Is that a right comment because obviously composition of the comp is not just traffic it\u2019s also average ticket. You just had very low average ticket growth in this most recent December quarter and can you just give us a sense of what that may trend going forward especially with the addition of things like global launch and evolution and what have you?", "Howard Schultz", "", "There is no message there. In fact, I think if you look at each quarter for the last two to three years you would see our typical average 1% mini quarters, two same quarters, but more often and not within that 1% to 2% range. So you saw the first quarter coming with ticket that was sold receipts from most of our trends. That will tend to be at point or two the either way. But again that\u2019s been evidenced by most of our countries like.", "And the slowdown we saw -- the large slowdown we saw in the month of December in traffic was very broad based. It wasn\u2019t unique to any particular region. It was unique to any particular day part or product set or product line. It clearly demonstrates, improves stuffs and there was just a fewer people out there shopping and so fewer people for us to capture and provide some great experiences in our stores.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan", "Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Very much. I wanted to follow-up on that again and I guess I just have a couple of questions about the shift in the spending habits, kind of one big and one small. In terms of the small, other restaurants have pointed to weather. Can you disentangle when you look at your data, something that tells you when weather was good your comps were better or worst, I mean is there -- are there data that you can look at and say that definitively not the case, it\u2019s much more about the shopping habit?", "And the second point is in bigger picture, can you just talk about why you think we\u2019re seeing this inflection point now in terms of how people are spending and does this have any implications for Starbucks going forward. I always think of Starbucks as kind of a destination as oppose to a convenience, but its sounds like there is some pieces of business that gets hurt if there are just fewer people shopping.", "Howard Schultz", "This is Howard. Let me try and answer your questions. It is sometimes easy to kind of bifurcate what happens specifically in the quarter. It was about weather and other things, but there is no gap. Throughout the quarter, there were unusual events and don\u2019t forget we had the government shutdown, which certainly had a adverse effect on consumer confidence and consumer behavior both before and after.", "And then obviously, there was a lot of weather. But in my prepared comments I spoke specifically that I don\u2019t think that was the driving issue here. I strongly believe that the month of December and what Troy just described in terms of John\u2019s earlier question will go down as a turning point in the overall way in which people are shopping. I think, clearly, the month of December was the gift giving time and as a result of that people spent much more time on the web than ever before than you saw that in the online ecommerce sales. As a result of that on the margin, there were fairly less people out shopping and as a result of that, in certain day parts in the month of December, there weren\u2019t as many people captured. Now what Troy just said in terms of the follow up, your question in terms of going forward, I do believe that there will be a real seachange for many, many retailers who are going to have a hard time navigating through what I believe will not be December-ish problem, this is going to be an ongoing issue and it\u2019s going to have them faster than people think in terms of the way people are shopping and how they are spending their time, and the value that you can get on the web.", "Now when I mentioned in my closing comments, I believe very strongly that we have the inherent benefit built in to be able not only to capture incremental traffic but to drive traffic into our stores as a result of the things that we will be doing and the combination of physical and digital assets that will get stronger over time, I do believe that although John mentioned in his comments that both traffic and average ticket, the 4% number in Q1 to me really is the number that we have looked at as really the sign of the strength and conviction that our customers have about Starbucks. I don\u2019t know any other retailer or restaurant that drove traffic into their stores at that time and if you look at how much money we spent on consumer advertising and trying to capture customers it\u2019s is very very de minimus compared to others. ", "One thing, Troy, did leave out, that I will just mention in terms of the average ticket, we did \u2013 we were a little bit more promotional in-store during the most second half of December in terms of recognizing that there was a problem in that country with traffic and as a result of that, the average ticket problem we went down a bit as a result of promotional activities. But I would say with no defensiveness that we look at the 5% comp number and the 4% traffic number in Q1 literally a stunning success given our peer group and given the macro market conditions. I do believe that there will be challenges for many, many of the retailers in calendar \u201914 and Starbucks will be one of the companies that not only will be able to navigate through but will be market share as a result of the combination of assets that we have.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Just two questions. Just one to follow up on the La Boulange, wonder if you can give some incremental color in terms of what you are seeing in the store that already have it, whether it be mix, frequency, average check, or what can you talk about, what the contribution is to the comp or any update on the lunch rollout and then I had one follow up question. ", "Troy Alstead", "First, I would say, the role of the retailer we\u2019re probably hoping for, we\u2019re just very encouraged across all aspects of this food program. It still is a rolling in partner stores across the U.S. and it needed only the part of our new elevated food program which is basic category as you know. But all indications are we have found something that resonates service to customers, gets us a change to dramatically see their expectations around food, because it\u2019s a chance to continue to drive food as faster growing part of our business which we have been for some time and that continues to over time elevate food as a mix of the stores overall. One part that I should that, that is connected in food is that while all day parts food for us is a healthy cliff in the first quarter, mid day and afternoon outpaced growth of the other day parts and that\u2019s consistent with some recent trends and it\u2019s partially fueled by food, by people recognizing that there is a fantastic food opportunity now at Starbucks in most day than the afternoon snack items, bakery choices for all day along, they are not that it used to be.", "So every indication for us continues to be very positive. We\u2019ve got a ways to go to continue this rollout around the US. The lunch program will continue to be fine tuned and which is really that stages right now and we are very excited as that will begin rolling out late in fiscal year or early next fiscal year more broadly, we are very excited about that next wave of food. And what we have seen from is a multi year elevation of food that we think give us a tailwind in comp growth and tailwind in volumes through the stores over that same service downtime. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "And just follow on the earlier question thing that you have \u2013 it\u2019s now 13,000 plus stores around the U.S. You talked about the shift from brick-and-mortar to perhaps online which obviously you guys seem that are positioned in most to deal with that. Would you say that at this kind of the holiday timeframe, where I guess that becomes pronounced. Do you think there has been a change in the underlying health of the consumer or they're really just around shopping in the holidays and therefore there hasn\u2019t really been a change in the health of the consumer per se just the matter of how they spend or how they spend their time shopping?", "Howard Schultz", "I think we have a lens on consumer behavior and consumer spending perhaps unlike any other retailer with the national footprint we have. I would say this is in quantitative. It\u2019s more qualitative and more personal. I think the health of the consumer today is better than it was a year ago. But I do think it\u2019s still a fragile issue and what we saw with the government shutdown on October, is any isolated events of that magnitude can have a very drastic and dramatic effect on behavior and I think that's speaks to the fragility.", "", "Now having said all that, I think one of the underlying benefits of Starbucks for many, many years is that we are an affordable luxury. We have been -- we continue to be that. And as a result of that the demography and broad-based diversification of our customer base and our store base insulates us from some of the underlying problems and may exist in one geography versus another.", "I also think what Troy said is that our ability to take the fiscal asset of Starbucks and our fixed costs. If you look at store today versus even three years ago, the ability with La Boulange, carbonation coming and thing that we're going to do with tea are going to extend the date, leverage our fixed costs and give us incrementality, not only on the introduction of certain products. But many of these things are linked to the opportunity to increase food attachment not as a result only of La Boulange with the beverage and the innovation that we're bringing that are skewed towards that.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Helpful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs", "I wanted to follow-up on La Boulange a bit further and there are two questions. The first are you able to rule out the possibility that any of the same-store sales slowdown may have been associated with reduce throughout during the peak sales quarter as a result of the complexities in the store associated with La Boulange?", "And then the second is, can you talk to us about what you expect as it relates to hot breakfast and hot lunch that are coming next under the platform. And how far are you able to go with respect to product offerings, how it's going to be managed logistically at the stores et cetera?", "Troy Alstead", "Yeah let me speak to the first thing Michael and Howard may want to jump in here too. There is absolutely nothing -- nothing whatsoever to the idea that -- what\u2019s happening with our food programs and La Boulange rule out is impacting throughout or is impacting service in the stores or have any thing to do with comp growth, still down in the quarter, absolutely nothing. We can completely rule that out. We have an opportunity and analysis to look at stores with La Boulange and stores without La Boulange.", "I appreciate you don't get to see that side-by-side set of analytics that I do. There is no change in our key transaction day part, there is no impact we think to discern from that. Now perhaps in -- we\u2019ll appreciate this. I think sometime there is a customer perception that things are different in stores, food is being warmed out, multiple order in food, the case looks different.", "That change requires some adoption overtime. And I think that it may have created some case\u2019s perception, but you could find out in the rule out, if there is any meaningful impact on what\u2019s happening there. And at the same time, we\u2019ll continue to deploy more labor and revise the labor routines against food that grows in our stores. We'll make sure we\u2019re best in right parts of our business to both dry volumes, to meet the customer needs and to grow profitability on our stores as time goes on.", "Howard Schultz", "If you cry, one thing about that. Not only it's absolutely nothing to suggest that there is a throughput issue, but I would also remind you that because of the Starbucks card and the quick adoption of mobile payment that we are speeding up the level of service and our stores. And when you look at the amount of people that are now paying with the card and with the unbelievable rate of adoption and how accretive global payment is -- there is no issue whatsoever. This is a myth that absolutely has no legs and for all of you listing on the call, you should just eradicate that it does not exist.", "Now Michael, with respect to your second question, I have only some surprises out there. I\u2019ll tell you we've got some great new innovations coming both in that morning category around the savory items and warm items, as well as in lunch. Everything we have seen so far encourages us that we just beginning to go after where is there big, big good opportunity, both in our busy day part to drive increase the cash.", "But also as I said before, it continues food as we have (inaudible) into lunch program and mid-day as an attached as we rolled out the carbonated beverage platform later December, all these things work together. Of course, we know the food as an elevated quality in our stores not only drive our food sales but by the way it drives higher beverage sale as when people come in they buy food, they also buy beverage. So the whole shift rise the level of earnings in stores and that whole product pipeline tend to increase as we find ourselves all that include. So more to come, more details, but I think you really like the food we have coming out balance of the year.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Buckingham Research.", "Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research", "Thank you. I just wanted a little clarification and then a question with respect to the promotion? You mentioned that for promotional side of the business, you may have impacted the average check in the most recent quarter reported. Should we read into that then in a environment where you have $1.4 billion worth of pent-up demand call it that we would probably not see as much promotional activity?", "And then, just, I just want to clarify, when you keep referring to sort of the change in overall retail, doing more online sales in the brick and mortar guys softness, historically shopping happens on the weekend? So would we read into that then you anecdotal -- you literally saw then tangible evidence that the business that might have been correlated with brick and mortar traffic associate with weekend business was your weakness in December because you said pretty much that it wasn\u2019t day part position or timing of the day or timing of the week I run into that?", "Howard Schultz", "I think the latter which is no evidence with specificity that there was a weekness issue. So I think this was to spread across multiple days. One thing about the issue of weather that was brought up earlier, currently any weather problem in the city where people are living and enjoying the Christmas holiday season. The initial reaction was not wow and so the weather plays I think a positive roll for the online ecommerce opportunities because it was so convenient.", "But we did not see a weekend issue and I think one thing I want to go back to is we anticipated this level of change. The investments we made in the car, the investments we made in mobile payment, all these things were in anticipation of what we saw in December. They probably came at us and everybody else that they faster clip. But we were in a position to take advantage of in the best evidence of that not only $1.4 billion but the $200 million, it\u2019s sitting in the reloads.", "And that\u2019s just underscored product, however at this point, they are in holiday period in past years. We would see elevated holiday traffic always long, not finding, just isolated to the weekends. So I think that underscores the fact that because we didn\u2019t see it isolated to the weekend this time that does not message anything else other than that. It actually very closely matches, how we would anticipate that traffic around the holiday. And then perhaps you can help me understand your first question, were you saying that related to promotional discount that we increased a bit in the first quarter because we have Starbucks card balances, are you asking if that means it will be lesser going forward.", "Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research", "Correct. So I\u2019m assuming that you had, you addressed December slowdown with promotional activity that given the pent-up demand you probably would be correct to assume that you would not need to do as much promotional activity and its adverse effect of the check?", "Howard Schultz", "Let me speak specifically on this and whether we need to do promotions or not. We can see this throughout the year at various times at various offers, particularly around now striving to get the Starbucks card balances loaded and registered so that they become an integral part of our loyalty program.", "So you will see us very active in what we do. It may not be as specific around merchandised promotions as we did in the holiday period that for us is true. But it should continue to very actively to engage customer and keep traffic coming into our stores at each quarters to go.", "Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. First a follow-up, Troy, what are the metrics around card usage in January, what portion of the cards are used in January and if you know this, what portion of those are actually used by first time customers, people that haven\u2019t registered before. That\u2019s the follow up.", "I also just want to ask about EMEA. We haven\u2019t talked about any places around the world? What was the inflection point, what country or what was the piece that really changed the comp momentum. I think, for the first time in awhile that -- in that segment?", "Howard Schultz", "John, to the first question, in years past, most of that incremental new card load tends to come into the stores predominantly in second quarter but then also continuing into the third quarter.", "So going into this quarter, I won\u2019t make any specific comments about what we are seeing in the current quarter right now, we are in the current month of January. We would anticipate that we would see that incremental load coming through the business as we progress through Q2 and even in the Q3 that would matched more of the typical historical pattern.", "Now in EMEA, there has been a very meaningful steady progress. I would say, I think, the first quarter was perhaps a bit of an inflection point as a number of great things came together all at once for us. But to be clear, these are all the things we have been working in our team over in EMEA has been working on for two years now around dynamic -- achieve dynamically changing the stores experience around beverage preparation, execution within in-stores around the licensing activity, all of that, all of that, really starting to shift both in the topline now and in the middle of P&L driving that margin to the all time high that we reported in Q1.", "So it\u2019s a bit of an inflection point but its one that comes after several quarters in a row preparation and a lot of hard work. We would absolutely anticipate that improvement continues, not always at the pace that we have experience in the first quarter, just to be clear. But everything we have been saying for the last two years, we believe we can continue to develop EMEA into the very, very health strong contributor in our business, I think Q1 is a fantastic validation of that.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Is it just suffice to say that is it U.K. largely U.K. driven or is it some stronger performance around the peripheral that market is not as strong as the average?", "Howard Schultz", "No. On contrary U.K. was very strong for us, but it also broad base, so all of our major markets in EMEA company-owned U.K., France, Germany, Switzerland, we saw nice improvement prospect portfolio of markets. But the U.K was perhaps leading, we have very good quarter in U.K.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Regarding channel development, you mentioned some coffee innovation in your remarks, but you build up a stable of brands outside of coffee, for instance I suspect internal you would have big dreams brands like Evolution Fresh and where that can go? I just wanted to get a sense of those dreams and maybe just a timing about, will there be a big push beyond coffee with channel development, one of these quarters will sort of wake and you will be pushing harder and marketing more than you ever had before? Thanks.", "Howard Schultz", "Thanks Dave. The answer is yes. We have big aspirations for what more we can do through our standalone/ business. Particularly as we have acquired and driving our stores and really began to nurturing and integrate these new brands and businesses we have.", "Now I won\u2019t have you expect any meaningful change in any immediate quarter right in front of us, but we are progressing with the rollout of Evolution Fresh across the country, sold within the Starbucks stores but as we go building up that distribution into the CPG channel that will continue.", "We have big aspirations for what we can do with Teavana in this channel with all the business in time, first priority for Teavana though is our standalone Teavana business, as well as bringing those pieces into Starbucks business. But in time as we build equities of Teavana, as we develop the following around Evolution Fresh all of these products have great opportunity within the extended into the channel development business. And really leverage on top of the infrastructure we have, the relationships and trade we have, the distribution that we built, so you will actually see us build more overtime in that space.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason West with Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah. Just going back to the discussion around the shift in the consumer over the holidays? I am just wondering if you guys have past through the store base and if you have identified maybe a percentage of the store base that would be more exposed to that shift, if you could talk about what that number might be and are there different things that you are going to do in those stores that are little more retail oriented to kind of address this issue or is it really sort of the chain-wide effort that\u2019s going to be addressing this?", "Howard Schultz", "I would say that the any bricks and mortar company that is heavily skewed to malls will be more susceptible to this new change. I think we are in a unique position in that. Our mall based business is a very small component of our overall national footprint. So I don\u2019t think that you are going to see us be at a disadvantage because of our real estate portfolio. I think we introduced this subject to you, not to create fear and trepidation but willing to share with you what we believe to be a new dynamic change in consumer behavior. But linked to that once again, it\u2019s our strong belief that not only did we anticipate this but we have the resources, the capabilities and the assets unlike most traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers to be a beneficiary of this change.", "And I think once again the Starbucks card platform and the Starbucks mobile card -- mobile transaction platform is still in its nascent stage. And we believe there is an opportunity to extend that value to our customers in ways that we have not yet shared with you. And we also think there is an opportunity overtime to take full advantage of what every other tech company is chasing with regard to mobile payments.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Just a quick follow-up on that, I mean the mobile ordering you guys alluded to in the past, is it something that would be sort of early stage or I guess, earlier in the pipeline to kind of be of pre-orders with your phone before you get to the store, just wondering that\u2019s something that\u2019s coming soon?", "Howard Schultz", "I\u2019m not going to explain with specificity of when that is coming. But I can tell you that we understand the value that that will create for our customer base and also we believe is significant incrementality as a result of it. And if you look at how quick we were and how early we were to adopt mobile payment in our stores, you can assume that over time we will meet in this area.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.", "Andy Barish - Jefferies", "Hi guys. On a margin question in the Americas, obviously the performance in the first quarter was fantastic but regard to the rest of the year, it\u2019s sort of moderate increases which implies kind of flattening of margin, maybe even, some challenges in the two key to maintain margins with some of the investment marketing spend you spoke about, Troy. Can you give us a little help directionally there for the rest of the year on America\u2019s margins?", "Troy Alstead", "Yeah, Andy. No absolutely not. We would anticipate the balance of the year to be able to moderately expand the margin in Americas. Now the first quarter was more than -- actually more than I would say it\u2019s moderate. Remember that was fueled by some unusual events from a year ago, like the leadership conference as an example. Like Superstorm Sandy certainly had impact on us as it did all of the retailers. So the degree of expansion, life won\u2019t be as high but balance of the year has it -- wasn\u2019t that first quarter where we had every expectation to continue to roll the top line and improve possibility to our store system.", "Andy Barish - Jefferies", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Keith Siegner with UBS. Your line is open.", "Keith Siegner - UBS", "Thanks. I just want to follow-up on some of the comments related to the promotional activity in December. If you take it out, this is a uniquely Starbucks\u2019 capability to leverage the dramatic increases in the amount of customers in the social and mobile and digital. Has that usage picked up? How has this advantage may have picked up. In other words like how quickly can you respond to these things. How customizable or personalized can you take initiatives and that you have so many more customers on this program. Does the uptick change or uptick change from what you would have seen in years passed. Some color on that would very\u2026", "Howard Schultz", "Thanks Keith. Let me ask Adam Brotman, our Chief Digital Officer to respond to them.", "Adam Brotman", "Hi Keith. It\u2019s a great question. And the answer is absolutely, we\u2019ve never been more nimble in terms of our ability to respond using our digital assets. We saw that this -- I mean, the holiday period, where we\u2019re able to react. A very personalized level, even some geo-targeted aspects of what we\u2019re doing and it is significant improvement over where were in the same quarter last year. And it speaks to the number of customer participating not only in My Starbucks Rewards but on the mobile platforms. This puts in a great position to be even more nimble as we go forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens. Your line is open.", "Will Slabaugh - Stephens", "I think just a quick follow-up on Europe, a nice surprise there. I was wondering if you could break down sort of where you feel like you\u2019re winning right now, where you turned that inflection point where there still an opportunity. And then secondarily, are you seeing a difference in your company owned traditional stores versus performance in some of the license with a more captive audience.", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks. Well, our license business has been a healthier component of our business in EMEA for quite sometime. We frankly struggled more over the last handful of years in our company operated business. Now as I look at the first fiscal quarter and break it down price little bit, what\u2019s very encouraging to me is that the revenue growth we saw and the trajectory change we saw was almost evenly split between the licensed business and company operated comp growth driven.", "The licensees have tipped a little bit stronger but not much. Both were very strong contributors to the increasing revenue and were built around profitability. And that\u2019s two messages there. One is the significant focus we\u2019ve had on store execution and operations, on management of the stores, on supply chain into the stores. All of that has been a heavy focus of ours as you\u2019ve been hearing us talk about for a couple years now and that\u2019s paying off. Absolutely, fundamentally, we are seeing topline response. We are seeing customers respond and bottom lines improving.", "We also -- now, as we really being to mature and flush out our licensed strategy to the region, we understand much better today what component of that region should have the licensed execution as it would have accelerated that. And even over the last year and a half, we converted and sold off some former company operated stores to licensees as we made that transition that has contributed nicely and of course that has a higher margin execution. It gets us back towards the customers to your point that we couldn\u2019t have a lot easier.", "And in some cases it positions the licensee to better able to operate in a particular geography of venue that we are in currently. So both of those things are progressing and I will have to say I think we are winning right now, both in company operated and in licensed part of our business there.", "Will Slabaugh - Stephens", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird", "Hi. Good afternoon. My question is on the new store development within the U.S. And it sounds like you are seeing some very good results from some of your, the newer class of openings and you mentioned there was opportunity or wide space related to drive through. So, I\u2019m just wondering if all of that is giving you more confidence and maybe stepping up the unit growth rate as you look out to maybe 2015 or \u201916 or beyond. Is this maybe a precursor for accelerating the growth?", "Howard Schultz", "Maybe I answered that. I spoke about drive throughs and I spoke about the $1.2 million for new stores. In addition to that, we\u2019ve had unusual success in very unique configurations and store types. Many of you probably got red that we\u2019ve opened up about four, five stores that are literally old containers and they are drive-through only and walk up.", "So volumes on those stores against the cost to build them are -- it has given us great confidence than you have unusual opportunity in traditional stores, drive throughs and what I just previously described as unique configurations both in size and location. We\u2019ve also done a lot of work on verticals, for example hospitals, where we do not have a lot of penetration.", "So, I would say that you probably will se us go after a significant build of additional market share in the future with an acceleration of U.S. stores that are highly targeted against the return on investment and the sales that we are currently achieving in the kind of stores that we have not opened before.", "And in addition to that you will certainly see traditional several stores around the country. But I think that despite commentary on key change in customer behavior that we have underestimated for the last two, three years, the opportunity that we have across North America for additional stores and specifically additional store types meeting with directors.", "There is no job to drive through, has surprised all of us in terms of its volume, return on investment and the opportunity to build stores that we didn\u2019t think existed in the past and you will see us do that in great numbers in the future, coupled with what I\u2019ve just described.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA.", "Diane Geissler - CLSA", "Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the mobile payments in China. I think it is fair to say that smartphone technology has vastly improved from when you launched this program in the U.S. But even if we look at the U.S. as sort of examples, the early years where you saw card loads certainly in the 70%, 80%, 90% range and now they\u2019ve sort of stabilized in the 30%, 40% range? Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for China? I mean the China consumer have embraced smartphone technologies. So I think the market is bright for the launch of this type of platform? But maybe you could give a little bit of more detail about what you plan there, how it will differ from what we see in the U.S.? And then your expectation sort of how you are going to measure yourself in is it heading your goals or not? If you could give us some details around that, I would really appreciate it? Thank you.", "Howard Schultz", "I mean, I think, Adam, is going to answer that question. I will -- I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m -- I think we\u2019re all sitting here in surprise that we haven\u2019t done one question with regard to the biggest opportunity in front of us in terms of geography about China and market that we have over thousand stores are best performing market outside of the U.S., you are talking about wide space, its uncharged with opportunity. Adam go ahead?", "Adam Brotman", "Yeah. Diane, it is a great question and the answer is, absolutely we believe the opportunity for mobile payments is something that we\u2019ll spend not limited China but frankly there are many markets around the globe. We have already bought it to all of ten markets and China we believe will be no exception, highly technologically savvy, consumer base, one where they were talk about MSR offering and growth and we believe that China will be a great opportunities to do the kinds of things there then we are trying here in terms of mobile payment, mobile royalty, innovation of the store. So, yes, I can\u2019t get any specific but that\u2019s coming soon.", "Howard Schultz", "John, go ahead.", "John Culver", "Yeah. Diane, this is John Culver. With regards to just add on to what Adam is saying. Two years ago we launched the Starbucks rewards program in China and in that short period of time we now have nearly 4 million members on the platform. And to Adam\u2019s point, we are laying the rails right now for a much more accelerated digital experience for our customers in China.", "We just launched some in concert this Chinese New Year, the first ever store value gift card in our stores in China. And then, obviously, continue to rollout the opportunity as it relates to Starbucks app on both the iPhone, as well as the Android application. So a big opportunity for us to take what we\u2019ve done in U.S., transfer that knowledge and capability into China and look at a whole new way of reinventing the experience for our customers there.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "", "Mike, we have the time for one last question today, please?", "Operator", "The last question comes from Karen Holthouse with Credit Suisse.", "Karen Holthouse - Credit Suisse", "Hi. Another quick question on the drive throughs. This is something that\u2019s been talked about more on the last couple of calls and I\u2019m just curious for units have already have them. Is there an opportunity to really go into those units and optimize throughput, find better ways to ensure order accuracy and if so, what\u2019s the opportunity for that and what\u2019s the timeline for addressing it? Thanks.", "Howard Schultz", "", "Thanks, Karen. The answer to that is absolutely yes. One of the things that we fundamentally know is that in our drive throughs, not only do we have huge opportunities for more directors around U.S. The economics are strong, they have -- as we said in past quarters cost higher than our full portfolio including the non drive-through starts.", "So we see every great indication of drive throughs and including by the way to improve throughput to up-level the experience for the customers as they come through, to change how our mix engages with the customer in that line, help move that deck of cards more quickly.", "We have significant work underway to do exactly that. And part of that by the way includes enhanced technologies. Some of the same things you\u2019ve heard us talk about we would see it innovate around in terms of payment and ordering into cafe, inside the store will be very through and very beneficial in the drive through. So much more to come but we will go back to all of our existing drive through of this mix enhancements today. I\u2019m quite confident there will be incremental drivers to our business.", "Karen Holthouse - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you, Karen. That concludes our earnings call for today. Thank you all for joining us. We will talk to you again next quarter.

I'll now turn the call over to your host, Ms. DeGrande. Madam, you may begin.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations of Starbucks Coffee Company. Joining me on the call today from New York is Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; and here with me in Seattle is Troy Alstead, CFO.", "Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements.

Howard?", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn, and good afternoon, everyone. I am delighted to report the record third quarter results that Starbucks announced today. Our third quarter results reflect the underlying strength and continuing momentum Starbucks has been experiencing across all of our global business segments. Never before in our 40-year history has Starbucks been healthier, more deeply connected to our customers and partners or better positioned to go after the tremendous business opportunities around the world that lie ahead.", "Our third quarter results also reflect the success of our efforts and investments to innovate and deliver the exciting new beverage and food products and formats to our customers around the world and to elevate the Starbucks Experience everywhere we do business. And the results are just beginning to demonstrate the power and extraordinary global potential of the unique blueprint for growth business model we unveiled last December. ", "The very solid increase in global store traffic we experienced in Q3, despite significant economic uncertainty in many of the markets in which we operate, encourages us that our efforts and investments are resonating with our customers and will enable us to build long-term value for our shareholders.", "Today, I will share highlights of our Q3 performance and discuss a few accomplishments and developments that will not be evident from the figures alone. Then I'll turn the call over to Troy who will take you through the financials and introduce our fiscal 2012 targets.", "In Q3, Starbucks delivered another quarter of record revenue, operating income and earnings per share. Our consolidated revenues totaled $2.9 billion, up 12% over last year, driven largely by an 8% increase in global comp store sales. We delivered earnings of $0.36 per share, up 33% over last year. Our Q3 results were made possible by the passion, focus and energy of our nearly 200,000 Starbucks partners in 55 countries around the world, and are particularly gratifying in that they were delivered in the face of formidable challenges and economic headwinds that continue to confront all global retailers today.  Strong top line growth, combined with continued discipline around controlling costs throughout the organization, helped mitigate commodity costs that while having abated somewhat recently, remained stubbornly high during much of the quarter.", "Beyond our record financial performance in Q3, we made solid progress against several other initiatives, among which we were -- among which I'd like to share with you. Making several important investments in China to advance our goal of having 1,500 stores operating in China by 2015, including acquiring full ownership of the joint venture that operates our stores in Central, South and Western China. We now own and operate all Starbucks stores in mainland China, with the exception of stores in the Shanghai market, where we continue to operate with a JV partner. Announcing our intent to form a joint venture with one of China's most established coffee operators and agricultural companies to purchase and export high-quality Arabica beans from the Yunnan province in addition to operating dry mills. This will ultimately create significant local relevance with the Chinese consumer, which we consider to be key to long-term success in China. ", "Acquiring full ownership of the JV that operates Starbucks stores in Switzerland and Austria and a transaction that will enable us to further leverage our existing company-owned markets in the U.K., Germany and France.  Extending personalized Frappuccino to our entire global store footprint all over the world enabled us to build on the learning and tremendous success of last year's U.S. and Canada launches. Continuing to roll out existing new store designs around the world, including recent openings at Harvard Square in Boston, the Brewery Blocks in Portland Oregon, Brompton Road across the street from Harrods in Central London and our Opera Store in Paris to name a few, all of which have been met with fantastic customer and media response.", "Further strengthening our industry-leading U.S. mobile payment program by launching an Android app and expanding our iPhone app to include mobile eGifting.", "As we look to the future, I could not be more excited about the new organizational and leadership structure we announced on July 11. We are significantly more confident than ever about the new structure that positions us to reach our goals. The significant operating improvements we have implemented throughout the organization have contributed to our strong financial performance and positioning us to go hard, to go fast after the tremendous global growth opportunities that lie ahead. The new structure will enable us to accelerate our global, multibrand, multichannel strategy, and to leverage the great talent and deep experience and expertise resonant in our senior leadership team.  ", "In moving to a new 3-region global structure, we are matching our best talents to our biggest opportunities around the world. In this new structure, one president will oversee all operations within each of the 3 distinct regions with responsibility for the performance of company-operated stores as well as working with license and JV partners in each market with their respective region. The region president will also be responsible for working with Starbucks Global Consumer Products Group and Foodservice teams to further develop those businesses and execute against our blueprint for growth within that region. I am very confident that this new structure will enable us to maximize our speed, efficiency and ultimately our success as we move ahead all over the world. I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with the 3 new regional presidents, John Culver for China and Asia Pacific; Cliff Burrows for the Americas and Michelle Gass for the EMEA, all of whom will be reporting directly to me.", "As President of Starbucks Coffee International over the past 2 years, John Culver and his team have delivered strong international growth, operating margins and profitability, while at the same time building a solid foundation from which we can pursue profitable growth. Thanks to John and his team, our international business has never been healthier than it is today. Our international leadership team has never been stronger. Our relationships with our international JV partners have never been more collaborative, and our store portfolio has never been healthier. We are grateful to John for putting us on a fast track towards achieving our stated long-term goal of one day having our international business rival the size and profitability of our U.S. business.", "Turning to our U.S. business. U.S. company-operated revenues in Q3 was strong, driven by continued momentum around our 40th anniversary campaign, early summer promotions, including personalized Frappuccino beverages, our new line of Starbucks Petites, 3-region blend holding coffee, and our wildly popular Frappuccino Happy Hour. Our customers continue to embrace Starbucks Reserve and our offering of Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee has almost sold out at $30 a 0.5 pound. Our exciting new store designs and remodels are driving both additional traffic and incremental sales. And at the same time, ongoing efforts to elevate our customer experience has customers reporting that we are delivering improved product quality, product taste and speed of service.", "Our Starbucks Card and loyalty program had a record quarter in Q3, activating nearly 150,000 cards per day during the quarter and generating a 38% increase in dollars loaded onto cards over this period. Starbucks continues to offer one of the largest mobile payment retailer networks in the U.S., and our network is growing. We currently have a presence in nearly 8,000 stores, including approximately 6,800 Starbucks company-operated stores, 1,000 Target stores, and we expect to complete the rollout of over 1,000 Safeway stores by the end of 2011.", "In Q3, we responded to customer demand for increasingly faster ways to pay for Starbucks purchases by introducing a Starbucks app for Android devices, enabling Android users to load money on their devices' speed transactions and manage their Starbucks Cards more effectively. We also introduced mobile gifting on our new Starbucks for iPhone app, enabling iPhone customers to send a Starbucks Card eGift to anyone for the purchase of their favorite Starbucks product. There are now 1 million mobile devices with more than $50 million loaded for use specifically at Starbucks, and reloads are tracking well ahead of plan. Our research shows that mobile payment drives store traffic and also increases speed of service. I'm pleased to report that our innovation pipeline is robust, and we are seeing significant benefits from the investments we're making in mobile payment technology.", "Looking ahead, the new Americas region, which will include the United States, Canada and Latin America, will continue to be a cornerstone of Starbucks growth. Brazil, in particular, is significantly understored and presents a solid long-term growth opportunity. I'm looking forward to the leadership and the discipline that Cliff will bring to the business as he accelerates the introduction of Starbucks Experience to coffee-loving customers throughout the region, just as he and his leadership team did in the United States.", "Turning to International. With over 800 stores in greater China and over 450 on the mainland, China remains a focal point and key market in our international growth strategy. I'm pleased to report that our performance in China in Q3 continued the recent trend of very strong comp growth and profitability. I'm also pleased to report that we remain on track to open our first store in India in 2012, and our business in Japan continues to recover nicely ahead of plan.", "Looking to Europe, as I mentioned earlier, we have acquired full ownership of our retail store operations in Switzerland and Austria, and both are now company-operated markets. This investment will help us further leverage our existing company-owned infrastructures in the U.K., Germany and France. We are grateful to the Marinopolous Group, our JV partner in these markets, for their partnership in bringing the Starbucks Experience to customers in Switzerland and Austria over the last 8 years, and look forward to continuing our collaboration with them as our valued partner in operating stores increase Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania. ", "Turning to our Consumer Products Group. We continued to invest and make major gains against our plans to build the leadership and capabilities of our CPG organization. Going forward, our global, multibrand, multichannel CPG strategy will build out a portfolio of branded business units beyond the Starbucks retail brand. Jeff Hansberry and the CPG team have now successfully transitioned the Starbucks packaged coffee and tea business in-house, and the result has been strong product distribution of packaged coffee exceeding 90% ACV in the food, drug mass channel.  Jeff and his team have also been working on integrating our packaged coffee business with our other premium single-cup platforms.", "Our portfolio now includes Starbucks packaged coffee; the very successful introduction and now ongoing business of Starbucks VIA; and coming this fall in time for the holidays, Starbucks K-Cups.  Our K-Cup launch plan calls for us to initially focus our sales efforts on food, drug and mass channels. We plan to make K-Cups available in our retail stores starting in late 2012, reflecting our commitment to a targeted CPG launch, focused on building awareness distribution and significant market share. We are encouraged by the solid support and response we've received from our customers, and expect to create both strong awareness and adoption of Starbucks K-Cups at the launch.", "VIA continues to perform very well in key markets around the world, with sales driven in part by strong summer sales of Starbucks Iced VIA. VIA is now available in more than 70,000 locations, including Starbucks stores and in CPG channels globally. VIA continues to have both strong appeal and a strong repeat rate, with trial driving sales activity. This fall, we will extend the VIA brand with 2 new SKUs, Breakfast Blend and House Blend, 2 of our top selling ground coffees, which we are confident will extend the appeal of the platform to an even broader consumer audience.", "With regard to SBC, Seattle's Best Coffee, over the past 2 years Michelle Gass and her teams have done an extraordinary job of laying the foundation and sparking Seattle's Best Coffee momentum. There are now 50,000 places to find a brewed cup of Seattle's Best Coffee, and the groundbreaking level system is seeing great success with consumers and top retailers. In fact, the Level System was recently recognized as an editor's pick by Progressive Grocer, one of the CPG industry's most respected trade publications. And the team continues to innovate around new retail store concepts, some of which are currently piloting in Canada. Given the adjacency of our CPG Foodservice and Seattle's Best business, Jeff Hansberry's new roles as President of Seattle's Best, in addition to his role as President of Global Consumer Products Groups and Foodservice, is a natural fit. We remain as committed as ever to building Seattle's Best as an independent brand with billion-dollar aspirations.", "I'd now like to talk to you about Tazo Tea. Since acquiring Tazo Tea in 1999, we have built a profitable tea business, generating more than $1 billion in system-wide sales through sales of tea in our stores as well in -- as well as in CPG and Foodservice channels. Tea is nearly a $90 billion global market opportunity and after water, the second most consumed beverage on earth. And we have exciting plans to leverage our global retail store footprint and growing CPG presence to go after the tea category in a way we've never gone after before. We are fortunate to have the ideal professional to lead this business, Annie Young-Scrivner, currently our Global Chief Marketing Officer, who will be adding the title of President of Tazo, reflecting our commitment to transforming Tazo into a globally recognized multibillion tea brand.", "In closing, Starbucks' performance over the last 2 years has been extraordinary and speaks to the commitment, tenacity and dedication of our partners around the world, who work hard in taking care of our customers and bringing the Starbucks Experience to life millions of times a day everyday. Our partners have put us in a position to go after the global, multibrand, multichannel opportunities that lie ahead. And our leadership team and our new organizational structure puts us in a position to win and win big. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Troy.", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. The exceptional results that we reported today for our fiscal third quarter are a testament to the strength of the Starbucks brand, to the depth of the company's organizational capabilities and to the dedication of our partners around the world. Once again, we set third quarter record for several key metrics, including consolidated revenue, operating income, operating margin and earnings per share.  All 3 reporting segments, the U.S, international and CPG, posted strong revenue and operating income growth. Our business has performed exceptionally well this year. And the third quarter continued that trend, despite significant headwinds from commodity costs and still challenging consumer environments in the U.S. and many other markets in which we operate. The foundation is in place to continue to aggressively pursue our aspirations to create a unique, multichannel, multibrand global consumer company. ", "Today, I'll provide additional details on our fiscal third quarter performance, then, I will update you on our expectations for the fourth quarter, as well as our initial outlook for fiscal 2012. ", "Third quarter revenues totaled $2.9 billion, up 12% from $2.6 billion a year ago. The revenue increase was primarily driven by an 8% increase in comparable store sales, attributable to 6% increase in traffic and a 2% increase in average ticket. Foreign exchange rates and higher CPG revenues also contributed to the increase.", "We reported consolidated operating income of $402 million in the third quarter, a 23% increase compared to third quarter of fiscal 2010 operating income of $328 million, and a 16% increase compared to last year's non-GAAP operating income of $348 million. Consolidated operating margin reached 13.7%, a 120 basis point improvement compared to last year's third quarter on a GAAP basis and 40 basis points on a non-GAAP basis. Increased sales leverage in the absence of restructuring charges primarily drove the improvement, partially offset by higher commodity costs.", "Earnings per share totaled $0.36 for the third quarter, compared to $0.27 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.29 per share on a non-GAAP basis in last year's fiscal third quarter. We absorbed $0.07 per share in the quarter, equivalent to 280 basis points of operating margin due to higher commodity costs compared to last year. Most of the commodity pressure was related to coffee, though dairy, cocoa and sugar and fuel also contributed. Overall, our global retail business continues to gain momentum, generating broad-based sales and income growth, while we continue to invest in our CPG business and execute on the strategy we've crafted for this important channel.", "I will now move to the result of our operating segments, which will be compared with last year's non-GAAP results. Total U.S. net revenues for the quarter were $2 billion, a 9% increase over the same period last year. Company-operated store revenues increased 8% to $1.9 billion in the quarter, due to an 8% increase in comparable store sales. The comp increase was composed of a 6% increase in transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket. The increase in average ticket was driven by pricing and food, as our Petites platform and the expansion of our warming program drove incremental attachment. This increase was partially offset by increased discounts to support loyalty and other promotional activities.", "Of note, the 2-year comp sales growth of 17% is the highest in over 5 years. And this quarter marked the first time that average daily transactions per store eclipsed our 2006 levels, previously the highest year on record. This achievement speaks to the incredible health of our U.S. business and to the improvement in our operations, when you consider that we're servicing this increased volume while holding customer satisfaction at consistently high levels. ", "Operating income for the U.S. segment was $379 million, an increase of 22% compared to the same quarter of last year. Operating margin improved 210 basis points from last year to a third quarter record of 18.8%. The margin improvement was primarily driven by sales leverage, partially offset by higher commodity costs, which negatively impacted U.S. operating margin by roughly 200 basis points.", "The U.S. segment has been performing extraordinarily well, following our transformation of the business over the past few years. A variety of initiatives have contributed to this performance, including our extremely popular loyalty program, innovative products such as our Petites platform and personalized Frappuccino, and improved supply chain and store operations that are built on Lean principles. The consistently the strong performance of the U.S. business is even more impressive, when considered in light of the still-fragile consumer environment and the inflationary headwinds brought on by a spike in commodity prices. ", "We are encouraged by the broad-based momentum of the business and energized by the opportunities that still exist. New stores are performing well ahead of expectations signaling opportunities for deeper penetration in certain areas of the country. Operationally, we have yet to take full advantage of new technologies such as our new point-of-sale system or our new inventory management system, as we're still coming up the learning curve with these tools.", "From a marketing perspective, we're in the very early stages of leveraging our unique digital capabilities to engage with our very loyal customer base, with programs such as eGifting and personalized one-to-one marketing having the potential to drive additional traffic into our stores. We are also doing a great deal of work in the areas of store design and store segmentation to understand how our customers use our stores and to optimize each store's particular real estate to enhance the overall experience. While we are at or above peak levels in the U.S. by many measures, these initiatives, as well as others, give us confidence that there are still significant untapped potential to grow revenues and profit in our core business, while we pursue emerging opportunities internationally and in CPG.", "Moving now to results from our International segment. International total net revenues increased 20% to $659 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, an all-time quarterly record. The increase was driven by foreign exchange rates, comparable store sales growth of 5% and new store growth. The comp growth was driven by a 4% increase in traffic and a 1% increase in average ticket. Continuing the trend we've seen throughout the year, China contributed a significant portion to the overall comp growth to this segment. Comps in China accelerated this quarter to a level in the mid-30s from an already impressive trend earlier this year in the mid-20s.", "Similar to the U.S. and Canada launches last year, this quarter, we launched the personalized frappuccinos across the balance of International store portfolio. Initial response in many markets has been exceptionally strong, particularly in our warm-weather markets where our Frappuccino business tends to be a larger share of the retail product mix. Overall, we saw strong comp growth in most of our emerging company-operated markets, which bodes well for the future, as these markets are key components to our long-term growth ambitions outside of the U.S.", "International operating income was $80 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, a 35% increase compared to last year and a third quarter record for International. Operating margin improved by 140 basis points to 12.2%, primarily driven by sales leverage and lower impairment charges, partially offset by higher commodity costs. Increased commodity costs in the quarter impacted International operating margin by roughly 150 basis points. This is the highest third quarter operating margin on record for the International segment and continues the progression that started last year for the long-term target of mid- to high-teens operating margin outside the U.S.", "Building on Howard's earlier comments, during the quarter, we announced the acquisition of the remaining equity in the Central, South and West regions of China, where we previously had a minority partner. With this acquisition, we now own 100% of operations in mainland China, with the exception of the Shanghai market where we have a very strong joint venture partnership. This ownership change aligns with our strategy to accelerate growth in China on the way to our stated goal of having more than 1,500 stores by 2015. The recent performance we've seen in this important market, extremely high comp growth, the most profitable stores in any market around the world and strong new store return on investment suggest that we're hitting a point where the brand is getting critical mass and the consumer appetite for Starbucks presents huge potential.", "In addition to the shift in ownership in mainland China, today we announced we increased our ownership in the Switzerland and Austrian markets to 100%. We will leverage our existing infrastructure to integrate these markets into our Western European company-operated portfolio.", "Collectively, our International portfolio has never been in better health, and our vision of a diverse mix of profit contributors across the globe is beginning to materialize. We're starting to see a more balanced contribution from the entire portfolio. In addition to China's rapid growth, our licensed markets, many of which are smaller emerging markets, collectively are growing revenues at a faster rate than our company-owned markets as a result of both comp and new store growth. ", "The International team has done an incredible job in setting up the foundation for success outside the U.S. And as we move into the previously announced regional structure in fiscal 2012, I'm confident that we'll continue to build on the current momentum we have in our business outside of the U.S. and capitalize on the tremendous opportunities that exist.", "I'll now move on to results from the Global Consumer Products Group. Our CPG segment continued its recent momentum in the third quarter, completing the first full quarter under our direct distribution model for packaged coffee and tea. This model now gives us total control over the selling and distribution to retailers of these products, as well as VIA. K-Cups will be added to the lineup beginning this fall, which, along with our coffee authority and brand recognition, will create an unmatched proposition for our trade customers in the coffee category.", "In the fiscal third quarter, total net revenues for CPG were $218 million, an increase of 25% over last year. Slightly more than half of the increase was related to the packaged coffee and tea business as a result of the transition in-house, as well as pricing. The remainder of the increase was driven by our Foodservice business and the expanded distribution of VIA into grocery.  VIA continues to perform well. Sales for the most recent 4-week period were up 41% over last year, and repeat rates continue to trend among the highest in the industry at roughly 38%.", "CPG operating income for the quarter totaled $66 million, a 20% increase compared to the third quarter of last year. The operating margin of 30.2% was 130 basis points lower than the same quarter last year. Higher coffee costs had a significant impact this quarter, accounting for roughly 1,000 basis points of margin deterioration. This was partially offset by less marketing spend, as we are lapping over last year's launch of VIA into the CPG channel.", "Overall, we are extremely pleased with the transition of the packaged coffee and tea business and the financial impact has been in line with our expectations. The minor share erosion we experienced early in the quarter, driven by less promotional and display activity as the previously distribution arrangement ended, has already given way to solid recovery. Packaged coffee sales have recorded double-digit growth over the recent 4-week period versus last year, despite some recent volume weakness in the overall category.", "In the last several months, we've had a dedicated focus on the transition, ensuring that it was seamless to our trade customers. With this work now behind us, anticipation is building within the trade around what we will now be able to bring to the coffee aisle. With the planned launch of K-Cups in the fall adding to an already strong packaged coffee lineup and an ongoing build-out of the VIA platform, Starbucks has an unmatched coffee portfolio in CPG. Our ambitions outside our retail store channel are bold and will take time to fully capitalize on the opportunity. But I'm confident that the assets we own and the teams we now have in place provide the foundation to achieve those goals.", "Before I move on to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2011 and a first look at fiscal 2012, I want to take a moment to recognize Starbucks' supply chain organization. This group recently received a remarkable, well-deserved achievement, ranking for the first time in the top 25 of global supply chains as rated by Gartner AMR, a well-known research firm in this field. We're very proud of this achievement, given the significant transformation that team has gone through over the past few years, first, retooling that organization to drive improved efficiency and accuracy, and more recently, bolstering its infrastructure and talent to support our blueprint for growth. This ranking recognizes the tremendous progress we have made, noting Starbucks' focus on improving overall supply chain performance, differentiating ourselves from our peers on accelerated commercialization of new products, our long-term programs to grow and acquire supply chain talent, and the approach and speed in which the supply chain organization has improved its performance. Congratulations to Peter Gibbons and his team on this well-deserved recognition.", "We entered fiscal 2011 with strong momentum throughout our business and a cautious optimism that those trends would continue, despite the uncertain economy and the gathering headwinds from commodities. As the year progressed, our business performed beyond our expectations, as the focused efforts of our partners helped drive additional traffic into our stores.", "Now with 3 quarters of the fiscal year behind us, I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on how we expect the year to close out. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter is expected to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.36 and EPS for the full year 2011 is now expected to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.51, modestly above the previously communicated 15% to 20% growth over 2010 non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding the benefit in 2010 from the 53rd week. In addition to the earnings outlook, we now expect approximately 10% revenue growth on a comparable 52-week basis driven by comp growth at the high end of our target range of 3% to 7%.", "Excluding the impact from the Borders store closures, we now plan to add approximately 600 net new stores globally, with roughly 100 in the U.S. and approximately 500 in international markets. The majority of the new additions in both segments are expected to be licensed stores. Through the end of the quarter, 228 Seattle's Best Coffee stores closed as a result of the Borders bankruptcy. The 247 stores that remained are expected to be closed this week. As previously communicated, we took charges related to the Borders portfolio in the first and second quarters, and we do not have any meaningful exposure remaining. We still expect to absorb approximately $0.22 in additional commodity costs compared to fiscal 2010, primarily driven by coffee. Roughly $0.08 of this amount is expected to be absorbed in the fourth quarter.", "Full year operating margins for both the U.S. and International segments are now expected to finish near the high end of the previously communicated 150 to 200 basis point improvement compared to last year's non-GAAP results. Operating margins of the CPG segment are also now expected to finish near the high end of the previously communicated range of 25% to 30%. The expected results, on a consolidated basis after the impact from the Borders charges, remains at 50 to 100 basis point improvement compared to last year's non-GAAP operating margin.", "I will now provide you with a high-level initial look at several fiscal 2012 targets. These targets are presented under the current segment reporting structure, not yet reflecting the reorganization announced recently. I plan to provide the fiscal 2012 targets under the new segment reporting structure during the November year-end conference call.", "We expect approximately 10% revenue growth for the year, consistent with the rate of growth this year and driven by mid-single digit comp growth, approximately 800 net new stores and strong growth in the CPG business. Of the approximately 800 net new stores we expect to add, roughly 200 are expected to be in the U.S. and roughly 600 in International. Approximately half of the new additions in the U.S. will be licensed stores. Internationally, roughly 2/3 of new additions will be licensed, consistent with our current mix outside the U.S. We expect China to account for approximately 1/4 of the International new store additions.", "We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million for fiscal 2012, reflecting the increase in new stores planned. Full year operating margin improvement is expected to be 50 to 100 basis points on a consolidated level, with improvement expected in U.S. and International retail operations, offset by moderately lower volumes -- margins, excuse me, in the CPG business.  Sales leverage and operational efficiencies will continue to drive the margin improvement in U.S. and International, offsetting pressure from commodities.", "Similar to this year, we expect CPG margins to be impacted more significantly by commodity increases, since coffee is a larger share of the overall cost structure for this business. Additionally, we'll continue to invest for future growth in CPG as we launch K-Cups and expand the VIA platform. As a result, we expect CPG operating margin near 25% in fiscal 2012.", "We expect fiscal 2012 earnings per share growth to be in the range of 15% to 20% consistent with our long-term outlook range. We expect pressure from commodity costs to continue into the next year. As we had anticipated, in recent weeks, coffee prices have retreated significantly from a high of more than $3 per pound at just a couple of months ago, to levels now near $2.40 per pound. As prices have been falling, we continued locking up our needs for fiscal '12, and now have virtually the full year price protected. At these contracted levels, we expect the elevated coffee cost to negatively impact earnings by approximately $0.21 per share in fiscal '12 compared to fiscal '11. That additional cost is already fully reflected in our 15% to 20% EPS growth target for next year.", "Global demand for coffee continues to grow, which underscores the huge opportunity for Starbucks' expansion in the years ahead. And while that demand growth undoubtedly has pressured coffee commodity costs from the levels of 1 year or 2 ago, the recent significant decline supports the analysis we have available to us, that the spike to $3 was fueled much more by speculation. We now have very good visibility into our key input costs for the coming year and have continued great confidence in our ability to meet our growth targets.", "Lastly, I'd like to highlight our expectations for the highly anticipated launch of Starbucks K-Cups. K-Cups are expected to be available this fall in the U.S. CPG channel in time for the important holiday period. Based on the extraordinarily strong early response and the anticipated demand from our trade customers, we expect to be able to ramp up the distribution, awareness and adoption relatively quickly for new product introduction. We expect K-Cups to add approximately $0.03 to $0.05 in incremental earnings per share in fiscal 2012, already included in the 15% to 20% EPS growth target reflecting the significant investment plan to support the CPG launch. Due to the manufacturing capacity that is needed to support the CPG demand, we now expect to launch K-Cups in our U.S. retail stores to occur very late in 2012. Therefore, we do not expect any financial benefit in fiscal '12 from the retail launch.", "Our third quarter results further demonstrate the unique strength of the Starbucks brand, our retail store portfolio and our evolving multichannel growth model. Despite stiff headwinds in the form of higher commodity costs and a fragile consumer environment, we were able to achieve record results while continuing to invest for the future. We are still in the very early stages of our pursuit to build a one-of-a-kind company that reaches consumers throughout the world in multiple channels and formats, while maintaining a deep connection to our customers. As we continue to see more proof points, we're increasingly confident that this vision will begin to play out in the coming quarters and years. Our recently announced organizational changes will allow us to more clearly focus on the unique complexities inherent in each region around the globe, as we expand our retail presence while driving growth in our emerging businesses.", "The strategies to pursue the tremendous global opportunities are clearly defined. Our management team is experienced and energized, and we're backed by strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow. We have an extremely solid foundation in place to pursue ambitious profitable growth in fiscal 2012 and beyond.", "With that, now let me turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Christian?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "The questions are related and they relate to the K-Cups. First, could you talk about the $0.03 to $0.05? That sounds like it's a net number of some launch costs. If you're willing to talk about what you think those launch costs are, so maybe we can back into what you think the run rate is without those costs. And what -- just clarify your decision, I guess, not to launch these into your stores until late in 2012? That's like -- it sounds like it's a capacity issue or is there something else behind it strategically where you want to get it established? It would seem like you'd want to, if there was a choice to be made, you'd want to bring it to stores earlier to help that adoption faster for K-Cups and bring new people into that system, so why are you choosing the opposite strategy?", "Troy Alstead", "First on the $0.03 to $0.05, yes, you're right. That's a net number, it reflects our commitment to launch this new product and any new product in the right way, which will include meaningful spend against it over the first, second and likely third years, similar to what we're doing with VIA to really ensure that we are capturing the consumer demand that's available to us in building the proposition for the long term. So $0.03 to $0.05 is a nice contribution in the first year. It is not at, by any means, a mature margin contribution level in 2012 because of the spend we'll put against it. We won't quantify that spend quite yet, but I think as we move through 2012, we'll provide more visibility to what that looks like as we go. Now to the second part of your question, the launch in CPG is expected to consume really all the available capacity we have for Starbucks K-Cups. So in partnership with the Green Mountain, we've agreed to put the launch of K-Cups in the Starbucks stores late in the fiscal year. And that will ensure that we have all the volumes we need for what we think will be a very, very attractive and exciting launch in the CPG channel. Perhaps it's distinct from VIA, where we used our retail stores to build awareness of the product. What we know about K-Cups is that consumer awareness and the pent-up demand already exists, because it's an existing platform that's out there. And so we have the opportunity here to launch into CPG directly and first, and really capture a huge opportunity during that very, very critical holiday period. So that's what's behind that decision.", "Howard Schultz", "Troy, let me add one more thing to that. John, I think we're going to get the best of both worlds. We're going to draft off the momentum that already exists on K-Cups in the channels that they're already in, and the demand so far in terms of response has been significant in terms of selling process. But our calendar at retail is anywhere from 12 to 18 months forward. And we have a very robust product and promotional plan already in place, so I think on a parallel track, we're going to get all the benefits that exist from K-Cups and complementary channels. We're going to have a robust plan within our retail stores. And then we're going to come right after that in the late 2012 with K-Cups. So we feel we're in a very unique and very positive positions to take advantage of multiple channels of distribution that no one else has other than Starbucks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sarah Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein", "I wanted to ask another question about CPG business. Just thinking about the sort of VIA, you said 70,000 points of distribution. Can you give some color on which market is doing the best? What kind of distribution you have? I'm just trying to think forward if the K-Cups were or a single-serve product were to be available kind of internationally, what is the receptivity of the customer base, sort of broadly speaking, to Starbucks and single-serve?", "Troy Alstead", "I'm going to be ask Jeff Hansberry, our President of Consumer Products, to take that question.", "Jeff Hansberry", "Our strongest market and most mature market for VIA is the U.S. market, and we've been in market now for about one year. Our distribution stands at about 71% ACV per IRI. And in the last month, we grew at 41%. What's really encouraging on VIA is we continue to see growth both in winter and summer, as Howard mentioned in his comments, on Iced VIA. It's really countercyclical to coffee, so we're seeing growth around Iced VIA in the summer. Beyond that, we're seeing our repeat rates actually climb, and they're now at 38%, which is very encouraging. We're going to follow that with the launch of Breakfast Blend and House Blend in CPG this fall in the U.S. So we're very encouraged by the progress we're seeing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank", "Troy, question on CapEx, that $700 million guidance for fiscal '12. seemed just a little bit high to me, given the fact that the new company stores or the new store base in general will be heavy on China within the company store base internationally, and then licensed stores overall. So could you perhaps just give some color on the CapEx number, where -- how does that break down?", "Troy Alstead", "Yes, the breakout, David, is similar to the mix of our spend in years past, where new stores are a piece of that component but not the majority and not even half, actually. Our ongoing commitment to remodel our store base at similar levels to this year, although perhaps slightly higher in the year ahead, contribute a bit to that CapEx. But most meaningfully, the increase from 2011 to 2012 expected CapEx is driven by new stores, as we are growing all around the world. I will point out, it's -- these are early targets and we'll fine-tune that number for you throughout the year as we go.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "I guess the question on China, where obviously those comps are kind of jaw-dropping that you're seeing there. And I guess, just curious, having watched you for a long time as you've grown in China, are you seeing, daypart utilization change, the mix of food versus beverages or just the general customer that's coming into the stores, has that really been changing over the past year?", "Howard Schultz", "Troy, you want me to take that?", "Troy Alstead", "Sure and -- go ahead. Go ahead, Howard.", "Howard Schultz", "Is John in the room as well?", "Troy Alstead", "Yes, he's here. He can follow on after you start the answer.", "Howard Schultz", "Okay. Let me begin by saying, I think few people remember that we've been in China now over 12 years. And during that time, I think we did a very good job of just building the brand in a way that would not be faddish but really trying to create the coffee ritual and demonstrate to Chinese local customers the relevancy of the Starbucks brand. I think early on, the stores were actually more popular than the coffee, because our stores literally became the third place between home and work. And most Chinese people live in smaller dwellings, and they use our stores as great meeting places. Over the last couple of years, what really has taken place is that the traffic has been building in multiple dayparts. And we're certainly beginning to see the early stages of the morning ritual. Although we have a long way to go, and I think that gives us even more opportunity and I think more excitement, because these numbers are being generated, really thus far, without the morning daypart being as significant as they are in other parts of the world. I think perhaps the most encouraging aspect of our Chinese business today is the response that we're getting in secondary and tertiary markets in cities that most Americans have never heard of, with populations ranging from 1 million to 6 million to 7 million people. In these markets, the response and the unaided awareness of Starbucks lines out the door in terms of almost a rite of passage as a result of Starbucks opening up in these cities. So when we look at the number of cities in China that are going to have 1 million people or more, and the government officials are telling us it's going to be over 100 cities, these are -- the opportunity, I think we have, is very significant. The challenge from the very beginning is to ensure the fact that we do not become something that's faddish. The hardest part in building a new brand in Asia is to make sure you do not become white hot and then all of a sudden, out of favor. I think we've done a very good job in building really strong local relevancy and relationships with customers, vendors and the government. And as a result of that, the local Chinese Starbucks team is off to a great start. I've said for the last couple of years, there's going to be lots challenges in China. We've learned a lot. We've made some mistakes. But we're going to have thousands of stores there and build a very big significant business, not only in our retail stores but the blueprint of growth in terms of complementary channels of distribution and other products are a significant part of the strategy.", "John Culver", "This is John Culver on the call. Just a couple of things I would add on to what Howard just said. First off, in terms of the growth that we're seeing in China across all the markets to include the new cities that Howard talked about, it's being driven through transaction growth. And so it's attracting more customers in and continuing to increase the level of frequency of those customers coming into our stores. In addition, we've had some new innovations that we introduced in the quarter with our customizable Frappuccino, which was a huge success in China. And then also, we introduced VIA in both the mainland China as well as Taiwan and Hong Kong in the quarter. And the early results on VIA in China are very, very impressive, so we're very excited about that. And then also, as part of our integration into the Chinese culture and into the Chinese community, is the relationship that we're building in the Yunnan province around coffee, and Howard talked about that as part of the opening, but we're very excited about the opportunities this presents for us long term to continue to grow the business, and increasing the level of dayparts in the -- to our stores as well. So very good news in China.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Just a question on cash, you gave a lot of color on 2012. We didn't talk much about cash flow, you said, just yet. But I think like -- I know you guys are running north of $1 billion in cash currently on hand and my guess is you're running north of $1 billion of free cash likely next year. And I know you have significant available credit. I'm just wondering, I mean the dividend in the kind of low 1% range, should we think about the excess for -- primarily for share repurchase? I mean how should we think about 2012? I know you've alluded in the past the potential acquisition above and beyond kind of returning cash to shareholders. Whether you have any thoughts on whether an acquisition, might be U.S. or International or on beverages versus other areas such as food, kind of any thoughts you have on the use of cash and potential for acquisition?", "Troy Alstead", "Sure. You're right on your early part of that, Jeff, in the sense that we have well over $1 billion in cash in the balance sheet today, closer to $2 billion. We have a business that's produced a very, very healthy $1 billion in free cash flow, and I would fully expect that or better as we look at fiscal 2012. So we have the opportunity with that strong balance sheet and a healthy cash-producing company to do a number of things. And part of that is in returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases. We are committed to a share repurchase program that is based on valuation. And so we will, at different times, be in the market and will certainly return cash as appropriate through repurchases. We also have ongoing dividend program that's based on a targeted payout ratio. So as our earnings grow, I would expect dividends to grow over the years as well to match that, to stay within that range of the ratio. So those elements will likely grow, as time goes on and as our income grows. And then further, of course, we'll invest back in our business through CapEx, through growing the health of our infrastructure, to invest in our partners, that's fully appropriate. And with all that said, yes, we do expect that we'll be more active in M&A in the years ahead than we have been in the years past, as we see tremendous opportunity to leverage our capabilities and our speed to market in some areas and really further build out our blueprint for growth through selective, we think, smart and strategic acquisitions. So that will be part of the equation, and certainly shapes are thinking about cash as we look forward.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Any thought whether that'd be U.S. or international, or beverage versus food organ, or kind of directionally, which way you'd like to go?", "Troy Alstead", "Well, I -- our interests are very much global. So yes, we're looking at what opportunities there are in the U.S. but very much with our increased focus outside of the U.S., around development, we're really looking at all our geographies, key geographies, existing geographies, some of the emerging markets that we're in and evaluating what possibilities might be there. So very much of a global answer, I can't give you a specific breakout because we're not targeting it that way. But I can tell you that our interests are very broad-based.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Keith Siegner with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Troy, just a question for you on CPG, and kind of thinking about the margins from 2011 to 2012 and kind of going from let's say, the guidance this year, the high end of the range around 30% to 25% next year. When you think about that walk through, clearly, it's sounds like we're going to have headwinds from commodities, but how does the first full year without transition costs for packaged coffee, is that a positive? What about the K-Cups, is that positive to margins? In other words like, are we going to have another 1,000 basis points headwind from commodities and these other things I've said? If you could walk through those moving pieces year-over-year, that'd be great.", "Troy Alstead", "Sure, Keith. Let me speak to some of those pieces. One is yes, commodities, as I mentioned earlier, are absolutely a headwind for us in the full business. And that's most acutely impactful on margins in CPG, as it's a much more cost-intensive cost structure, as you know. I can tell you that the decline, as I spoke about earlier, from about 30% operating margin in CPG this year down to the targeted 25% next year is really all explained by commodities. Absent commodity inflation, we'd be at or improving our margin in the coming year. Now with that said, there are a few other moving pieces as well. K-Cups in its initial year will not be at mature margin levels that we expect to grow to with that exciting product over time, as we will spend against it, just as we have with VIA. So that's very accretive to earnings to the tune of $0.03 to $0.05 per share, but it will be somewhat lower margin in its first year too as we spend against that development. Similar VIA as we continue to grow and expand and invest behind VIA, that is profitable. It'll be more profitable in '12 than it was in 11. And yet, the margin structure on VIA will continue to be somewhat lower than what we see in the rest of our consumer products business. So those are some of the moving pieces, but I would just come back to the fact that it's really the biggest mover there, it's coffee costs. And that's the biggest driver that's resulting in that lower end of the 25% to 30% range next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Howard, just a question on the new organizational structure. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more context on how you envision that structure helping the business? Maybe provide some specific examples of how you're thinking about using that structure to accelerate your International growth. And then Troy, maybe as a quick follow-up, if you could talk about whether that structure is going to lead to any efficiencies on the financial side.", "Howard Schultz", "Okay. I think there are a number of ways in which the company is going to benefit as a result of this new structure and alignment. But let me begin with what I said in my remarks, and that is John Culver and his team have done a, really, a spectacular job over the last 2 years in bringing International to the operating margin that is as respectable as it is today. But we think there's a long way to go. John and I have been talking for the past year or so just how broad-based his geography was. Just think about managing 50 countries, 50-plus countries and trying to be as present as possible in all of the geographies and the complexities of these organizations, as well as the fact that these markets are not all alike. International is not one organization. It's very different, diverse markets, different levels of maturity in terms of coffee and different levels of maturity just in terms of Starbucks brand. And so we began thinking about how can we leverage Starbucks' strongest operating talent against the biggest opportunity we have in terms of retail growth and the global opportunity, where we really believe we're in the nascent stage with only 6,000 stores. And I think given what Cliff has been able to do in the U.S. since he came here from Europe in transforming the U.S. business, if you divide the 3 territories with Michelle Gass, who's been with the company 15 years and really knows every aspect of our business, and put her in Europe and the Middle East, and put Cliff in the Americas, and then leave John where he once lived in Hong Kong and took care of China and Asia Pacific, we now have 3 very, very strong Starbucks' leaders really going after growing the business in a different way. A good example, to be specific, is let's take country of Brazil. Brazil's a market that we think we can have at least 1,000 stores there, at least. And we're sitting with less than 100. It's a market that we know we're understored in and we just have not been able to be as present in terms of our focus and attention. I think with Cliff's leadership, Brazil will become a significant growth driver for the company. If we look at Europe and the opportunities that we think we have to leverage the blueprint of growth, with complementary channels of distribution with CPG and foodservice, a background that Michelle has with a company, she'll be able, I think, to leverage that insight and experience across Europe in ways that we haven't to date. And then if we look at Asia Pacific, the area where we think we have the greatest opportunity in terms of growth, John will be singular-focused with his entire organization on Asia Pacific, specifically China and the opening of India, which is extremely complex with big upsides, but lots of complexity to open India in 2012. So I think this is the beginning of, I think, realigning the organization in ways that we haven't before, and I think most importantly, taking all of the learnings that we've applied to the North American business over the last 2.5 years that have literally transformed the economics and the results, and bringing that to bear across the International markets with 3 very strong leaders. So I think this is a great move for the company. I credit John for his leadership in this, and I think Cliff and Michelle will do a fantastic job.", "Troy Alstead", "And David, to the second part of your question, as you just heard from Howard, the full, complete, entire motivation behind the restructure is about enabling growth. It's about positioning us with strong talent and teams, who can be focused on the uniqueness and the complexities of these individual regions around the world. So this restructure is not about seeking efficiencies. It is completely about going after the huge opportunity we see around the world that's been really validated by the growth in the last couple of years, the margin improvement, and now building on the great work in the last couple of years. This restructure allows us to accelerate and go after that more meaningfully. Now with that said, while there's no motivation around efficiencies here, as we drive growth and drive the top line in the years ahead as a result of this increased focus, I fully expect to drive margin improvement as a result of that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gregory Badishkanian with Citigroup.", "Jeffrey Hans", "This is Jeff Hans speaking on behalf of Greg. You guys have done another remarkable job growing traffic on a 2-year trend in the U.S., despite -- this past quarter, despite a still pretty fragile consumer environment. So you -- can you guys talk a little bit about that disconnect? What's sort of driving that momentum in your business? And then what type of initiatives do you have in place in the near term to maybe sustain some of that?", "Howard Schultz", "Well, I think we've said from day 1 beginning in 2008 when we were really dealing with the height of the cataclysmic financial crisis, despite the challenges we were having at that time, we were not going to use the economy or the lack of consumer confidence as an excuse to grow our business. And I think nothing has changed. We are not looking at the economic environment. We're looking at what we can do to exceed expectations of our customers and create a great experience in every aspect of our business for both our people and our customers. And that has not changed. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we have a great, robust level of innovation, a pipeline of new products and new promotions. And as we head into the fall and holiday season, we're as enthused as we were in the last couple of years. I think when you look at the comp number overall at 8% globally or 9% for the U.S., these are stunning accomplishments, not only in spite of the economy. But if you look at other retailers or restaurants, these are top of class. Can we sustain those kinds of numbers over the next 12 months? I can't answer the question in the affirmative. I think Troy has given a good guidance in terms of mid-single-digit comps. But we're very confident that the -- what we have put in place in terms of consumer-facing initiatives and the level of innovation, not only in products and experience but through technology, that we're going to be able to create separation between us and everybody else. Two years ago, when the world was coming to an end, not only were we dealing with economy, but there was concern about McDonald's and others, and I think we've done a very good job in creating the kind of experience that really does differentiate Starbucks from everybody else both in terms of experience, the quality, the coffee and the relationship our customers have with our people. That has not changed. We're going to continue to invest in what is most important around the equity of the brand and any of the experience that we create in our stores. And we think that's going to continue to drive very strong comp store growth domestically and internationally.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.", "Joseph Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I want to go back to China again for a moment. First on the transactions that gave you control of mainland China, are there any financial implications here from earnings standpoint to be aware of, just from the transactions alone? And then talk about changes that you'll execute, now that it is completely company-controlled, particularly with the expansion. How quickly do you think that will ramp either higher than what you provided for 2012 for guidance?", "Troy Alstead", "Joe, I'll speak to the first part, and then ask John Culver to jump in on the second piece of it. There is some transaction accounting that comes to play with the purchase this quarter. It's not a pretty meaningful number. It shows up in other operating income, so it's below the margin line, but there is a modest gain that shows up there and is responsible for some of the increase in that other operating expense -- or the income line that you'll see in our financial statements. Now in terms of what we'll do from here, I'll ask John to jump in.", "John Culver", "Yes, Joe, in terms of the transaction itself and the integration of the business, really it's seamless. We've had operating control of that business within the partnership. What this allows us to do is buy back the equity portion of our business partner that was there and take over full control and operations from a P&L perspective with the business. So in terms of any changes, no changes other than the fact that it now allows us to go on uninhibited in terms of pushing the accelerator on growth there. And that's what we have here every intention of doing.", "Howard Schultz", "Joe, I just have one thing. And I think it's more than a subtle coincidence that the alignment of Cliff, John and Michelle are also coming at a time when we are acquiring these businesses back. I think there is a symmetry to the fact that we've got our best talent against a company-operated operation across the globe. And I think it's going to add significant long-term value to our shareholders. It's the right thing to do for our company and it's coming at a time when we really have the organization in place.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I just wanted to ask about the International traffic number, which stayed the same even though China accelerated to the 30s. I guess I was curious what the negative offsets were in the International division and maybe what -- a status update on what's going on in those markets?", "John Culver", "Yes, Mike, I'll speak to that. China, as I've said was extremely strong, even improving over previously. All our other company-owned markets remain positive and generally in good trends. The softest market we had was our largest international market, and that's in Canada. Again, positive same-store sales but a bit softer and that's due in parts to some -- in Western Canada, the harmonization of taxes impacted all of retailers including us, and so there's a little bit of softness that we've seen as a result of that, as well as some ongoing weather that contributed to our softness in Canada. But that's really, again, very consistent traffic to a large degree in U.K., and very, very strong improving traffic as we have talked about in China.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just, I think, few pretty quick ones. Looking, obviously, at your average unit volumes or same-store sales in the United States, and you've given what's obviously been a very high competency of opening units. Why is the company-operated unit -- and maybe, Howard, talking about your previous point with some of your best talent being focused on company-owned markets, why isn't it that number higher in 2012? Why is it 100 units? And I guess should we think about if trends continue, possibly 2013 is a breakout year to reopen a lot of the U.S., this is first question. And then secondly, how should we think about pricing for the remainder of '12? I mean is that something that you think you can do if you need it? I mean, could it be something that kind of in your arsenal, if you will, if commodity costs don't stay where they are currently?", "Howard Schultz", "With regard to U.S. growth, I think one thing I'd like to say is I think for anyone to conclude that the U.S. market is reaching a level of saturation for us, I think would be a wrong conclusion. I think what is occurring though is that during the downturn in the economy, when we stopped searching and securing U.S. retail sites and downsized the acquisition of real estate organizationally, we lost a lot of time. So it takes an entire organization, it takes a long time to secure sites, design stores. And I think we lost probably 1.5 years because of the downsize of the organization during the financial crisis. And so we're just building back that organization, and the lead times are great. For me personally, I remain bullish and enthusiastic about our ability to grow the U.S. business beyond the 100 store level per year. But organizationally, we've got to be in a position to be able to do that. And what I do not want to do and we will not do is have an undisciplined approach to real estate acquisition. We want to be extremely careful and highly disciplined to make sure that the return on investment. I think, what we're most proud of is the class of stores we've opened up in the last year, in terms of sales return on investment and sales to investment ratio, is of highest we've had in many, many years. And Troy can speak to that specifically.", "Troy Alstead", "Yes, our new store class in the last couple of years have continued to strengthen. And we've always had very good unit economics though it suffered a bit during the difficult days of a couple of years ago, but since then with the discipline that Howard mentioned around site selection, around close management of our new store costs, we have been able to improve those economic significantly to the point now where it is very, very attractive for us to invest in our U.S. business and add stores. Howard's point though, we fully intend to do that in the right way and at the right pace. And I would expect that new store will, while it's doubling in 2012, I would expect it to grow further in 2013 as we ramp up our capabilities and we position ourselves for growth. Now John, to the second part of your question around pricing, we have been, as you know, very judicious, very cautious in what we've done with pricing. And that comes out of a tremendous sensitivity to the consumer around value and around the place they're at right now. We've taken less pricing than just about everybody else out there down in coffee. And the result of that, I believe, has been a couple of things. One is the -- our results and our ability to drive traffic and increase frequency, speaks to a number of things we're doing around customer service and product innovation and relative program, but it also speaks, I think, to our value. And consumers recognizing that extreme quality we're offering them at a good value, as we've been careful with what we've done with our strategic pricing in our stores, and we've been conservative. Look at what we've done with pricing down the grocery aisle. I think it's no coincidence that we are one of the rare companies down the aisle that's actually growing volumes right now in coffee. While there is dollar share growth in some places driven by pricing, we've been cautious about that, and like the idea of grabbing volume share and positioning ourselves much better for the future. And what that does, I believe, is it allows us to drive earnings and meet our growth targets. It also allows us to preserve some pricing power for the future, if it's needed. And so we'll be cautious about it. We'll be careful about it, but it gives us tremendous flexibility that perhaps others don't have, as we approach the next year or 2.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "As we think about fiscal '12 and modeling on a quarterly basis, can you maybe give us a little bit of color just in the context, it seems like you might be marketing heavily behind K-Cup perhaps in the fall? And then of course, there is the coffee costs, which I would think would perhaps maybe decelerate on a year-over-year basis. Is it safe to say that if comps just say were to remain at the same level throughout the year, that we should expect the calendarization of earnings growth maybe to start off slower and end up stronger? And if you could maybe just give us some light on the calendarization of earnings growth.", "Troy Alstead", "Sure, Mitch. It's a bit early to be too specific about quarters. Probably, tell you a little bit more about that in November. But what I'll say for now is, yes, you're correct that coffee costs will likely be a bit more of an acute pain for us in the first half of the year, year-over-year. Simply because as we went through 2010, those coffee costs accelerated as we went. And so in the early part of the year, we'll be lapping relatively lower costs from a year ago, and so that year-over-year differential is a little bit more costly to us in the first part of the year than will be the second half of the year. Again, more specifics to come as we see how things play out throughout the year. And then beyond that, there is always lots of ups and downs. We, as you pointed out, will be launching K-Cups in the fall and -- but I think that's extreme positive for us and we're very much optimistic about it. We'll be spending against it, but K-Cups will be profitable for us, so I don't expect that to particularly drive calendarization. So to large degree, coffee is the one thing I could point out to you right now. And again, when we get to November, we'll talk a little bit more about how the quarters look.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, We have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers. Ms. DeGrande, are there any closing remarks?", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Just briefly. Thank you, Christian. Thank you all for joining us today. That does conclude our third fiscal quarter call for 2011, and we will talk to you in November.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's Starbucks Coffee Company Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call.

With me today are Howard Schultz, Chairman; Jim Donald, President and CEO; Michael Casey, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mary Ekman, Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations.", "During today\u2019s call, Jim will review key results and accomplishments for the fourth quarter and the full year as well as provide some highlights from our US retail business, Howard will provide an update on our international business and our music and entertainment initiatives, and Michael will highlight the key drivers behind our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006 results.

The company assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.", "Jim Donald", "Thank you, JoAnn, and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Fiscal 2006 was another strong year for Starbucks as we continued to do more of the very same, delivering solid consistent performance by surprising, delighting our customers every day with product innovations, retail locations in places where our customers want us and through the extension of the Starbucks brand outside our retail stores. We have achieved a number of accomplishments this year. So, let me begin with a quick review of our store development endeavors, followed by an overview of our fiscal year financial results, and then a few highlights from the fourth quarter.", "During fiscal 2006, we delivered a record number of store openings, 2,199 to be exact. This equates to an average of six new stores per day. When you compare fiscal 2006 store openings to fiscal 2005, it is clear that we continued the momentum with consistent execution as we opened over 30% more stores this year than last.", "Due to the strength in our store development capabilities paired with strong demand for Starbucks locations, we surpassed our regional store count target of 1,800 stores by nearly 400. And we continue to see tremendous opportunity in store openings both in the US and international markets.", "This year, we are targeting the opening of at least 2,400 locations worldwide. Of note, we have grown our store base by a compound annual growth rate of more than 21% over the past five years. Additionally, we believe we can ultimately have 40,000 locations worldwide with half of those locations outside the US.", "With so much development in growth, the natural question might be, how have these investments impacted Starbucks' financial health? Let me reassure you. We've achieved robust store expansion, delivered strong financial performance, increased our equity ownership in international markets and continue to foster innovation throughout our business around the world.", "Let me talk about some specifics. In fiscal year 2006, we served our customers more than 40 million times per week in 12,440 Starbucks locations in 37 countries. We delivered consolidated net revenues of $7.8 billion, increase of 22%, which exceeded our growth target comprised of solid increases in both retail and specialty revenues.", "We reported comparable store sales growth of 7% for the year including 5% transaction growth and 2% ticket growth. We delivered net earnings of $564 million compared to $494 million in fiscal 2005. And earnings per share for the year came at $0.73 compared to $0.61 per share in fiscal 2005 excluding the impact of new accounting requirement for asset retirement obligations, which Michael will review later in the call.", "We exited 2006 in a solid position, have set aggressive growth targets for our current fiscal year, and we look forward to continuing a positive momentum in fiscal 2007.", "Now, it's important to note that these results and the aggressive financial targets we have set for fiscal 2007, are all driven by the same consistent strategy to remain focused on delivering value to our culture of product innovation, serving premium quality products and continue investing in our passionate partners who provide legendary customer service, and the numbers speak for themselves.", "Our average unit volumes continue to increase. Fiscal 2006, average unit volumes for US company-operated stores grew to over $1 million. Additionally, first year sales in our fiscal 2006 new stores in the US have continued to perform well delivering an estimated $920,000.", "Now, let me recap some of the highlights specific to the fourth quarter. Consolidated net revenues grew by 21% to $2 billion, with net earnings of $117 million. Comparable store sales grew 5% for the quarter, 4% by transaction growth and 1% by higher ticket. As we grow our business, Starbucks Experience continues to be universally relevant and accepted. Let's review both the innovations and traditions Starbucks had and will deliver in order to continue this growth.", "During the quarter, we continue to build on what makes Starbucks unique. Product innovation, legendary service and execution and the focus clearly paid-off. During the fourth quarter, Starbucks US company-operated retail locations delivered $1.4 billion in revenues. Key drivers behind this quarter were innovations across our beverage menu, as well as our food offerings.", "Beverages introduced during the fourth quarter included our new Frappuccino Juice Blends, offered in two popular flavors, Pomegranate and Tangerine, and the return of one of our highly anticipated seasonal flavor Pumpkin Spice. The continued success of Pumpkin Spice provides an excellent trailer to the return of our popular holiday beverage trio, Peppermint Mocha, Gingerbread Latte and Eggnog Latte.", "Again during the fourth quarter and for the year, food was a strong contributor to sales in all three categories -- Bakery, Lunch and Warming. Food continues to be a growing part of our business, and fiscal 2006 demonstrated significant progress in capturing some of the potential opportunities we have identified. We've enhanced our offerings introducing additional reduced fat options in bakery and our new yogurt parfait. We've added new lunch items, we've expanded our grab-and-go lunches into new markets and to more stores, and we saw substantial expansion of our warm breakfast sandwich program, more than tripling the number of stores in which it is offered year-over-year.", "Let me first bring you up-to-date on expansion of lunch. At the end of our fiscal 2006, we had offerings in 21 markets, with the newest being Atlanta. Our customers now have the options to purchase lunch along with their favorite beverage in more than 4,150 locations within the US and Canada. This is in addition of nearly 1,000 locations during the year, an increase of 32% when compared to this time last year. Think about it this way, lunch is offered in 67% of our US company-operated locations and 70% of our company-operated locations in Canada.", "Now let's shift to one of our newest food innovation, the warm breakfast sandwiches. More and more of our customers around the US will be able to enjoy warm breakfast items as we aggressively expand the stores providing warming at fiscal 2007. In fact, by this time next year, we estimate that approximately 3,400 Starbucks stores will feature warm breakfast items and that\u2019s compared to approximately 1,000 locations today, which includes our latest market launch in New York in early October. Not only just warming offer our customers a premium quality breakfast option, but also provides us a nice incremental revenue contribution, delivering approximately $35,000 in additional annual sales to those stores offering the products.", "Looking at what's in our stores today, last week marked the return of our popular holiday beverage including the Peppermint, Gingerbread and Eggnog beverage trio. Starbucks Christmas Blend whole bean coffee, returning seasonal food favorites and fantastic gift ideas, which we believe will strengthen our customer loyalty.", "We also brought back the perfect food pairings to accompany our holiday beverages, the Cranberry Bliss Bar and the gingerbread loaf, which offer a tasty indulgence. Additionally, a favorite customer lunch offering will also be featured again this year, Grandma's Turkey Sandwich, which is available in stores through out the holidays.", "Turning to merchandise, this year's holiday assortment is a wonderful mix of old favorites and new traditions, making Starbucks a convenient destination for our customers' holiday shopping. Again this year, we featured everything from stocking stuffers to holiday serveware to special holiday prices on our brewing equipment. A few of our merchandise items includes new holiday Barista Bears, Starbucks exclusive gift packs, two new seasonal Starbucks card designs, new Hear Music holiday CDs and audio books and a new ten-cup brewer that is exclusive to Starbucks.", "Before I close, I'd like to spend a little time discussing our ongoing commitment to preserving the core of our company and that\u2019s coffee. In fiscal 2004, we formally introduced C.A.F.E. practices, which helps ensure Starbucks purchases coffee that is grown and processed in a sustainable manner. Additionally, C.A.F.E. practices help secure Starbucks coffee supply using environmental and social responsible practices. During the fiscal 2006, we set a goal of purchasing 150 million pounds of coffee through C.A.F.E. Practices. I am very pleased to report that we surpassed that goal and we'll continue our work in this area. Our new goal is to purchase 225 million pounds of C.A.F.E. Practices-verified coffee during fiscal 2007. This commitment to preserving our core coffee also extends to ongoing education around sustainable coffee practices and our tireless effort -- our tireless support and efforts of our coffee farmers.", "You may have recently seen Starbucks in the media with respect to Ethiopia and trademark issues. We support the recognition of the source of our coffees and have a deep appreciation of the farmers that grow them. In fact between 2002 and 2006, Starbucks increased its Ethiopian coffee purchases by nearly 400%. Starbucks has recently asked to support a licensing agreement and the trademark in names used for growing coffee in the coffee area in Ethiopia. Starbucks has never filed an opposition to Ethiopian government's trademark application. We have proposed certification as an alternative solution. We are committed to working collaboratively with key stakeholders to find a solution that supports Ethiopian coffee farmers. We stand true to our core and recognize that coffee is important to our continued growth.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Howard.", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, Jim. My remarks today will focus on two areas, an overview of our international business and a look at recent developments in our music and entertainment strategy. Our international business continues to be a key focal point for the company. We have and will remain focused on building upon our solid foundation with a goal to continue to expand our store base through our entry into new markets. We also seek opportunities to further leverage the brand by introducing products outside Starbucks retail locations, something we have had great success with in the US.", "During fiscal 2006, we continued to focus on hiring and building strong teams throughout our international business, making relevant connections with local communities, providing legendary service to our customers around the world and increasing our equity stake in several key markets.", "Fiscal year 2006 results reflect the progress that we have made with total international net revenues increasing 32% to $1.4 billion, and operating income growing 33% to $115 million. Overall, we now have more than 3600 stores in 36 countries outside the US. We have opened a record number of locations during the year, 665 to be exact, and we achieved several significant milestones during the year.", "Canada now has more than 680 locations, Japan reached 650 stores, UK store count now exceeds 500 locations, and there are more than 430 stores throughout our greater China region. And, this is just the beginning. We have tremendous opportunities to continue growing in existing markets and now have worked diligently over the past year to ready ourselves for entry into several new and key markets within the coming year. Our solid financial performance during a time of rapid growth is truly exceptional and further encourages us to capitalize on the immense growth opportunities that lie ahead for Starbucks.", "Before I move on, I would like to highlight our recent launch of the Starbucks card in the U.K. Beginning this week, our customers in the United Kingdom are now able to purchase, reload, and register Starbucks cards at more than 500 Starbucks locations. The initial response was very, very strong on the first day. One enthusiastic customer purchased 30 cards in one transaction. This response suggests that the Starbucks card will be a very popular gift item in the U.K. and just as successful and well accepted as it has been in North America. In fact, we have already had to order more cards to supply for the strong demand in anticipation of the holiday season.", "Now, moving on to a discussion around the growth opportunities available to us, not only through entering new markets or opening new stores but also through opportunistically increasing our equity ownership where and when appropriate. During fiscal 2006, we took advantage of the opportunity to acquire the remaining 95% ownership of our operations of both Hawaii and Puerto Rico. These acquisitions provide us with greater influence over the Starbucks brand and will allow us to focus on continued operational efficiencies and growth in these markets.", "We began fiscal 2007 with the acquisition of a 90% interest in our Beijing operations. This represents our continued commitment to invest in what we believe could be the single largest market outside of the United States. This will allow us to leverage the infrastructure investments we've put in place over the last year to lead the greater China market in building a consistent operating platform and delivering the Starbucks experience to our customers in Beijing.", "Our increased equity ownership further demonstrates our commitment to China, and through this transaction, we hope to accelerate our expansions plans within this market. As the second largest city in China, boasting a population of more than 11 million people, Beijing is a key market for Starbucks.", "Now, let me highlight up coming new market entries. Later this month, we will open our first Starbucks store in Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial and industrial center.  We recognize there is already a thriving coffee culture in Brazil, and we look to introduce the local Brazilian communities to our unique coffee experience. Brazil is an important market for Starbucks not only because it is a source for high quality arabica coffee beans but also because it's a market with many growth opportunities for the retail sector as a whole.", "We will also open our first Starbucks store in Cairo, Egypt by the end of the calendar year, which is another notable milestone, because this will be our first entry into Africa. Not only is Cairo the capital of Egypt and the largest city in the Middle East and in Africa, it also has a rich coffee history, coffee culture with consumers interested in the right mix of ambiance and products. We believe the Starbucks experience will provide just that to the people of Cairo. The Starbucks brand continues to attract more and more interest from communities around the world, which is a reflection of the power of the brand and it's relevancy to so many different cultures.", "It's the continued high level of community interest coupled with the strong financial performance we delivered today that gave us the confidence to raise our long-term international store count total to at least 20,000 locations in markets outside of the US. With more than 3,600 locations today, we have a tremendous runway for growth in international markets in the years ahead.", "Now, let me provide you with an update on the results of our initial project in the movie segment of our music and entertainment business, and then I will review more recent initiatives in the overall entertainment category. As you know, through unique marketing efforts in our retail stores, Starbucks was involved in the theatrical release of Akeelah and the Bee. And we were happy to report that following the film's release, we experienced great success with the sale of the DVD in our stores. In fact, Starbucks ranked among the top four brick and mortar retailers of selling Akeelah and the Bee. Our combined four-week market share for the end of the fiscal year was approximately 9%.", "Moving now to our entry into literature. You will recall that during the fourth quarter, we announced the next phase of our entertainment strategy, the integration of books into our overall entertainment offering. Our first selection was a novel by acclaimed author Mitch Albom titled \"For One More Day\". We began the nationwide promotion of the novel on October 3 with in-store appearances by Mitch in eight markets. Coinciding with that was the first-ever Starbucks Book Break where customers in 32 markets were able to share their thoughts and connect with one another through meaningful discussions of the universal themes of the book. Our role in the promotion of For One More Day was truly successful. Sales of the book in our stores have exceeded our expectations. The book has been a New York Times' Bestseller as well and as a result of the success and the continued demand on a national level for the book, we will continue to sell the book through the Christmas holiday.", "Reflecting on that success with both the book and the film, one point I would like to highlight to you that you are probably nor aware of, and that is that Starbucks in both cases of the DVD and in the book sold these products at full retail price at a time when these categories are being heavily discounted by other retailers. Yet, we were able to maintain full gross margin on these items, I think once again creating an opportunity for us, which our customers really do trust, the editorial voice of our company.", "Now, moving on to the music component of Starbucks Entertainment. Last month, we released a new CD from Ray Charles. That's right. You heard me correctly. A new CD from Ray Charles appeared in our stores last month. Starbucks Entertainment teamed up again with Concord Records to co-release and co-market Ray Sings, Basie Swings, a new album that marries never before released Ray Charles recordings with brand new performances by the Count Basie Orchestra. After a strong first week of sales at Starbucks and traditional retailers, this album debuted at number 23 on the Billboard Top 200 albums chart and has been -- and has remained there since its release. Starbucks locations account for more than one half of all copies of this album in America.", "Our newest initiative partners Hear Music with iTunes, an innovative partnership providing online access to our popular Hear Music titles; iTunes users now have the ability to preview, buy and download a wide variety of tunes from Hear Music's library. The Starbucks Entertainment area and iTunes marks the first time that Apple has allowed editorial guidance in content from another brand that has been developed by a partner to appear with the iTunes store. Bridging the gap between product in our stores and the digital consumer, we are now looking forward to such opportunities as marketing programs that link physical CDs sales in our stores to unique content online. This puts Starbucks in a great position to create true entertainment destination with the next stop in our digital strategy. We're excited to be working with Apple and iTunes on this innovative buying experience which will provide our customers the ability to take Starbucks Hear Music tunes with them wherever they go. The success we have had with music, film and literature and more recently our iTunes collaboration demonstrates that Starbucks has truly transformed the way our customers discover and acquire quality entertainment options providing an enriching experience to both them and our partners.", "Starbucks has a unique place in the daily lives of our customers and we highly value the trust our customers have placed in us. We embrace the opportunity to be part of their entertainment discovery and we are committed to selecting music, movie or literature projects that will represent the quality and substance reflective of the Starbucks brand and experience. This is the same approach we apply throughout our business, seeking products, channels and opportunities that enrich the daily lives of our customers.", "In closing, as I reflect on the ten years since we opened our first international store, we have worked diligently over that time, building a solid foundation for our international business, which will allow us to capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us. Just look at what we have accomplished. We have entered 36 countries outside the US. We have more than 3,600 stores in international markets at fiscal year end with nearly 50 more opened in the last month. Over that decade, we acquired full equity ownership in six markets and increased our equity ownership position in seven JV markets.", "While I am talking about expansion, let's not forget about store development. It was not that long ago following a great deal of planning and thoughtful review that we began speaking to you about extending our store development strategy to opening drive-thru locations in America. Now just a short time later, we have also expanded drive-thrus to several of our international markets, again demonstrating the strengths of the brand, which allowed us to extend a relatively new Starbucks concept to our global customers. We now have approximately 100 international drive-thru locations including stores in Canada, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Puerto Rico, Jordon, Australia and Indonesia. In fact, just last month, a near record number of customers joined us for the opening of our newest drive-thru in Monterrey, Mexico. In a very short period of time, it has become the gathering place in the neighborhood. It's often packed from noon to closing in the late evening. It wasn\u2019t that long ago, that we questioned whether or not we could extend the drive-thru strategy to international markets. Would drive-thrus appeal to customers outside of America? Today, we are extremely encouraged by the strong customer adoption of these stores, so early on, in the development of our international business.", "Also of note, within this decade, we have made significant inroads in extending the brand beyond our retail stores, by introducing ready-to-drink beverages in several Asia Pacific markets, and that is just one of the many opportunities to further leverage our strong brand equity and monetize the equity of Starbucks brand outside of our stores.", "Think about that, 10 years ago we had no presence outside in North America. Today, Starbucks has established a worldwide appeal not only for our coffee, but the physical environment we have created within our stores. I believe one would be hard for us to find another US based retailer that has accomplished this much and achieve this much in such a short period of time. The level of global acceptance, which Starbucks has achieved, is really, really significant. While this company has come a long away in a very short period of time, I truly believe we are still in the early stages of growth. We have a strong business model, which has continued to deliver strong returns to our shareholders and we have great confidence in the long-term global potential for Starbucks.", "With that Michael Casey.", "Michael Casey", "Thank you, Howard. This afternoon, I will provide highlights of our financial performance for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. However, before I get into the details, I think I should clarify and put into perspective what appears to be some confusion about with the initial reading of our press release today. There are several net income numbers reported, and I would like to line each of them up with how we look at.", "The bottom line for the fourth quarter was earnings per share of $0.15, but that included $0.02 per share of a new accounting principle FIN 47 for asset retirement liability. If you take that out or you back up above that, the earnings per share would have been $0.17 a share or about $134.5 million. That\u2019s 18.7% growth over the previous year, but when we look at our business on an apples-to-apples basis, we also exclude the impact of SFAS 123R or the accounting for equity-based compensation. And if you added back the $0.02 per share related to that, our earnings per share would have been $0.19 per share and the net income would be $152 million or 22.8% above the previous year, which is the way we look at the business, from an operational point of view.", "For both the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2006, our revenue growth continued to be very robust. Consolidated net revenues grew 21% for the quarter and 22% for the year. Company-operated retail revenues increased 22% for both the quarter and the full year, driven by the opening of 1,040 new company-owned retail stores in the last 12 months, and comparable store sales growth of 5% for the quarter and 7% for the full year.", "Specialty revenues grew 16% for the quarter and 23% for the year, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,159 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months.", "Before I move on to reviewing other financial highlights, let me mention three items that had an impact on our reported results in the fourth quarter: stock-based compensation expense, the adoption of new accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations, and the effect of certain tax items.", "As we have discussed in previous quarters the company adopted new expensing requirements for stock-based compensation at the beginning of 2006 with no restatement of prior period results. The pre-tax stock-based compensation expense recognized for the fourth quarter was $27 million or $17.5 million net of tax for an EPS impact of $0.02 per diluted share.", "For the full year of 2006, stock-based compensation was $69 million net of tax or $0.09 per share. Please refer to page 7 of the press release for a breakout of how this expense is allocated in our consolidated statement of earnings.", "Next, as we discussed last quarter, new accounting requirements from the FASB related to asset retirement obligations known as FIN 47 were adopted by the company at the end of fiscal 2006. For Starbucks as for other retailers with large numbers -- with a large number of leased store locations, these costs are for the estimated future expense of remodeling leasehold improvement at the termination of the lease. A cumulative effect of this accounting change was $17.2 million net of tax or $0.02 per diluted share. Beginning in fiscal 2007, this accounting requirement will be reflected in the company's financial statements and will not have a material impact on the company's results.", "Now turning to the tax items. As I have mentioned several times in the past, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are much more likely now than they used to be. For the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 33.2% compared to 38.1% for the same period in fiscal 2005. For the full year of 2006, the effective tax rate was 35.8% compared to 37.9% for 2005. The decline in the fourth quarter was due to recognition of the full-year benefit of a shift in the mix of expected profitability to lower tax international markets and increased effectiveness of the company's long-term tax planning strategies, as well as several favorable audit settlements, closures, and adjustments. In addition, there was a valuation allowance recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, which resulted in a higher effective tax rate for that quarter.", "For the full year, the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the items mentioned above as well as to the settlement reported in the third quarter of 2006 of a multi-year income tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction, for which Starbucks had established a contingent liability.", "Now, I would like to elaborate further on our operating results. Operating income was $198 million in the fourth quarter compared to $197 million in the prior year. As a percentage of net revenues, the operating margin declined to 9.9% from 11.8% in the prior period. Excluding $27 million of stock-based compensation expense recognition in the fourth quarter of this year, operating income increased by 14.3% to $225 million, and the operating margin was 11.2%.", "Beyond the impact of stock-based compensation in the -- is the cumulative impact of various rising costs that we incurred during the period, a significant portion of which related to higher labor costs in our US retail business, which I will review later in the US segment discussion.", "For the full year 2006, operating income increased to $894 million from $781 million in fiscal 2006, and the operating margin was 11.5% compared to a record 12.3% in fiscal 2005.", "For the full year, the company\u2019s operating margin, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, improved 0.5% of revenues to 12.8%. Beginning in fiscal 2007, reported amounts for the current and prior period will be comparable with respect to stock-based compensation.", "Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.17 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to $0.16 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2005, excluding $0.02 cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 in 2006. For the full year, diluted earnings per share were $0.73, excluding $0.02 for the accounting change compared to $0.61 per share for fiscal 2005.", "So, in summary, in fiscal 2006, we once again delivered strong financial performance exceeding our 20% revenue growth target, generating same-store sales growth at the high end of our 3% to 7% range and delivering EPS growth significantly above our original target of $0.63 to $0.65 per share.", "Turning now to the operating segment's results for the fourth quarter. Total net revenues for our United States operating segment increased by 18% to $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Company-operated retail revenues grew 18% to $1.4 billion, primarily due to the opening of 801 new company-operated stores in the last 12 months, and comparable store sales growth of 5% for the quarter. The increase in comparable stores sales growth was comprised of a 4% increase in the number of customer transactions combined with 1% increase in the average value per transaction. US specialty revenues grew by 14% to $247 million in the fourth quarter. Within specialty revenues, licensing revenues increased 20% to $168 million, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 733 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months, and to a lesser extent, growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club businesses.", "Foodservice and other revenues increased 3% to $78 million, due mainly to the addition of new accounts in the U.S., bringing our total foodservice reach to approximately 15,000 accounts. The impact of the growth in foodservice revenues and other revenues was dampened by an unfavorable year-over-year comparison in other revenues, which included revenue from the sales of Ray Charles 'Genius Loves Company CD outside of Starbucks retail stores in the fourth quarter of 2005.", "U.S. store operating expenses as a percentage of related retail revenue increased to 43.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 from 41.5% in the prior year. The increase was primarily related to higher payroll expenditures for our U.S. retail stores, due to higher than ideal store staffing levels, the addition of more assistant store managers, and regional support positions and an increase in training hours for store partners and future store leaders. With our continued aggressive growth in retail stores, the investment in our future store leaders is absolutely paramount. Accordingly, at the end of fiscal 2006 we had assistant store managers in 77% of our company-operated stores, compared to 68% at the end of fiscal 2005. We have taken proactive steps to help mitigate rising store operating costs through the additional management focus on more effective store labor deployment and with our recent beverage and whole bean price increase. You should also note that the recognition of stock-based compensation expense increased payroll related expenditures in fiscal 2006 versus 2005.", "U.S. operating income increased to $240 million during the quarter from $239 million during the same period in fiscal 2005. The operating margin decreased to 15.2% of related revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 from 17.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The decrease was due primarily to the higher store operating expenses I just noted and to an increase in cost of goods sold, including occupancy costs. The cost of sales including occupancy costs increased primarily due to higher green coffee costs, a shift in retail sales mix to products with lower gross margins when compared with beverages as well as to higher utility and distribution costs, offset in part by favorable dairy costs. U.S. food revenues grew at a faster rate than overall revenue growth.", "Now moving to the international segment, international total revenues increased 36% to $381 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. International company-operated retail revenues increased 39% to $319 million in fiscal 2006, mainly due to the opening of 239 new company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, comparable store sales growth of 8% for the quarter and the conversion of Hawaii from a licensed market to a company-operated market. The comparable store sales increase resulted from a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions, coupled with a 3% increase in average value per transaction. International specialty revenues for the quarter increased 24% to $62 million, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 426 licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and due to sales of ready-to-drink products in Japan, Taiwan and Korea.", "Operating income for international operations decreased to $28 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 from $30 million in fiscal 2005. The operating margin decreased to 7.4% of related revenues from a record fourth quarter of 10.9% in fiscal 2005. This decrease was primarily due to lower reported income from the company's equity investees, higher store operating expenses, as well as higher other operating expenses, offset in part by lower cost of sales including occupancy. The decrease in equity investee income was primarily due to accounting corrections, totaling $4.1 million made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 for two of our international joint venture markets.", "The increase in store operating expenses and other operating expenses was due to higher payroll expenditures for additional employees to support global expansion, particularly in our Asia-Pacific, China and EMEA markets and due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense. Lower cost of sales, including occupancy, were due primarily to leverage gains from fixed costs distributed over an expanded revenue base as well as favorable dairy costs, offset in part by higher green coffee costs.", "It bears repeating past comments that our ongoing investment in our international infrastructure, including investments in emerging markets, will continue and can be expected to cause variability in future quarterly operating margins. Our overall business model is based on strong revenue growth and moderate margin improvement over the long term, an approach that requires initial infrastructure buildout.", "Returning now to the consolidated business, during the fourth quarter, the company repurchased 14.6 million shares of Starbucks' stock at a cost of approximately $474 million under authorized share repurchase programs. For the full year, 25.6 million shares were repurchased for a cost of $828 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2001, Starbucks has returned over $2.3 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of approximately 100 million shares through October 1, 2006. Our strong balance sheet, continued strong operating cash flows, and the borrowing capacity under our $1 billion revolver provide the company significant financial strength and flexibility. This allows us to continue to build and maintain our expanding store base, reinvest into the brand through equity ownership stakes in new markets, and equity contributions to existing JV markets, selectively invest in new growth opportunities, such as China, Brazil, Russia and India, and to repurchase shares. We also continue to improve our return on equity, which reached 25% in fiscal 2006 from 20% in fiscal 2005 and 17% in fiscal 2004.", "Let me wrap up by reminding you that Starbucks has a solid track record of delivering on its aggressive financial growth targets. We have a strong business model that consistently drives approximately 20% top-line revenue growth, primarily through retail revenue growth in our company-operated stores. Our track record of 15 years of 5% or greater same-store sales growth is clearly among the best-in-class for retailers. And our revenue growth is complemented by our specialty revenues, which are primarily driven by our licensed stores. We believe that our unique business model, global presence, and strong brand recognition are all key competitive advantages. Those factors, as well as the immense opportunities that lie ahead of us, provide us the confidence to set our sights on aggressive targets for 2007. These include opening 2400 new stores, approximately 20% top-line growth, same-store sales growth in the 3% to 7% range, and earnings per share growth of approximately 20% to 25%.", "As you all know, the first half of fiscal 2006 resulted in particularly strong earnings growth, so it is important to keep in mind quarterly comparisons in the first half will be more challenging than the second half of fiscal 2007.", "With that I would like to now ask the operator to queue up the first question. Please ask one question at a time, and re-queue for additional questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from John Glass with CIBC.", "John Glass - CIBC", "Thanks. Michael, it sounded like maybe the higher store level labor in the U.S. was a surprise to you in the quarter. Is there any way to quantify how much margin pressure came from the growth spending rather than maybe just ambient cost pressures? Maybe you could just look forward, how much of the price increase will -- how much of that will be covered by the price increase as you go forward the next couple of quarters?", "Michael Casey", "I would say that less than half of the margin pressure in the store operating expenses or approximately half, to be conservative, was due to issues within the store and the other half was growth related. And we believe that we're taking the steps both with regard to labor deployment and as a benefit -- and with the benefits of the price increase to offset that part of the margin pressure.", "John Glass - CIBC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Lehman Brothers.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Great. Thank you. I have a question on margins.  I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the cost of sales negatively impacted by the shift in sales to products with low gross margins. Obviously, as you continue to grow your business in the areas other than coffee I would expect this trend to continue.  Just wondering your thoughts on that and specifically how we should think about cost of sales as we look out to fiscal '07 for both U.S. and international.  Thanks.", "Michael Casey", "I'll take that question.  I think the important thing to remember is that I was talking about the cost of sales including occupancy line, when I made that comment. And so, the nature of the non-beverage products are that they have lower gross margins, but they have much less labor activity associated with them. So at the store level, we are equally profitable whether we sell an extra dollar of beverages or an extra dollar of either food or merchandise or entertainment products. So, the pressure is related to the gross margin line, not to the store contribution line. I think that\u2019s the most important aspect of that. In the US, we expect -- for the total company, we are expecting approximately flat gross margins year-over-year, 2007 versus 2006. If you break it down by segment, we do expect to continue to see some improvement in the international segment as we get an increasing number of stores utilizing the infrastructure that has been built and is continuing to be built in the international market.", "Jim Donald", "And to repeat the plan for '07, the increase in warming and lunch is baked into our numbers that we are looking at going forward.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bear Stearns.", "Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Thank you. First is the clarification on the last one. Mike, did you say you expect the gross margins in the US to be flat or the store level margins?", "Michael Casey", "We think the -- we expect the gross margins year-over-year to be approximately flat in '07 versus '06.", "Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Okay. And then just a question on G&A in the quarter and a question on the tax rate going forward, just a full year expectation, just the G&A in the quarter looked -- particularly on the US side, very well-contained, very low. There is a couple of things mentioned in the release, but can you just talk a little bit about that and what your thoughts are going forward on that line? And then again as I suggest your full-year tax expectations for '07?", "Michael Casey", "Over our 3 to 5 years strategic planning horizon, we expect the primary driver of total company margin improvement to be G&A leverage. We expect to maintain our operating margins, perhaps make some improvement, not talking about it on a particular quarter, but on a year-over-year basis, modest improvement in operating margins. But as the business grows to get more significant improvement in the G&A lines and to some extent in the depreciation and amortization line, so that we get growth in total -- in total company operating margin. Within these individual segments, we expect to continue to get operating margin improvement within international, but not so much so within our family of US businesses.", "The tax rate, as I mentioned leading to that, the tax rate used to be a lot easier to predict when it was done on a longer-term basis. The current requirements with regard to tax, is that every specific event that happens triggers a specific change in that period. So there are going to be more fluctuation in the tax rate. And, so we are still targeting the 38% effective tax rate that we've targeted in the past. But we are encouraged that some of our long-term tax planning activities and the increasing contribution to profit made by our international business over the long term will give us improvement in the effective tax rate. But it won't be every quarter and it won't be dramatic in the short term.", "Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Kron with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Great, thanks. Can I just quickly ask a follow-up on that G&A question? In the press release, Michael, as it talks about the lower provision for incentive compensation, just wondering if you can just put a little bit more color around that? And, then my question is more balance sheet related, I don\u2019t think in the release there was balance sheet information, can you tell us how much cash you had at year-end and did you tap into the revolver during the quarter? Thanks.", "Michael Casey", "Well, I will answer to the cash question first. We reduced our -- I believe we reduced our borrowings during the quarter and we expect to further reduce our borrowings during the very strong operating first quarter in G&A. Well if you look at the operating results of our business, they weren\u2019t as strong in the fourth quarter of this year as they were in the fourth quarter of last year, looking at strictly an operating point of view. And, so we have a performance-based incentive comp program and because the business wasn't quite as strong, we had a lower accrual for incentive compensation related to the business in the fourth quarter.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And do you have that cash balance as of year-end?", "Michael Casey", "We didn\u2019t issue the balance sheet because we are still finalizing the details of FIN 47 as it related to the balance sheet but the cash and cash equivalents were about $313 million.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thanks.", "Michael Casey", "I'm sorry, to correct what I said before, the borrowings at the end of the year were $700 million versus about $300 million at the end of last year. But we have paid that down subsequent to the end of the quarter and would expect to continue so during the very strong first fiscal quarter of the year.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Michael Casey", "You're welcome. Operator?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Palmer with UBS", "David Palmer - UBS", "Hey guys. You mentioned 3,500 stores, I think by next year with breakfast versus about 1,000 now. I think that's what you said and if that's true that would maybe 800 or more per quarter. Is the ramp up going to be smooth like that or is there going to be a ramp up in deployment? Could you perhaps give us a sense of the timetable? And separately, could you give us a sense of may be how breakfast is going in new markets where you deploy it? Are you seeing the same sort of 30,000 per store lift that you are seeing in some markets early on or are you perhaps seeing a bit better performance these days?", "Jim Donald", "On average, it is around the 30,000, may be a shade north of that. If you take -- if you dive down to the markets, each market has differently based upon the time it has been in the marketplace. But when we look at the launch, we have to -- it's no different than we launched this from the inception. We are taking a balanced approach on a quarter-by-quarter basis and putting again this all into our \u201907 plan, the resources in place that we don't affect the in-store experience with the speed of service that the sandwich -- the warming sandwich that our customers get are up to our own and their expectations. So, this is something that we are doing over the course of the entire year on a balanced approach.", "David Palmer - UBS", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia, with William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair", "Hi, good afternoon. Can you talk about the reaction of customers to the price increase you took here in the US and also in Japan? And where you think the effective price benefit will fall out or comp here in the US?", "Howard Schultz", "This is Howard. I will start Japan. I just came back from Japan. Our business there is quite good. It appeared that the price increase was relatively seamless in terms of the announcement and feel very comfortable on a go-forward basis.", "Jim Donald", "In the US, as I look across, all of our markets, all of our regions, we basically see the same -- are seeing the same thing, a seamless transition over to a small increase and customers continuing to frequent our stores on a same or a higher transaction comp basis.", "Michael Casey", "And the impact of the price increase is included in our 3% to 7% same store sales guidance.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Matt DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thanks. With respect to margins and on the international side in the text of the release you say accounting corrections totaling 4.1 million were in part attributed to the margin contraction on the international side, how should we look at that going forward as far as the direction of margins internationally, especially the first half given the heady year-ago comparisons?", "Michael Casey", "You should not expect the accounting corrections to occur -- to reoccur. That has -- that was a one-time event that we don't expect to happen again. So, that part of it is not -- would not be repeated. I don't want to predict the youth -- the international market -- margins on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but as you want to reiterate that we expect over any sort of trailing 12 month period compared to previous trailing 12 month period that there would be noticeable improvement. But the rate at which we enter new markets, the activity within the various markets can cause some quarters to be up and some quarters to be down over the next several years as we move forward.", "Q1 last year was extraordinarily strong, and so that might be one that I wouldn't expect to surpass, but I don't want to get in the business of trying to predict segment margins on a quarter-by-quarter basis in a business that we know is going to be lumpy and it's going to be a challenge to balance the need to build the infrastructure for the tremendous opportunity that's ahead us versus the also-important need to continue to be increasingly profitable.", "Matt DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, I guess also I had a clarification and want to make sure did you say that the price increase is going to in the US meet and offset the cost pressures that are causing some of the margin pressures and therefore hold restaurant level margin flat?", "Michael Casey", "Well I didn't go that far, I said that the price increase should have a beneficial effect on the labor pressure that we had in the fourth quarter. There are all kinds of other things that are going on in the business and I am not prepared to predict what the margins are going to be in the first quarter.", "Matt DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glen Petraglia with Citigroup.", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Thanks. Michael, if you could maybe give an outlook for green coffee prices as well as the company\u2019s use of fixed price versus price to be fixed contract in 2007 and how that compares to 2006. That will be great. Thanks.", "Michael Casey", "Okay. Basically the last couple of years we have been seeing increasing green coffee prices and we have in the third quarter of this year and in the fourth quarter of this year we had approximately  10% higher green coffee costs in the current period than we did in the previous period. The good news -- well, sort of the bad news is that the near term and the near and the future contract prices in the market place have gone up in the last two or three weeks fairly noticeably. But the good news in that story is that we are basically bought 18 months ahead and that we have done essentially  -- the vast majority, 90% of the purchasing that we need to do in this current 12-month period has been accomplished in the August, September, early October time frame. So, our purchases were ahead of the recent run up so I don\u2019t expect any surprises whatsoever in green coffee. And I do expect our absolute costs to level over the next 12 months and the comparisons will get better as the prior year green coffee costs come up underneath the fairly flat level that we are going to experience for the next twelve months.", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Dan Geiman with McAdams Wright Ragen.", "Dan Geiman - McAdams Wright Ragen", "Good afternoon. I guess, excluding like green coffee, which you just talked about, what are your assumptions as far as commodity prices and other inputs heading into the coming year? Where do you see the primary pressure points? Where do you see some areas of opportunities as well?", "Michael Casey", "We currently have seek favorability in the diary complex and the milk products that we buy, although I have caveat that with the fact that they can change rather rapidly and we are not hedged with regard to dairy, but currently we are getting favorable comparisons in dairy. I think the negative aspect will continue at least in the first half of this year related to energy. As we compare against periods when the energy costs were not quite so high in the first half of last year and when a number of our vendors, landlord, other business partners, had not fully passed through energy cost increases to us.", "Dan Geiman - McAdams Wright Ragen", "Thank you.", "Michael Casey", "Thank you.", "Operator", "That was our final question. Do you have any closing remarks?", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Yes, thank you. Thank you all for joining us for the earnings call today and we hope you will back with us for the webcast of our fiscal first quarter 2007 financial results on Wednesday, January 31, 2007.

This is JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations at Starbucks Coffee Company. With me today are Howard Schultz, Chairman; Jim Donald, President and CEO; Michael Casey, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kelly Hall, Vice President, Corporate Finance.

", "The company assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements. ", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Jim. ", "James L. Donald", "Thanks, JoAnn. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am very pleased to review our results following another strong quarter for Starbucks. Let me recap some of the key financial highlights, which we reported today: Net revenues for the first quarter were $2.4 billion, up 22% from last year; Comparable store sales grew 6%, and was composed of a 4% increase in the number of transactions and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction; Net earnings for the first quarter were $205 million, compared to $174 million in fiscal 2006; and earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.26, compared to $0.22 in fiscal 2006. ", "These results, all well within our fiscal 2007 financial targets, follow an exceptionally strong fiscal 2006 first quarter. We recognize that the outstanding first half of fiscal 2006 created tough year-over-year comparisons for both quarter one and quarter two. And as quarter one proved, we were up to the challenge, delivering solid results. ", "Contributing to our financial results during the quarter was the opening of a record 728 new stores -- that\u2019s a little over eight stores a day. This number represents the most stores opened during one quarter in Starbucks history! By the end of the fiscal period, we were serving our customers nearly 44 million times per week at 13,168 locations in 39 countries. ", "Throughout today\u2019s call you will hear that our strategic roadmap is built on a balanced approach to rapid growth and targeted investments. We will talk about investments we have made in our partners, our infrastructure and in our coffee procurement. I believe these investments, balanced with our aggressive growth targets, will enable our strong management team to remain focused on leading the Company in a direction that will build strong shareholder value well into the future. ", "Now I\u2019ll review some of the key drivers behind our first quarter results, starting with our U.S. business. Because U.S. Company-operated retail represents nearly 90% of U.S. revenues, that\u2019s where I will focus my remarks. ", "Our strong 21% U.S. retail revenue growth was generated by record store openings and solid comparable store sales growth of 6%. Handcrafted beverages, including core and seasonal holiday offerings, as well as food and merchandise all contributed to same store sales growth. ", "Our food program again this quarter was a significant contributor to our U.S. retail revenues. These offerings are complementary to our core and seasonal beverages and are meeting our customers\u2019 demands as evidenced by strong sales. We have remained focused on expanding our lunch program which is now offered in more than 4,100 Starbucks locations in the U.S. This is an increase of approximately 860 stores compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2006, which represents 69% of our Company-operated U.S. retail stores. ", "And, we expect over time that nearly all our Company-operated U.S. retail stores will offer the lunch program. As a reminder, this program adds approximately $30,000 in average annual sales to stores offering lunch items. ", "During the first quarter, we significantly expanded the number of stores offering warmed breakfasts by adding more than 200 locations in New York and approximately 90 locations in Indiana, as well as adding over 260 stores in existing markets through infill. ", "At the end of the first quarter nearly 1,200 Starbucks locations were offering warmed breakfast items, compared to only 225 stores a year ago. Based on the strong customer acceptance we have experienced, we have aggressive plans to continue rolling out our Warming platform over the next few years. We expect over time that most of our Company-operated U.S. retail stores will offer the Warming program. Warmed sandwiches add approximately $35,000 in incremental average annual sales to these stores. ", "Merchandise also contributed to same store sales growth during the first quarter. Customers had the opportunity to purchase coffee-relevant merchandise as well as holiday treats perfect for the gift-giving season. ", "And what would the Holiday season be without the Starbucks Card? I am happy to tell you that again this year the Starbucks Card -- the cornerstone of our holiday gift program -- proved to be extremely popular. During the first quarter, customers activated nearly 20 million cards representing a value of nearly $300 million. This is an increase of approximately 30% in both activations and value when compared to the first quarter of last year. At the end of the quarter, approximately $410 million was loaded onto Starbucks Cards waiting to be redeemed, a 40% increase compared to $293 million at the end of the first quarter last year. ", "Since the introduction of the Starbucks Card, more than 115 million cards have been ", " activated. After more than five years, the Starbucks Card has proven to be one of the most highly demanded cards in the marketplace. It has not only created a loyal following among our current customer base, but it continues to draw new customers into our stores, and it\u2019s our premium beverages, legendary service and unique Starbucks Experience that keeps them coming back. The strong growth of accounts, the stickiness our card creates with our customers, and the frequency of use clearly separates us from other programs. ", "Over the years, we have sought out opportunities to integrate the Starbucks Card into our in-store promotional campaigns around the seasons and holidays. During fiscal year 2007, you will see us expand our promotional efforts even further as we introduce programs to build customer awareness of the Starbucks Card as a year-round special gift for birthdays, special occasions, holidays, or just because. ", "Let me now shift from the U.S. to our newest reporting segment, which spans a broader geography: our Global Consumer Products Group. ", "The unique aspect of this business is that Starbucks was able to develop an entirely new distribution channel for our products outside our retail stores -- something never really done to this extent before by restaurateurs, retailers or other consumer brands. We have been able to leverage our retail products and, on a parallel track, we created a channel as vibrant and robust as our retail stores. ", "Not only is it a very cost effective and profitable channel, but it also provides Starbucks with the opportunity to reach a wider consumer base, building customer awareness and providing additional brand touch points. ", "The mission of CPG is to extend the Starbucks Experience to our customers whenever they want it and wherever they happen to be -- at home, in the office, or on the road. In other words, anywhere outside of their Starbucks store. ", "This is achieved through business partnerships with both domestic and international companies who provide distribution and marketing for this broad array of products. In these relationships, Starbucks provides roasted coffee, as a key ingredient for a variety of coffee-based products and finished products, such as packaged coffee. Starbucks manages the brand integrity and through these partnerships, we are able to leverage our business partners\u2019 manufacturing and distribution capabilities. ", "CPG is made up primarily of: Packaged Coffee & Tea and Ready-to-Drink coffee products in both domestic and international markets, as well as ice cream in the U.S. Through our CPG channel in the U.S. market, last year alone we connected with our customers approximately 550 million additional times outside our retail stores. ", "Our Consumer Products Group introduced Starbucks branded coffees into our International Club distribution channel in two new countries, Korea and the U.K., expanding the distribution to four countries. This provides more opportunities to extend the brand in non-retail locations outside the U.S. ", "In Korea, we added Starbucks DoubleShot to the product offerings following the introduction of bottled Starbucks Frappuccino to this market in fiscal 2006. Customer acceptance of these products has been very encouraging and sales volumes continue to rise. ", " We are still in the early stages of development in our Consumer Products Group, both domestically and internationally, and with many new, innovative products in the pipeline and opportunities to extend our products to new channels, we are very excited about this business. ", "At Starbucks, we are constantly looking for ways to broaden our appeal to our customer demographic by offering products that range from indulgent treats to health conscious choices. Today, our customers are able to choose from tens of thousands of possible beverage combinations, allowing them to customize their drink specifically for them. The quality of our offerings will always be our top priority and a point of differentiation for us. ", "As an innovator, we are always looking at our products to ensure we remain ahead of the curve. Now, while that\u2019s not new for Starbucks, in the spirit of that effort, I am proud to say that during the first quarter, we made significant advances with the introduction of zero grams trans fat food offerings in 50% of our U.S. Company-operated stores. We are working with our regional bakers to move closer to our goal of offering food with zero grams trans fat in 100% of our U.S. Company-operated locations. We are also actively engaged with our licensed store partners and are aiming to have all licensed stores in the U.S. hit the zero trans fat gram target as well. ", "Internationally, we are making great strides in reducing trans fats in multiple markets. For instance, in both Canada and China we expect to see substantial reductions in trans fat content this year. Providing our customers with quality products that meet their needs is just one way we fuel ongoing revenue growth within our retail business. ", "Our winter promotion also embraces this health and wellness direction by bringing back a customer favorite from last year, Cinnamon Dolce Latte, and providing the option for our customers to order it as a sugar-free beverage. Additionally, we are featuring two new whole grain pastries: Five-Fruit Banana Muffin and Reduced Fat Cinnamon Chip Mini Loaf. ", "Following our winter promotion, we have an exciting Spring campaign commencing in early April built around a celebration of the Latin American culture. We will feature innovative new beverages and pastry items along with some of the finest Latin American coffees. ", "Before I close, I would like to touch on an important aspect of the Starbucks brand: our coffee procurement practices. They are built around our commitment to pay premium prices for high quality coffee, which not only serves the short- and long-term economic interests of coffee farmers and suppliers, it also serves Starbucks needs by creating an incentive for farmers to improve quality and increase production. That in turn contributes to a more sustainable supply of the high-quality coffee we depend on to support future growth in our business and in shareholder value. ", "Looking forward, we continue to believe we have a long runway for future growth. This growth opportunity is largely due to the hard work, dedication and support of all of our partners throughout the organization. With that in mind, in the first fiscal quarter, we implemented a broad-based wage increase for our hourly U.S. and Canadian retail partners, which represents the majority of our employee base. And in the second quarter, we are increasing wage rates for our store management team. ", "The work environment and benefits Starbucks provides its partners are very important to us, and it appears that those efforts have been recognized and are appreciated by our partners. Recently Starbucks was recognized for the 9th year as one of FORTUNE Magazine\u2019s \u201c100 Best Companies to Work For.\u201d Starbucks ranked number 16 this year and we were one of only three companies with more than 100,000 employees that made the list. In fact, Starbucks has more partners than the top nine rated companies combined. This recognition is a testament to the value of Starbucks culture. ", "With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Howard. ", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, Jim, nice job. Before I review our International business, I\u2019d like to take a minute to update you on Starbucks literary initiatives in our U.S. retail stores. As you know, in early October, Starbucks announced the integration of books into our overall Entertainment offerings. Our first selection was a novel by best-selling author Mitch Albom entitled For One More Day. Starbucks stores alone sold more than 92,000 copies through the beginning of January, which demonstrates the significant role our stores now play as a nontraditional bookseller. ", "This successful entry provided us encouragement to introduce another title, A Long Way Gone, to be featured in our retail stores. Beginning in early February, we will introduce first-time author Ishmael Beah who tells a powerful story of hope and redemption from the perspective of a child soldier\u2019s rare first-hand account of fighting as a boy in the war-torn country of Sierra Leone. ", "This is an inspirational memoir and we believe introduces millions of our customers to quality entertainment that not only supports new and emerging talent but also provides customers the opportunity to discover and discuss relevant new literary works. ", "Additionally, for every copy of A Long Way Gone in Starbucks stores that we sell, we will donate $2 to the United States fund for UNICEF, with a minimum donation of $100,000. UNICEF helps children around the world overcome obstacles of poverty, violence, disease and discrimination. UNICEF played a key role in the rehabilitation of Mr. Beah, and their mission aligns with our commitment to support communities in which we operate. ", "Now turning to our International business. Overall, International performance was driven by rapid retail store expansion and strong revenue and comparable store sales growth. International opened a record 223 stores during the quarter. Our international expansion has been driven by a focus on the core elements that create the Starbucks Experience for people around the world. ", "We have been very mindful of launching into new markets, choosing business partners that provide significant business expertise and have similar values. As we\u2019ve done numerous times in the past, we increase our equity ownership in markets where it makes good business sense. ", "Our experience in some of our established international markets continues to show us there is more potential than we originally believed possible. For example, Mexico and the Philippines are two great examples of markets that have surprised us in their acceptance of the Starbucks brand and their capacity for more stores in more cities. We opened in Mexico only four years ago and today there are 116 Starbucks stores in that country, which means that we\u2019ve opened an average of nearly 30 locations a year. ", "As for the Philippines, this was a market whose capacity we initially estimated at approximately 25 stores, yet here we are providing the Third Place experience in more than 100 stores, and still expanding. ", "Experiences like this make us highly confident that we will be able to meet our long-term goal of at least 20,000 locations in International markets. ", "Our commitment to Starbucks growth around the world is evidenced by continued strong store openings and market expansion. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, our International team continued their focus on respectfully building out existing markets, as well as opening locations in new markets and delivered a record number of new store openings, including two new countries: Brazil and Egypt. ", "Entry into these two countries had their own special significance: the rich Brazilian coffee culture was an attractive and natural fit for Starbucks, and the opening of Egypt represents our first entry into Africa. Both of these new market openings were greeted with an enthusiastic reception from these communities and the stores are doing very well in these initial months. ", "Turning to China, as you know this market is a top priority for us as we believe it can ultimately be one of our largest markets outside of the United States. I ended the calendar year with another visit to that country and while I was there, I visited numerous stores, our Greater China Support Center in Shanghai, and hosted several partner forums. I also delivered keynote addresses at three prestigious Universities: Shantou, Fudan and Beijing University to speak to business school students to both seed the brand with this important audience and, most importantly, to recruit some of the sharpest, youngest minds to come to work for Starbucks. ", "You may recall we began fiscal 2007 with the acquisition of a 90% interest in our Beijing operations. We are very enthusiastic and ready to take this market to the next level. Now, with managing control, we are able to begin utilizing some of our own infrastructure investments we\u2019ve put in place over the last year to lead the Greater China market in building a consistent operating platform and delivering legendary service to our customers. We see many unique opportunities to further enhance the Starbucks Experience in Beijing in preparation for the Summer Olympics in 2008. ", "We remain on track and very enthusiastic about our plans to enter Russia. We will open in that market with our long-time Middle Eastern partner, M.H. Alshaya. We first established a partnership with them in 1999 when we entered Kuwait, and we have since continued to build out additional markets in the region with them. Customers in Moscow will have the opportunity to enjoy the Starbucks Experience this calendar year. ", "And as we\u2019ve discussed with you in the past, we see great opportunities for Starbucks stores in India. We remain optimistic that we will be able to open doors to the first Starbucks location in India as well by the end of calendar 2007. ", "We are excited about the potential in all these new markets and look forward to the upcoming store openings. ", "In summary, on our International presence, we now have 3,767 stores in International locations. We still have a lot of growth ahead of us to reach our ultimate goal of 20,000 stores in International markets, and we are well on our way to hitting our aggressive store opening target for this fiscal year. This is just another affirmation of the tremendous global opportunity that Starbucks has around the world. ", "Beyond store expansion, some of you may remember that during our last quarterly conference call we spoke about the immediate success that we had at the launch of the Starbucks Card in the U.K. I just want to spend a few minutes talking about that. In fact, the Starbucks Card introduction resulted in such strong customer demand that we needed to place an emergency rush order on more cards during the first week of the launch. ", "I am happy to say that the success of the card continued through the holiday season with approximately 112,000 activations and nearly 50,000 reloads since the card was introduced during mid-November, which represents more than $3.8 million in activations and reloads in just over six weeks. ", "This is especially exciting for us because it wasn\u2019t long ago, as Jim mentioned in his remarks -- five years, in fact -- that Starbucks became a market leader with the introduction of the Starbucks value card concept in the United States. Since then, stored value cards have become increasingly popular throughout a wide variety of consumer businesses. ", "We have introduced a platform that can now be used across borders in the U.S., Canada, Greece, Australia, Thailand and the U.K., and beginning next month, we will add Hong Kong to that list with our planned launch of the Global Starbucks Card. ", "We have experienced the success of the Starbucks Card in the U.S. where it has created a loyal following. In fact, customers who use the Starbucks Card in the U.S. have told us that they visit our stores more frequently, spend more each time they visit and overall are more pleased with Starbucks after using the Card. We truly feel this same sentiment will travel very well to our International markets, especially with the introduction and expansion of the global card. ", "This platform gives Starbucks the opportunity to capture a wider base of loyal customers around the world and this is another way to make our Starbucks customers feel at home when they travel and are away from their local Starbucks. ", "As I look back on our results for the first quarter, I am confident that we have set the foundation for another solid year for Starbucks. I am very proud of the accomplishments we\u2019ve made during this quarter. The energy and passion I see throughout the Company on a daily basis truly inspires me and our partners and proves that our wage increase for our store partners was an appropriate priority, and I think once again shows the conscience and soul of the Company. Respected, valued, passionate partners working for our company impart that feeling to our customers, which we believe allows us to continue providing legendary service around the world and in turn delivers long-term shareholder value. ", "Our dedicated partners make Starbucks what it is today: a growth company with a globally recognized and respected brand. There continues to be a tremendous appetite, both internally and externally, for the growth and development of our company internationally, and to me, it\u2019s greater and clearer than ever before. ", "As I look ahead, I am confident that we have the ability to deliver on both our short-term and long-term aggressive international growth targets. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Michael Casey, who has got a bad cold, so bear with his hoarse voice. ", "Michael Casey", "Thank you, Howard. During today\u2019s call, I will provide additional detail on some of the significant factors impacting our financial performance for the first quarter and share with you my observations on the quarter as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. ", "Jim already recapped our 22% top line revenue growth and 6% comparable store sales results for the first quarter, so let me move directly to the consolidated operating income, which increased 14% to $320 million for the 13 weeks ended December 31, 2006, from $280 million in the prior year. As expected, operating margin decreased from a record 14.5% in the prior year to 13.6%, primarily due to higher cost of sales including occupancy costs and higher store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. Partially offsetting those higher costs were lower general and administrative expenses. ", "The increase in cost of sales including occupancy costs was driven by higher rent expense, a shift in sales to higher cost products and increased distribution costs. Store operating expenses increased primarily due to the investment in our U.S. and Canadian store partners through a wage increase. We are partially funding these wage increases through the October 2006 price increase and our decision not to hold a leadership conference this year, which was originally planned in the second quarter. ", "Training and leadership development continue to be a priority for us, however we believe we can support those efforts through other initiatives in fiscal 2007. We carefully prioritize investments in our business to ensure we are optimizing the benefit to the business, and believe allocating funds to our valued store partners in the form of wage increases was the best investment to make. ", "General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to higher charitable contributions in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and higher provisions for incentive compensation due to exceptional performance in the prior year. ", "These items were partially offset by increased payroll-related expenditures and higher professional fees in support of our continued global growth and systems infrastructure development in the current year. Also of note, G&A expense as a percent of total revenue for the quarter was at a historical low level, a result of strong revenue growth and controlled spending during the period. ", "And finally, earnings per share were $0.26 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to $0.22 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2006, an increase of 18%. ", "Turning now to our first quarter highlights from our operating segments. Beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006, as reported in our 10-K, we are now reporting a third segment, the Global Consumer Products Group, in addition to the United States and International segments. Segment information for the first-quarter of the prior year has been restated to reflect these changes. ", "Please note that we will provide comparable segment information for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 in mid-February. Until then, keep in mind that all previously published quarterly financial results reflect the Company\u2019s prior operating segment reporting structure. ", "Let me begin with the U.S. operating segment. Total net revenues increased by 20% to $1.9 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The opening of 928 new company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, and comparable store sales growth of 6% for the quarter, led to growth in Company-operated retail revenues of 21% to $1.7 billion for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was comprised of a 3% increase in the number of customer transactions combined with a 3% increase in the average value per transaction. ", "U.S. specialty revenues grew by 13% to $200 million in the first quarter. Within specialty revenues, licensing revenues increased 18% to $113 million, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 758 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. ", "Food service and other revenues increased 7% to $86 million, due mainly to the addition of new accounts and growth in existing accounts. ", "U.S. cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues increased to 39.3% compared to 39.0% in the comparable period a year ago, primarily due to a shift in the sales mix to higher cost products, higher rent expense and increased distribution costs. The increase in rent expense was due to the acceleration in our new store development pipeline, as we have increased the number of stores under construction incurring rent expense, and to several less significant factors. ", "The impact from a shift in sales reflects a growing percentage of sales from food in the past year, as we have expanded the number of stores offering lunch and, to a much lesser degree, expanded the Warming program. At the end of the first quarter, lunch was offered in 69% of our U.S. Company-operated retail stores compared to 59% a year ago. ", "Finally, increased distribution costs were primarily the result of higher fuel costs as well as expense associated with additional consolidated distribution centers to support our growing store base. ", "Store operating expenses grew primarily due to higher payroll expenditures as a result of a wage increase for the Company\u2019s hourly store partners. Investment in our valuable store partners through a wage rate increase was a top priority for the Company as we entered the new fiscal year and, with our continued aggressive growth in retail stores, as evidenced by the record number of store openings in the quarter, the investment in our future store leaders is also critical. ", "As I mentioned earlier in my comments on the consolidated results, we took proactive steps to help offset the rising store operating costs with our October 3, 2006 beverage and whole bean price increase in our retail stores. We also made the decision not to hold the leadership conference planned for 2007 to redirect those costs toward the wage increase. ", "Additionally, we have sharpened management focus on more effective store labor deployment through closer adherence to our standards, and we started to see the benefits as the first quarter progressed. ", "U.S. operating income increased to $325 million during the quarter from $298 million during the same period in fiscal 2006. The operating margin decreased to 17.5% of related revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 from 19.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2006, which was a record high for the U.S. operating margin. ", "Now moving to the International segment. International total net revenues increased 32% to $405 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. International Company-operated retail revenues increased 35%, to $347 million in the first quarter of 2007, mainly due to the opening of 249 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, comparable store sales growth of 8% for the quarter, and favorable foreign currency exchange for the British pound sterling and Canadian dollar. ", "The comparable store sales increase resulted from a 6% increase in the number of customer transactions coupled with a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. ", "International specialty revenues for the quarter increased 20% to $59 million, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 432 licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. ", "Operating income for International operations was $33 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to $34 million in fiscal 2006. The operating margin decreased to 8.2% of related revenues from a record first quarter level of 10.9% in fiscal 2006. This decrease was primarily due to higher cost of sales including occupancy costs. ", "Higher cost of sales including occupancy costs was primarily due to accounting corrections totaling $3.4 million, and to rising energy and fuel prices driving utilities rates and distribution costs higher. ", "Now let\u2019s move to our newest operating segment, the Global Consumer Products Group, or CPG as we commonly refer to it. Jim already provided an overview of the components of this business. However, before I review the results from this segment, let me briefly explain the unique economics of this business as compared to our U.S. and International segments. ", "CPG is a very profitable business for Starbucks. As you can see from the segment financials, this operating unit has much lower revenues than our U.S. and International segments, yet it contributes strong profits to the enterprise. A significant portion of this business is leveraged through our business partnerships with great companies such as Kraft, Pepsi, and others. These relationships allow us to leverage our partners\u2019 existing infrastructures and extend the Starbucks brand in an efficient way, resulting in a very modest cost structure within the Starbucks income statement. ", "Additionally, our joint venture partnerships, such as with Pepsi, are included on a net basis within the income from equity investees line, with no related revenue. ", "Now to review this segment\u2019s results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. CPG total net revenues increased 13% to $91 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. This increase was driven mainly by volume growth in the U.S. and International packaged coffee business through licensed grocery and warehouse club channels. I should point out that this 13% year-over-year revenue growth is compared with exceptionally strong sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2006, which benefited from production declines experienced by other coffee brands resulting from Hurricane Katrina. ", "Operating income for CPG was $42 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to $43 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2006. The operating margin decreased to 45.8% of related revenues from 52.9% in fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher cost of sales, lower income from equity investees and higher other operating expenses. ", "Cost of sales increased primarily due to the mix of revenues in the quarter. Our sales into Kraft Foods\u2019 distribution system does not directly align with their sales to the customer, which sometimes creates a timing shift between quarters in our recognition of associated revenue. ", "Income from equity investees declined primarily as a result of lower sales volumes for the Starbucks Ice Cream Partnership as well as the North American Coffee Partnership, which produces Starbucks ready-to-drink beverages, as previously mentioned. ", "In addition, other operating expenses increased primarily due to higher marketing expenditures in support of further development and expansion of ready-to-drink beverages in the Asia-Pacific region, where we first came to market in late fiscal 2005. ", "During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, Starbucks repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $130 million, and reduced the outstanding balance on our credit revolver by $335 million to $365 million outstanding. Our solid balance sheet, continuing strong cash flows and borrowing capacity allow us to continue to fund the growth of our existing business, selectively invest in new growth opportunities, such as our recent acquisition of 90% ownership in our Beijing operations, and opportunistically repurchase shares. ", "Before reviewing our full-year targets, I would like to point out four very positive indicators of ongoing strength coming out of the first quarter. ", "Number one, record quarterly store openings demonstrates the strength of our store development capabilities and the continued customer demand for Starbucks locations, both domestically and in international markets. In the first quarter, we achieved 30% of our full-year store opening target. ", "Number two, total net revenue growth of 22% and comparable store sales growth of 6% validates our ambitious targets. ", "Number three, we continued to make strategic investments in our business while delivering 18% earnings per share growth over strong growth in the first quarter of last year. ", "And four, for the consolidated business we controlled general and administrative expenses at a record low percent of revenue. ", "On the other side of the ledger, we have two specific opportunities to improve our performance, which I would like to share with you. ", "As our U.S. retail business evolves and our product offerings expand, we are experiencing a shift to a greater mix of food in our stores. This places some pressure on gross margins when compared to our highest margin products, beverages. Yet, the impact to the U.S. operating margin is mitigated by lower operating expenses associated with food than beverages. ", "Historically, we have seen our food programs improve in the second year of operations and beyond as we better understand our customers\u2019 needs and are able to adapt our product mix and offerings. The Warming program is no exception. ", "We have mentioned numerous times that our International business is subject to unevenness in margin performance among periods, which is driven by investment opportunities that may arise during any given quarter. We continue to see strong customer demand internationally and we are investing to ensure we can meet that demand and appropriately support both new and expanding markets. Over time, we expect to get leverage from these investments. ", "Finally, as you probably know, dairy prices took a dramatic rise as we entered the second fiscal quarter, and based on what we are seeing today, we believe they will continue to be volatile and unfavorable through the remainder of our fiscal year. We have taken this impact into account in our full-year targets. ", "Looking ahead to the balance of fiscal 2007, we continue to be very confident in our ability to achieve our aggressive growth targets for the year. We are on track to hit our store opening targets for the year, entering the last three-quarters of fiscal 2007 at an accelerated pace. ", "Average unit volumes in our retail stores continue to be strong. Investment in our future growth engine, the International business, will be ongoing since we are still in the early stages of growth for that business. ", "As Howard noted earlier, our increase in equity ownership in Beijing is just one example of how we are opportunistically building out that market as part of our long-term growth strategy in International markets. ", "And for our consolidated business, we expect favorable store operating expense comparisons starting in the second quarter, and we expect modest improvements in operating margin in the second half of the fiscal year. ", "Turning now to our fiscal 2007 targets: we continue to target opening approximately 2,400 new stores on a global basis. In the United States, we plan to open approximately 1,000 Company-operated locations and 700 licensed locations. In International markets, we plan to open approximately 300 Company-operated stores and 400 licensed stores. ", "We continue to expect total net revenue growth of approximately 20% and comparable store sales growth in the 3% to 7% range. ", "We now expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 37% for the full fiscal year, with quarterly variations. This is a decrease from our previously stated full-year estimate of 38%, due in part to increased effectiveness of the Company\u2019s long-term tax planning strategies. ", "And we continue to target earnings per share in the range of $0.87 to $0.89, based on first quarter results and our current outlook for the balance of the year which, among other things, factors in the impact of rising dairy costs and the favorable impact of a lower effective tax rate. ", "As stated earlier on the call, our first half performance in fiscal 2006 was particularly strong, making for a more challenging comparison. ", "With that, I would like to ask the Operator to queue the first question. Please ask one question at a time and re-queue for additional questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) ", "Your first question comes from Larry Miller. ", "Larry Miller - Prudential Equity Group", "I just have a question about the cost of sales, Michael, if you could help me understand that better. It sounds like, if I\u2019m hearing you correctly, that there are some inefficiencies as you are rolling out lunch, and that might be a bigger impact than say the mix shift from adding food. Could you help me dimensionalize what might actually be going on behind that line and what we could expect going forward, when you might lap the bulk of the lunch rollout? Thank you. ", "Michael Casey", "I think you\u2019ve hit on a good point, in that in the beginning of our food program, and I think this was true of lunch here several years ago and warming today, we\u2019re not as efficient as we are once we\u2019ve lapped ourselves in various markets. But as far as cost of goods sold is concerned, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a major influence. ", "The major factor in the cost of goods sold is in the occupancy line and in the overall mix toward the food business, not particularly the lunch or warming is excessively inefficient. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s more food in the mix than there was before, and the food products have a lower gross margin than the hand-crafted beverages. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glen Petraglia with Citigroup. ", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Good afternoon. Could you maybe comment on the increased wage rates that you\u2019ve put in place? Should that in any way imply that you\u2019re having a harder time finding qualified employees in this low unemployment environment? Thanks. ", "James L. Donald", "Not at all. We continually look at our wage rates throughout the world, I would say, and we are constantly using this to benchmark against other companies in the industry. We want to become, we want to remain ahead of what we consider to be our competition and actually look at paying a rate that retains and attracts. ", "We didn\u2019t see any of this happening to create this. We did this because of what we were hearing from some of our partners. What we do is when our partners are bringing up issues, we listen to what they say, we put down the effort and the time to get to the root of the problem, and we saw some opportunities. ", "We in no way though did this as a reaction to what was happening in the market, but rather to be proactive in getting this out and, again, addressing the concerns of our partners. ", "But our turnover and our attrition has remained constant for the most part for the last four to five years. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Glass with CIBC. ", "John Glass - CIBC", "Thanks. I wanted to ask about the wage increase as well. Could you compare the relative size of the manager wage increase, which I think you talked about in this quarter, the second quarter, versus the increase you did last quarter? Does the lack of the leadership conference, does that cover it for a quarter or does that cover the wage increase for the balance of this year? How long is that benefit, that offset take place? Thanks. ", "James L. Donald", "The wage increase for the managers is significantly less than the wage increase for the hourly, because there\u2019s just so many more hourly employees than there are managers. ", "With regard to the leadership conference, that helps offset the impact of the wage increase in the second quarter, but only in the second quarter. Going forward, we expect the benefit to, we expect the offset to come from the price increase, as it did in the first quarter, and as we continue to be more efficient with our labor force going forward. ", "Howard Schultz", "I want to add one thing. This historically, for those of you who have followed the company for many years, I think there has been a direct correlation and relationship to our ability to build long-term value for our shareholders while building long-term value for our people. ", "I think one of the reasons why we\u2019ve continued to do as well as we have is because the people who represent the company to our customers every day have a high degree of trust and confidence in the intent of Starbucks to do the right thing. ", "As Jim said, it wasn\u2019t the pressure of our inability to attract the right person. It\u2019s being proactive and recognizing we\u2019re asking our people to do more, the marketplace is getting more competitive in the future and we want to stay ahead of the curve. We also want to demonstrate to our people that we are in the business of taking care of them as well as our shareholders. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Lehman Brothers. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. Just a question on the overall G&A expenses. Obviously you experienced tremendous savings on that line on an absolute dollar basis as well as a percentage basis, looking like it\u2019s down below 5%. I know you mentioned benefiting from charitable contributions last year, incentive compensation last year. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about your outlook for that line item going forward. Would you expect similar significant savings in coming quarters, or would this quarter be more of an anomaly and not sustainable going forward? Thanks. ", "James L. Donald", "The year-over-year absolute dollar decline was due primarily to the exceptional items that weren\u2019t in that line item last year. But as a percentage of sales, we can expect it to be well-controlled and favorable through the remainder of the year as a percentage of sales. ", " Remembering that the first quarter is always the lowest percentage. The subsequent quarters are a little bit higher, but on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re expecting leverage in the G&A line throughout the year. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "As we have seen over the last year. ", "James L. Donald", "Yes, as we have generally seen over the last several years. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Howard Penney with Prudential Equity Group. ", "Howard Penney - Prudential Equity Group", "Thanks very much. Howard, years ago you basically successfully killed the hopes of any potential competitor from becoming a national coffee company, and really it\u2019s unlikely that there will ever be another company that\u2019s as successful as Starbucks, has the brand awareness, financial resources that Starbucks has. Having witnessed other companies that run into troubles with continued aggressive growth targets, I would like to hear your response on two things: one, how do you prevent the natural pitfalls of aggressive growth targets leading to larger organizations, and again, knowing that you\u2019ve sort of -- there isn\u2019t really anybody out there doing what you\u2019re doing today on the scale that you\u2019re doing, why do you continue to push the limits of growth and maybe focus a little bit more on profitability and reallocating some dollars towards those markets where there really is some huge potential, China, Russia and what not? Thanks very much. ", "Howard Schultz", "That\u2019s a lot of question, Howard. Let me try and answer that this way. First off, I think that we have been public since 1992, and I think no matter what year you examine the company, we have been an aggressive growth company going after unique opportunities. I think very few people early on believed that we could have 1,000 stores, let along 13,000 today and going to 40,000. ", "But clearly the size of the prize is much bigger than we ever imagined. The reception that we have garnered around the world in country after country is more enthusiastic than we had originally planned. ", "So we\u2019re sitting with one of the world\u2019s most recognized and respected brands, with a concept that is as relevant around the world as it is in Seattle or your hometown, and a demand for the product from customers that we believe it is our responsibility to take advantage of. ", "I think candidly, one of the challenges that we have had over the years, which continues, which we\u2019ve talked about both internally and externally is how do you get big and stay small? How do you maintain trust with your people, trust with the customer, and how do you provide a company in which the brand is not defined by size or scale but by one customer, one cup of coffee and one partner at a time? I think we\u2019ve done that. ", "Specifically to your question about -- this is not an either/or situation. I think we have managed to create a balance between significant growth and development, and at the same time, demonstrating profitability in multiple channels of distribution as well as now our international business. ", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019re trading off one for the other. In fact, I think we\u2019re doing things that demonstrate that we can do both and we\u2019ve done both for over a decade now. But I think the short answer is the opportunity is larger than we originally thought. The acceptance we\u2019ve gotten around the world is significant, and we\u2019re continuing to take advantage of it and we think that\u2019s our responsibility, both to our shareholders and our people. ", "If there ever was a situation where we felt the growth was doing to dilute the integrity of the brand or prevent us from creating long-term value for our shareholders, we would slow it down or stop it. That has not been the case, so we\u2019re in a unique position, domestically and around the world, and these are still the early days for the growth and development of Starbucks and we want to take advantage of it and we\u2019re well-positioned to do it because we\u2019ve made the investments over the years ahead of the growth curve. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. ", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair", "Good afternoon. I wanted to touch a little bit on the labor deployment. I\u2019m curious, as you try to become more efficient with labor in the stores, how you balance the risk of slowing down customer through-put and how you monitor that? ", "James L. Donald", "Sharon, that\u2019s exactly what that is, is the balance. When we look at labor deployment we, through out scheduling means as well as our own intuition, schedule for the business hours that are at their peak. In addition to that, we make sure that at those peak times, that the deployment occurs where the bottleneck is. So it\u2019s not something that you just rubber-stamp out. It\u2019s different by week, it\u2019s different by month, it\u2019s different by quarter, it\u2019s different by store. So every store manager has the say and the authority to bring in or to possibly reduce at a certain hour or bring them back in in the evenings. ", "It\u2019s done on a store-by-store, market-by-market basis. ", "Howard Schultz", "Sharon, congratulations on becoming a partner of the firm. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Thomas Weisel Partners. ", "Matt DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Hi. Either Howard or Jim, if you could just answer this question, regarding as you\u2019re getting larger and exposing yourself or trying to garner a greater demographic, how do you view now the price value equation and your ability to take price on, not only the beverage products but also things that might not be direct core items, such as food? Is there an opportunity there? If you need that, do you think that\u2019s a lever that could be used greater in \u201907 if there were a national minimum wage increase or greater labor pressure? ", "James L. Donald", "Regardless of our size, we\u2019re mindful of what we want to do on taking price. We\u2019ve only taken two price increases since I\u2019ve been here in 2002, and in both cases, one was commodity driven back in 2004, and while we did see some slight commodity increases in \u201906, we were also helping what the first question was about, take advantage of the ability to help offset some of the increases for our partners. ", "But we don\u2019t take price increases with a grain of salt and we want to make sure that when we do this, there is a reason to justify the means. ", "Howard Schultz", "I would just add that I think if you look at the landscape of consumer brands at retailers and restaurants, I think we\u2019d all be hard-pressed to find many companies that have been able to take price and maintain the customer relationship and profile. So the pricing power of Starbucks has remained because the loyalty and trust that people have in the experience of the brand, we take the responsibility of price increases very carefully and judicially. ", "We think there are other ways in which we can gain leverage in the future, and want to use price as a last resort. Having said that, we recognize that there are sometimes fewer opportunities, and in this case we took one this year basically to pay for the wages. ", "Michael Casey", "I would just add, there seems to be sort of an implication about profitability. I would just add that double-digit pre-tax profit, approximately 25% return on equity and a top-line growth in excess of 20% is a better formula than passing up some of the opportunities that are being presented to us on a daily basis in order to increase that pre-tax margin by a percentage point or so in the short-term. ", "Operator", "We have time for one more question. Your last question comes from Ashley Woodruff with FBR. ", "Ashley Woodruff - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group", "Thanks. I have a question on the higher occupancy expense. Is that simply a function of pre-opening holiday rent that you have to expense, and so that should kind of taper off as you open more stores? Or is that a function of opening stores at a more accelerated rate and having to pay more for sites, or not being able to negotiate the same rent deals as in the past? ", "James L. Donald", "It\u2019s not the latter, it\u2019s the former. There have been a couple of changes in the situation versus let\u2019s say a couple of years ago. One, we have accelerated our opening schedule, so we have more stores at any given time that are in the construction process. For example, at the current year, we have over 700 stores at one point in time or another in construction, or in the process of construction during the first quarter. ", "Including as an example the fact that we acquired about 60 stores from Barney\u2019s in Florida earlier in the year and we were carrying those stores during the process of construction as they were being converted to Starbucks stores. ", "So there\u2019s more regular stores, there\u2019s the Barney\u2019s acquisition, and then there\u2019s the change in accounting that took place about a year or so ago where historically, if you had a 10-year lease and 10 years worth of rent, you\u2019d expense it over the 10 years. Now, we\u2019re required to expense rent from the date of possession, so when we take possession of a property, it may be two months before it opens, we\u2019re now expensing the rent during that period in time when historically, we weren\u2019t. So that makes a difference too, and it\u2019s exacerbated by the fact that we\u2019ve accelerated development and we\u2019ve done some strategic, multi-unit acquisitions for conversion. ", "Thank you all very much. We look forward to seeing you, talking to you next quarter. ", "JoAnn DeGrande", "We\u2019ll talk to you again on our fiscal second quarter 2007 webcast on May 2, 2007.

Good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks\u2019 second quarter financial performance demonstrates our success in achieving a balance between driving solid top and bottom line growth while expanding globally and enhancing our brand with new offerings, which we feel are complementary to our core business and accretive to our bottom line. ", "We are very pleased with our financial results for the second quarter, especially in light of the fact that we were up against last year\u2019s exceptionally strong second quarter. ", "Today, we reported: net revenues of $2.3 billion dollars, up 20% from the same period in fiscal 2006; net earnings were $151 million dollars, up 18% from the second quarter of fiscal 2006; Earnings per share were $0.19, up 19% from the same period of fiscal 2006; new store openings continued at a strong pace, as we opened 560 stores during the second quarter, bringing our total to 13,728 locations in 39 countries. We continue to see significant opportunity in store development both domestically and internationally. ", "We delivered comparable store sales growth of 4% for the quarter, 1% transaction and 3% ticket. Our two year comparable store sales growth was 14% for the second quarter. ", "Our focus remains on growing our business by providing our customers the traditional coffeehouse offerings they\u2019ve come to expect, from Starbucks handcrafted espresso beverages to seasonal and promotional offerings. ", "We\u2019ve also built and continue to grow a platform of food and merchandise that complements our coffee and enhances our customers\u2019 overall experience. Premium coffees, handcrafted espresso beverages, prepared lunches, warm breakfast sandwiches and carefully selected entertainment options delivered with exceptional service all create that special Starbucks Experience for our customers. ", "Starbucks has the unique ability to leverage its business by building a total customer experience both inside and outside of our stores. We have done this with products like Bottled Frappuccino beverages here in the U.S. and Discoveries, our ready-to-drink product in Japan and Taiwan, as well as with music, film and most recently, literature. ", "We will continue to explore ways to enhance our customers\u2019 experiences and create long-term shareholder value, all while remaining mindful of our core -- premium coffee. ", "April 1st marked the midpoint of our fiscal year and our solid first half results position us well to reach our ambitious fiscal year 2007 growth targets. ", "Let\u2019s take a look at what contributed to our financial results, beginning with the U.S. business. ", "In the U.S., we\u2019re continuing our track record of opening stores where our customers want us to be and offering products that match consumer needs. U.S. Company-operated retail revenue growth of 18% for the quarter was led by the addition of 1,042 new Company-operated stores in the last twelve months and comparable store sales growth driven by sales of both our seasonal and core handcrafted beverages, and by our expanded food offerings. ", "The 3% comparable store sales growth recorded for the quarter was driven by ticket and represents very solid growth when you consider it comes on top of last year\u2019s incredibly strong second-quarter comparable store sales growth of 10%. ", "Let me give you a brief recap of what was happening in our stores during the quarter. The introduction of the Cinnamon Dolce Latte last year was one of the most successful new promotional beverage offerings in Starbucks history. So this year, we built upon the popularity of the Cinnamon Dolce Latte by introducing a version made with sugar free syrup, which was met with strong customer acceptance. ", "In addition, food provided a greater contribution to overall sales. We rolled out our lunch program to 250 more Starbucks locations this past quarter, providing added convenience to our customers, which translated into strong revenue contribution and an increase in average check. We now offer lunch at more than 4,400 Starbucks stores in the U.S., about 70% of our U.S. Company-operated locations. ", "Moving on to our warmed breakfast offerings, during the second quarter we brought warming to approximately 500 more stores, giving us a quarter-end total of more than 1,700 stores. We entered three new markets -- Los Angeles with 136 stores, Boston with 94 stores and Fresno with 59 stores. ", "Similar to our lunch program, we are pleased with the customer acceptance and with the revenue generation that warming provides. We remain enthusiastic about this program and plan to continue an aggressive rollout to more stores in the U.S. in the future. As a result, we expect to have warming in nearly half of our U.S. Company-operated stores by the end of fiscal 2007. ", "Now let me give you a brief snapshot of our spring promotional campaign that features beverages, food, unique merchandise and in-store marketing to build a complete customer experience focused on Latin America. ", "As you may know, Latin America is a very important region of origin for Starbucks and one that has a rich coffee culture. This promotion celebrates that coffee culture with the flavors of Latin America in our beverages, select bakery offerings, CDs and unique merchandise created by exceptional artists from Costa Rica. Early indications are that this holistic approach to the promotion is resonating with our customers and is adding fun and excitement in the stores for our partners. ", "As we look ahead, expansion in the U.S. continues to drive the need for increased roasting plant capacity. By the end of the year, we expect to break ground on a new roasting plant in South Carolina. This would be Starbucks\u2019 fourth roasting plant in the U.S. and fifth plant worldwide. The South Carolina roasting plant will support the southeastern part of the U.S. and is scheduled to begin operation in early 2009. ", "Before I move on to International, I\u2019d like to recap some highlights from our Music and Entertainment business during the quarter. As we have said in the past, Starbucks has a unique place in the daily lives of our customers. Our stores serve as a gathering place where people come to share a sense of community and connection over a cup of coffee. This makes our stores an ideal channel to present our customers with music, movies and literature that are complementary to their lives and to the Starbucks Experience. ", " This quarter, our Music and Entertainment business recognized many successes, from the sales of A Long Way Gone, which landed on the New York Times Bestseller list and ultimately hit number one, to the sale of the DVDs Happy Feet and Will Smith\u2019s Pursuit of Happyness to selling 10% of Nora Jones\u2019 national new CD release, Not Too Late, which has sold, by the way, more than 1 million copies. ", "We believe that the Starbucks environment lends itself well to presenting our customers with these relevant forms of entertainment, and the success of this platform speaks for itself. ", "I\u2019d like to turn to the International business, starting with some observations from my trip to China last week. During my trip, I attended the Boao Forum for Asia. This annual conference provides an opportunity for more than 1,300 official delegates from government leaders to top corporate executives to industry experts to discuss the economic growth and the development of Asia. ", "I\u2019m happy to say that today, I am even more excited about our opportunities in China than I was in the past. I also participated in the opening celebrations for our first regional support center in Guangzhou and the opening of our 500th store in the Greater China Region. ", "The most striking observation to me was how well our stores in China are executing on the Starbucks experience. Our partners are doing a wonderful job delivering high quality beverages and providing legendary service. I was also impressed by the level of commitment our partners had to their local communities, really helping to make Starbucks not only a destination in the communities but an integral part of those communities. ", "Because of these factors, Starbucks is continuing to see strong acceptance from our customers in China. In fact, when I was behind the counter at one of our stores, I heard a familiar accent. I looked up, I introduced myself to the customer and she was from Long Island. She asked to take a picture with me back to Long Island to put it in her Starbucks store. Now to me, this is proof that Starbucks truly is the third place for our customers, somewhere that\u2019s comfortable for them when they are far away from home. ", "Turning to the second quarter results, it was another strong sales period for our International business. International Company-operated retail revenues were $327 million dollars, up 32% from the same period in fiscal 2006. ", "Continued rapid expansion of our global footprint and strong comparable store sales growth combined to deliver outstanding revenue growth in the International segment. We introduced the Starbucks experience to thousands of new customers. We opened 147 new stores during the quarter, bringing our store count outside the U.S. to nearly 4,000 locations in 38 countries. And we delivered comparable store sales growth of 7% -- 5% transaction, 2% ticket. ", "Our second-quarter results also demonstrated that we are still very much in a growth phase with this business, which requires substantial investment to build the foundation for the future. ", "If we take a look at the two largest markets contributing to our International retail revenues, the U.K. and Canada, the key drivers behind sales for the quarter were a combination of hand-crafted espresso and tea beverages, as well as food items. ", "Looking forward, we recently opened our first store in Bucharest, Romania, marking our entry into Central Europe. We also recently announced that through our relationship with HMS Host, we plan to open Starbucks locations in the airports in both Copenhagen and Amsterdam, our first entries into Scandinavia and The Netherlands respectively. ", "We are excited about the opportunities in all of these new markets and this is just another affirmation of the tremendous global prospect for Starbucks. ", "As we have said numerous times, our International business represents the future growth engine of the Company and we will continue to invest ahead of the curve to build the infrastructure and foundation for our growth, on the way to our ultimate store target of at least 20,000 stores outside the U.S. ", "I want to shift from International to our Global Consumer Products business, and remind everybody that that spans both the U.S. and International. ", "For the second quarter, Global CPG reported net revenues of $79 million dollars, due in part to sales of Discoveries, the line up of ready-to-drink beverages in Japan, which continue to climb, nearly tripling in unit volume year-over-year. The growth was fueled by expanded distribution to additional cities, including Osaka and Nagoya. During the quarter, we launched a third Discoveries flavor in Tokyo -- Qandi, which is a caramel flavor. ", "Looking ahead, the expansion of our packaged coffee distribution through our partnership with Kraft into Canada and the U.K. has taken off at a fast clip and we see additional expansion opportunities ahead. The availability of Starbucks packaged coffee in grocery stores will allow coffee-lovers in these markets to enjoy the authentic great taste of Starbucks coffee in the comfort of their own homes. ", "I\u2019d like to discuss some accolades that Starbucks has recently received. In combination with our solid financial performance and the strength of our commitment to our guiding principles, several prestigious organizations, including Business Ethics, Fortune Magazine, DiversityInc, Financial Times and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, recognized Starbucks during the quarter. ", "Our awards ranged from Business Ethic\u2019s \u201c100 Best Corporate Citizens\u201d to Fortune Magazine\u2019s \u201c2nd Most Admired Companies in America\u201d to ranking 6th in the \u201cTop 25 Green Power Partners,\u201d by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Coming off our recognition last quarter as one of Fortune\u2019s \u201cBest Companies to Work For,\u201d this quarter Starbucks was recognized in the U.K. and Mexico as one of the \u201cFive Best Places to Work\u201d, coming in at number two in Mexico after only five years in operation. ", "Additionally, we recently climbed a remarkable 13 spots and were ranked as one of the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Valuable Brands\u201d by Millward Brown, one of the world\u2019s leading research companies that evaluates companies based on their marketing, their media and their brand performance. This type of recognition would not be possible without the support of all of our dedicated partners. ", "Before I close and turn the call over to Michael, I wanted to mention the upcoming arrival of our CFO designate, Pete Bocian. Pete will be joining Starbucks in the next few weeks and will work closely with Michael through the end of the fiscal year. We are very excited to have Pete on board and we look forward to introducing him to the financial community in the near future. ", "So in summary, we are pleased with our second quarter results and we are also pleased to have two of the most difficult quarterly comparisons in the Company\u2019s history behind us. We believe that in addition to our ultimate goal of 40,000 stores worldwide, we can extend the brand to best-of-class products and present Starbucks in terms of new channels of distribution that no other retailer has done before. ", "We also know that although we are a coffee company, we also have the license to do things beyond coffee because of the trust around the experience and the Starbucks brand. Our long-term strategy, level of execution and passion are all elements that make this company sustainable. ", "I believe that these things will help our brand endure the test of time. Starbucks will be recognized not only for creating shareholder value, but also for creating a company that our customers, our partners and our shareholders will continue to be proud of. ", "As we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we will continue to focus on our core business and driving solid execution at all levels, and believe we are well positioned to reach our ambitious fiscal year 2007 growth targets. ", "With that, Michael will now review our financial results for the quarter. Michael. ", "Michael Casey", "Thank you, Jim. Today I will begin by providing additional detail on some of the significant factors impacting our financial performance, followed by an outlook for the second half of the fiscal year. ", "As reported, consolidated top line growth was 20%, with 4% comparable store sales growth for the second quarter, both consistent with our targets. ", "Consolidated operating income increased 19% to $241 million for the 13 weeks ended April 1, 2007 from $202 million in the prior year. As a percentage of total net revenues, operating margin at 10.7% was equal to last year\u2019s second-quarter margin, halting three consecutive quarters of year-over-year declining operating margins. ", "Higher cost of sales, including occupancy, were offset by both lower store operating expenses and lower general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues. ", "The increase in consolidated cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues was driven primarily by rising costs in the U.S. business. I will cover the main drivers behind these rising costs in my U.S. business segment remarks. ", "Consolidated store operating expenses and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased, primarily due to higher provisions in the prior year for incentive compensation based on exceptionally strong performance. ", "Consolidated earnings per share were a strong $0.19 in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to $0.16 for the comparable period in fiscal 2006, an increase of 19%. I mentioned the strong $0.19 earnings per share because it caused the year-to-date earnings to round to $0.46, which is a penny more than the sum of the first and second quarters\u2019 EPS results. ", "Now let me move to second-quarter results from our operating segments. ", "Beginning with the U.S. operating segment, total net revenues, which account for approximately 79% of consolidated total net revenues, increased by 19% to $1.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. ", "Company-operated retail revenues rose 18% to $1.6 billion for the quarter, driven by the opening of 1,042 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, and comparable store sales growth of 3% for the quarter. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 3% increase in average value per transaction. ", "U.S. specialty revenues grew by 23% to $194 million in the second quarter. Within specialty revenues, licensing revenues increased 29% to $105 million, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 768 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. ", "Foodservice and other revenues increased 17% to $89 million mainly due to the addition of new accounts and the growth in existing foodservice accounts. ", "U.S. cost of sales, including occupancy costs, as a percentage of total revenues increased to 39.6% compared to 37.7% in the comparable period a year ago. This was primarily due to the following: first, a shift in sales to food and merchandise, which are higher cost products than beverages; second, higher rent expense due to an increase in both average square footage per store and cost per square foot, driven primarily by growth in higher priced real estate markets; and third, increased distribution costs related to our growing store base and the expansion of our food programs. ", "U.S. store operating expenses improved to 41.0% of related Company-operated retail revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 from 42% in the prior year, primarily due to higher provisions a year ago for incentive compensation based on exceptionally strong performance in fiscal 2006. However, there continued to be higher payroll expenditures in 2007 as a result of the Company\u2019s October wage increase for hourly store partners and, to a lesser degree, the second-quarter wage increase for our store management partners. ", "U.S. operating income increased to $268 million during the quarter, from $231 million during the same period in fiscal 2006. Due to the cost pressures I just mentioned in cost of sales and occupancy, operating margin decreased to 15.0% of related revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 from 15.3% a year ago. ", "Now moving to the International segment. International total revenues, which account for approximately 17% of consolidated net revenues, increased 30% to $387 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. International Company-operated retail revenues increased 32% to $327 million in the second quarter of 2007, mainly due to the opening of 237 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, comparable store sales growth of 7% for the quarter, and favorable foreign currency exchange for the British pound sterling. ", "The comparable store sales increase resulted from a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions, coupled with a 2% increase in the average value per transaction, demonstrating the health and strength of our International retail business, which bodes well for the future. ", "International specialty revenues for the quarter increased 21% to $60 million, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 456 licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. ", "Operating income for International operations was $21 million in the second quarter of this year compared to $19 million in fiscal 2006. The operating margin decreased to 5.5% of related revenues from 6.5% in fiscal 2006. This decrease was primarily due to higher other operating expenses and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. Growth in both of these categories was driven by increased payroll-related expenditures to support continued growth and systems infrastructure development. We continue to invest in people and systems to position the business to capture the significant global opportunity in front of us. ", "In the second quarter, this included increased investments in emerging markets such as China, as well as for more established, yet still growing markets such as the U.K. and Europe, and increased spending for global store development capabilities in support of rapid international store growth. ", "As we have said previously, our ongoing investments in international infrastructure can be expected to cause variability in quarterly operating margins. ", "Now let me move on to our third business segment, the Consumer Products Group. CPG total net revenues, which account for approximately 4% of consolidated total net revenues, increased to $79 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. This was due mainly to increased product sales and royalties in our International ready-to-drink business, partially offset by decreased shipment volumes in the U.S. to Kraft, our distribution partner for packaged coffee and tea. ", "Note that sales of packaged coffee and tea from Kraft to grocery retailers actually grew during the quarter over the prior year, but lower inventory levels throughout the U.S. distribution system resulted in lower shipment volumes. These movements in inventory levels throughout the system are normal and can cause variability in quarterly CPG revenues. ", "Operating income for CPG of $38 million for the second quarter was unchanged from the same period a year ago. The operating margin decreased to 47.8% of related revenues from 48.6% in fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher other operating expenses. ", "The increase in other operating expenses was due to higher marketing expenditures to support continued expansion of ready-to-drink beverages in the Asia-Pacific region. Partially offsetting the increases in other operating expenses was higher income from equity investees, attributable to our ready-to-drink beverage business in the U.S. ", "Over the years, we have achieved strong growth and profitability from our CPG products in the U.S. and we are enthusiastic about the strong early results as we introduce these products into markets outside of the country. ", "Turning now to a brief review of our year-to-date results, our consolidated operating income increased 16% to $561 million in the first half of this year from $482 million in the first half of last year. Operating margin was 12.2% compared to 12.6% in the first half of last year, which was the highest operating margin ever reported by the Company for the first six months of a fiscal year. Net earnings rose 18% during the first half of the fiscal year, earnings per share increased 21% and we opened 1,288 net new stores. ", "We are pleased with our financial performance in the first half of the year, given the tough comparisons from the prior year. This positions us well as we enter the second half of the fiscal year when we expect modest year-over-year operating margin improvement primarily in the fourth quarter, despite the recent increase in dairy prices. ", "Now for a few comments on the Starbucks balance sheet. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, Starbucks repurchased 14.3 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $465 million under authorized share repurchase programs. Along with the 3.6 million shares repurchased in the first quarter, the total spent on share repurchase through the first half of this fiscal year was $594 million. ", "Even more noteworthy, since the inception of Starbucks\u2019 initial authorized share repurchase plan in 2001, the Company has returned over $3 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 120 million shares. ", "And on May 1, with 1.1 million shares available for repurchase under the previous authorization, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 25 million additional shares. ", "In late March 2007, Starbucks established a commercial paper program, which allows the Company to issue unsecured commercial paper notes, up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1 billion. This program is a cost effective alternative to the Company's borrowings under its revolving credit facility, and does not change the overall borrowing capacity. ", "At the end of the fiscal second quarter, the outstanding balance on the Company\u2019s credit revolver was $847 million and there were no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program. Following quarter end, borrowings have begun through the program, which are effectively re-financing earlier borrowings under the credit facility. ", "Starbucks\u2019 solid balance sheet, continuing strong cash flows, and borrowing capacity allow us to continue to fund our operations, selectively invest in new growth opportunities and opportunistically repurchase shares. ", "Let me now recap for you the key highlights of our fiscal second quarter: we achieved very strong results in the quarter, especially considering the extremely difficult prior year comparisons. ", "Operating margin was equal to last year\u2019s record Q2 margin, halting operating margin declines the previous 3 quarters. Building on the strengthening operating margin in Q2, we expect modest improvement in operating margin over the balance of the year, despite the more challenging cost environment we face, particularly in the areas of labor costs and dairy. ", "We continue to experience very strong growth internationally, both in retail stores and in CPG, boding well for the future growth and profitability and underscoring the huge opportunity Starbucks has around the world ", "We continue to successfully execute our aggressive growth plans in the U.S. and overseas, adding 560 stores in the quarter and 1,288 for the first 6 months of this fiscal year, and 2,503 in the last 12 months. ", "In summary, we are achieving our growth and earnings targets, trending toward improving operating margins, and rapidly expanding the Starbucks brand in the U.S. and around the world. ", "Turning now to our fiscal 2007 targets, we continue to target opening approximately 2,400 new stores on a global basis. In the United States, we plan to open approximately 1,000 Company-operated locations and 700 licensed locations. In International markets, we plan to open approximately 300 Company-operated stores and 400 licensed stores. ", "We continue to expect total net revenue growth of approximately 20% and comparable store sales growth in the 3 to 7% range. ", "We continue to target earnings per share in the range of $0.87 to $0.89, based on results from the first half of our fiscal year and our current outlook for the balance of the year which, among other things, factors in the impact of rising dairy costs. ", "With that, I would like to ask the Operator to queue the first question. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) ", "Your first question comes from John Glass with CIBC. ", "John Glass - CIBC", "Thanks. Your traffic in the U.S. was flat I think probably for the first time ever, or at least in a long time. I am wondering if you could address that. I understand tough comparisons but we have seen those before in the company\u2019s history. ", "I guess specifically, you\u2019ve got this warming and breakfast program now which I would think would maybe offset some of those tough comparisons, drive more customers into the store. Can you talk about is that then your experience, or is that more of a substitution purchase? ", "Maybe also could you talk about what else happens when they purchase a sandwich -- do they buy a smaller drink or the same size drink? Is it changing the dynamic of other purchases as well? Thanks. ", "James L. Donald", "John, we are seeing some incremental pick-up with the purchase of a warming sandwich, but by and large, we have seen a headwind in previous years, but as Michael stated, the headwind last year on 10% comps and the transaction growth that we experienced with that was a primary driver. It is not a weather issue. We had pockets of the stores throughout the U.S. that actually were shut down, but the primary driver of that was the headwind of the strong tropical sales growth last year. ", "John Glass - CIBC", "And just your view on if breakfast sandwiches do actually add traffic to the store versus just the ticker? ", "James L. Donald", "Traffic, traffic to ticket, and we are seeing incremental beverage too, but we are seeing and one of the reasons that we continue to be very bullish on our warming sandwich is that, I think Michael and I can give you an example. In New York just last year, we are seeing customers that before we put warming in were coming to our store with a warming sandwich from another venue, and so we are seeing us capturing that customer all in one fell swoop, so we are seeing that continue to generate transaction. ", "John Glass - CIBC", "Thank you. ", "Michael Casey", "John, just for a data point, we had 8% transaction growth in our U.S. retail stores in the second quarter of last year. ", "John Glass - CIBC", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashley Woodruff with FBR. ", "Ashley Woodruff - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group", "Thanks. Actually, a follow-up on that question. You said the reason for the flat traffic is really the more difficult comparison. I guess as you look out over the rest of the year, comparisons do get easier. Are you optimistic that you can start to positive traffic growth again, or is this a trend that we should look for more growth coming from check rather than traffic? ", "James L. Donald", "The overall comparable guideline, we are very comfortable with the 3% to 7%, and there is nothing more to say other than that we think we will be in that 3% to 7% growth range. Michael, did you have anything to add to that? ", "Michael Casey", "I\u2019ll just add that of the 3% average ticket increase that we have had, about 1.5% of that is from the price increase that we took, but the other 1.5% is from the attachment of things like music, food, et cetera, so it is contributing to the same-store sales and the growth of the business. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley with Bear Stearns. ", "Joseph Buckley - Bear Stearns", "A follow-up on that again; just on the breakfast sandwiches, and I realize it is not driving your whole system, but the markets where you have it, is your traffic up in that morning day part, or is this an add-on sale that to your point, Jim, customers are buying their food at Starbucks as opposed to somewhere else? ", "James L. Donald", "No, Joe, the traffic is up in those markets. We are seeing an increase in transaction count. ", "Joseph Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Okay, and just one more question on G&A. Obviously pretty well controlled, very well controlled again in the quarter. Tell us how we should think about it going forward. Is it plateau-ing here? Because in prior year investments, and -- is it likely to stay very well-controlled or is it plateau-ing here and likely to start ramping up again sometime soon as you grow? ", "Michael Casey", "I think you should reasonably expect that the G&A is going to continue to grow with the business, but it is going to grow at a slower rate, such that as a percentage of revenue, it will continue to decline, as it has over the last four or five years. ", "I also think you can expect to see a shift in the G&A from -- in previous years, we\u2019ve built G&A in the U.S. business unit and in our corporate headquarters. More recently, the growth has been in our international business as we develop those markets and it has been very tightly contained, as you can tell from the segment reporting in our U.S. business and in our headquarters operations. ", "Joseph Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Lehman Brothers. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. Just a follow-up, actually, on Michael\u2019s comments earlier about the strong balance sheet. We have been hearing from a more mature restaurants concepts taking on leverage to generate value, especially if stock is sitting at more depressed valuations. Obviously Starbucks is still clearly in the growth stages and investing heavily across the globe, but I am just wondering if there is an opportunity to take on some leverage, perhaps a more aggressive share repurchase? Obviously it was aggressive this past quarter, but that or other means of returning capital. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about the uses of cash and the opportunity for more aggressive use of the balance sheet. Thanks. ", "Michael Casey", "Our priorities are very clear, that our first priorities are to satisfy the operational requirements of our business, the maintenance of our existing storage, the growth of new storage, purchase of equity in our international licensees when those opportunities present themselves. ", "And after that, we have -- and support operations like IT infrastructure and the new roasting plant that we will be building here in the next year or so. And then after that, we consider the possibility of share repurchase and we have done that quite aggressively over the last few years. ", "We have a fairly extensive capital structure and financial framework review and concluded we are way too early in our growth cycle to consider any different kind of use of the balance sheet. ", "We have no intentions to leverage up the balance sheet for more aggressive share repurchase. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kron with Goldman Sachs. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Great, thanks very much. A couple of questions, actually; first, on the margin line, it seems like on the store operating expense and on the G&A line year over year, you\u2019ve had some benefit from just lapping higher incentive compensation. Just a question for you, Michael. As we get to the back half here and we are expecting margin expansion again and the comps are going to be a little bit easier on a year-over-year basis, might we expect that incentive compensation on a year-over-year basis will start to pick back up? ", "Michael Casey", "I don\u2019t think so. Not to the level that it was last year. We continue to accrue incentive compensation through the first half of this year, just not at the elevated levels that were associated with the outstanding performance last year. But we expect to have a normal incentive compensation accrual through the remainder of this year. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then if I can just ask a question on the international business, given certainly the increased international store growth and the impressive comps that you guys have been able to post there, I was wondering if you could just provide us a little bit more granularity on maybe regional strength -- what markets are really driving the 7% comp this period and the 8% in the prior period? ", "Michael Casey", "It is really overall, and we\u2019ve made a point not to all out individual markets for comp store sales growth, but just to name two that are very significant due to their size, the U.K. has been very strong and Canada has been very strong. We have had strength in the rest of our business as well, but those have been the drivers because of the strength of the comp and the size of the market. ", "Howard Schultz", "Just a little color on the U.K., when we introduced the Starbucks Card in the U.K., and I think this bodes well for other international markets as well, we had a very similar response to the card from our U.K. customers that we had in the early stages of our U.S. business, and we saw a lift in business since that card has been launched. ", "I think again it demonstrates that there is a very similar way in which customer behavior responds to the Starbucks experience outside of North America and that Starbucks Card continues to be a very important marketing tool, customer loyalty tool. And the more we learn about how to use that card effectively with our U.S. business, the more effective it is going to be in leveraging the learning outside, and the U.K. is a great example. ", "I also want to mention we just are getting ready to open up our 700th store in Japan as well. If you look around the globe, despite the large numbers in Japan and the U.K., there isn\u2019t any market in the world that we are approaching anything close to market saturation, so as we look around, despite the fact that we are getting ready to open up before the end of the calendar year, other new markets, there is just so much opportunity for us in the markets that we are in. As we mentioned in the prepared text, China with its 500th store continues to be a very, very large prize for the company and we are in literally the embryonic stages of what we believe is going to be an enormous opportunity for our company and long-term for our shareholders. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt DiFrisco with Thomas Weisel Partners. ", "Matt DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I have a question, but first a bookkeeping request; can you give us the comp broken out by domestic and international from 2Q of \u201906, and then just tell us what you have upcoming in 3Q? ", "Michael Casey", "In the second quarter -- in the third -- you want the second quarter of \u201906? ", "Matt DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Yes, second quarter of \u201906 and 3Q as well. ", "Michael Casey", "In the second quarter of \u201906, the total company comp was 10%. The U.S. same-store sales growth was 10%, and the international same-store sales was 9%. That is Q2 of \u201906. ", "Matt DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, and then can you tell me what 3Q is, what we have coming up that we are going to be lapping now? ", "Michael Casey", "Yes, the total same-store sales growth was 6%, the U.S. was 9%, and international was 6%. ", "Matt DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. My question is with respect to the margins on the domestic side of the business, if I look at the overall basket, is it more of I guess the decline in the last two quarters, is it reflective of selling more food that might be coming out to be lower margin, or your comp just being a lower margin comp, or is it more so, or is there a productivity thing where maybe the new stores, the higher rent and you are yet to get the full volume off of that rent? So maybe the new store productivity is falling off a little bit, which would be the bigger reason for the margin decline. ", "Michael Casey", "I think the biggest reason is cost pressures. It is cost pressures in the area of wages, where we have invested in the wages of both our hourly and our management partners, and external pressure such as fuel and distribution charges, more so than any of the three things that you mentioned. ", "Matt DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Can you give us what your wage rate increase was in the quarter? ", "Michael Casey", "It was between 4% and 5%. ", "Matt DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Larry Miller with RBC Capital Markets. ", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets", "Michael, just to back up, my records show that you had a 6% comp in the third quarter in the U.S. and a 7% international. I think you might have said 9% in the U.S. Is that correct, a year ago? ", "Michael Casey", "That\u2019s what I said. ", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, sorry, I thought you might have said 9%. I had a question around dairy. Obviously dairy prices are rising -- ", "James L. Donald", "Hold on, hold on. ", "Michael Casey", "I did say 9%. I could be wrong but the sheet that I\u2019m reading says it was 6% consolidated, 9% in the U.S., and 6% in international in the third quarter of last year. Okay, so maybe my sheet is wrong. ", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because you\u2019d be closer to 9% then. ", "Michael Casey", "Yes. ", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets", "I guess you can clarify that later. ", "Michael Casey", "In any case, it\u2019s in last year\u2019s press release, and we can all look at it. ", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets", "I have 6 and 7, U.S. - international. I just want to ask about dairy costs. They are obviously rising right now. In the past, I think maybe in \u201905 you hedged, you had a swap on dairy. Are there any thoughts of doing that if dairy prices were to keep rising? ", "Michael Casey", "We did a very small, very small hedging operation with regard to dairy about 18 months ago, but we couldn\u2019t get sufficient interest from a counter party to make it be significant for us, and so that never amount to more than about 5% of our dairy usage, and it\u2019s trailed off. We are looking at other alternatives but we don\u2019t have one that I would say is likely in the immediate future. ", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glen Petraglia with Citigroup. ", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Thanks. Howard or Jim, I\u2019m curious to know what you guys think is the greatest challenge as you try to continue to grow in the U.S., let\u2019s call it high-teens to 20%. What are the greatest challenges that you face in trying to achieve that growth, and perhaps what sort of things might we see at the store level over the course of the next six to 12 months that might potentially reinvigorate transaction growth at the U.S.? ", "Howard Schultz", "First, I wouldn\u2019t extrapolate one month of flat transaction growth as the endpoint or conclusion that anyone should reach on this. If you look at the long history of Starbucks, transaction growth has been high single digits and we\u2019ve had low single digits, and so this is one quarter, one period. ", "As we look forward, specifically at the U.S. market and the opportunities that we have, we maintain our optimism and our belief that we are still in the early stages of the growth in terms of units. Certainly we\u2019ve said that by publicly saying that we believe that we can ultimately have close to 20,000 stores or more and we are not even close to that today, but in terms of the next six to 12 months specifically, I think we\u2019ve done a fairly good job in preparing for the summer, given the issues we faced last year. ", "I think operationally, we\u2019ve really taken a step back and looked at all the things that we faced last year and we are well-prepared, from an operational focus, and I think our food and beverage team have done a marvelous job in getting ready for innovative ways in which we are going to expose the market to new flavors. So we are prepared for a good summer. ", "And then, as we look to the fall and Christmas, those plans have been completely in place now for a while. We have some exciting things coming that I can\u2019t share with you on the phone today, but we feel really kind of locked and loaded for the summer, the fall and Christmas, and feel like we are in a very good place. ", "I think if you look at, if you take away from the quantitative issues just for a moment, the thing that strikes me about this quarter that I think is interesting that perhaps we are not discussing too much, is we get into the book business and we take a book that was going to have a printing of 9,000 copies before we get involved. It\u2019s a story that is a very tough story about a child soldier, and that book goes to number one two out of the last three weeks at the New York Times specifically because Starbucks became a market maker. It is not unreasonable to really look at us as a market maker on products and services. I think it demonstrates the unique power that we have in the marketplace from a brand position when we get behind something. And perhaps most importantly, the unique level of trust and confidence that our customers have. ", "I think specifically how that goes back to your question is we are examining lots of ways around coffee and our core business that we can leverage that trust around innovation and really build positions for the company that no other company can get close to because of the heritage and tradition. And then we are looking at day part more closely than ever before, unique products and services for those day parts that we feel in the past that we have not really focused on in terms of segmentation. ", "In short, this is kind of a long-winded answer, in short we feel really poised for the second half of the year to take advantage of the things that the summer, fall and Christmas season should provide us. ", "James L. Donald", "The only thing I would add to that is that as we go through quarter by quarter, actually month by month, quarter by quarter, we take a step back from each of these areas and we see and put our diagnostics skills on things we do well and things we don\u2019t do so well. I am sure one of the questions that are sitting out there is as we prepare for summer, what are we going to do different than we did last year? As we went through the summer selling season with cold-blended beverages, we talk about we had a bottleneck, if you will, in the a.m. due to an unusually large request of this product during that time period. ", "In order to continue to grow our business each and every day, just like we did then, we took a step back as soon as the season ended, we took a look at all of our stores, small and large volume stores, got the best practices on the cold-blended side of what these stores were doing, both in deployment of hours as well as the ergonomics, the flow, if you will, of the line-up behind the counter, and then we look at increasing the number of the cold beverage stations as well. ", "So that is just one example of the -- not difficulty, but the way we look at this business to continue to get and be in the range that we talk about each and every quarter. ", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Thanks. A question on international; you mentioned with regard to that segment that you are reinvesting in the infrastructure, which sounds a lot like building the pipeline. I wonder -- I know it\u2019s early to be talking about fiscal \u201908 and beyond, but this year you are I think 75% or so of your unit growth is domestic, and I\u2019m wondering if you could characterize if that percentage is going to be somewhat more international weighted next year, particularly with company stores? ", "Michael Casey", "I think in the relatively near future, the weighting is going to shift toward international, but it is not going to be rapid, mainly because we expect to continue to grow at a very rapid rate in the U.S. and we have the organization to do that. ", "International is a little bit like chasing a moving train. While those numbers are increasing, the U.S. business is going to continue to build stores and open new markets at a very rapid rate. So there will be a shift but it will be gradual. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Just a separate question; on the breakfast sandwiches, I\u2019m wondering how much of the drag on margins is really from the rollout and early adoption phases of these sandwiches, and how much of it is really just from the fact that you are selling more of these as a percentage of your overall sales? The reason I ask is because you are going to start to lap the initial rollout -- in the next one or two quarters, you started them rolling out last year, and I\u2019m wondering if that might provide some margin relief, or if we are just going to continue to see margins on the cost of sales line go the wrong way through fiscal \u201908 as you roll these out? ", "Michael Casey", "You raise a good point. The margin impact at the gross margin level, it will be fairly permanent. There is no question that the food and the merchandise, which we are building that business, has a lower gross margin than the handcrafted beverages, so there is a piece there that is somewhat structural, and a few tenths of a percent of revenue. ", "On an overall basis, however, as we get more stores and get more skilled at running the warming program and continue the refinements of the lunch program, there should be some relief in operating margin as a result of those two programs becoming more mature and we\u2019re more skilled at rolling them out. ", "James L. Donald", "We\u2019ve lapped areas now. ", "Michael Casey", "Yes, that\u2019s a good point, Jim. We\u2019ve lapped several markets and in those markets, we can see a definite year-over-year improvement in the warming program. But we also measure warming individually and in each market and it is contributing and it is producing a very satisfactory store level margin. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks, just a couple of quick ones; the first is actually on store pricing in the U.S. Many companies take pricing when they think their structural costs have gone up. Most of the world is in an inflationary commodity environment, inflationary labor environment. Could you make your comments on pricing as you begin to think about lapping over the current 1.5%-plus that you have in the stores now? ", "Howard Schultz", "We have no plans to increase prices at this time and don\u2019t believe that would be appropriate. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Second comment, we\u2019ve been hearing a lot in the last two weeks about some geographic weakness, specifically in markets like California and Florida. I\u2019ve seen you do very well in certain economies. ", "Howard Schultz", "Where did you hear that? Other Starbucks or other companies? ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Other companies. ", "Howard Schultz", "I\u2019m sorry. I thought you said it was us. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "In the last couple of weeks, a number of restaurant companies have mentioned it on their calls. Are you seeing any type of geographic trend that is interesting in the last few months like that? ", "James L. Donald", "Not anything that\u2019s interesting. Nothing to show a cause for concern. It\u2019s pretty consistent around geographic region to geographic region. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and the final question, Howard, maybe this will take more than a couple of seconds to answer, is on China. Certainly we look at the overall consolidated results and they do speak for themselves in terms of what your revenue growth is and what have you, but what can you provide us with, either qualitatively or quantitatively, in terms of how the China market is going for you and how rapidly perhaps you can grow it in the future and how meaningful you might think it could be to the global business in the next -- pick the number of years, three to five years. ", "Howard Schultz", "I\u2019ll start and Jim can pick up because he just returned last week from China. We have said almost very consistently throughout the last year or so that as we look around the world, like many other western companies and consumer brands, that China ultimately could potentially be the second-largest market in the world for Starbucks. ", "I think perhaps the main point that we can provide today is, which we couldn\u2019t do three or four years ago, and maybe even 18 months ago for that matter, is just the level of acceptance and perhaps the right word would be the relevancy of the Starbucks experience in China. ", "Depending on what number you believe, there is north of 200 million Chinese people and that number\u2019s growing, who we believe are the core customer today for Starbucks. I think what we\u2019ve been able to do is make sure that as we enter China and continue to do business there that we do not become a fad that becomes hot and then all of a sudden is out of favor, but most importantly that we integrate our company, the experience, and Starbucks\u2019 values into the lifestyle of the Chinese consumer and the behavior of how our customers are using the place. ", "I think what\u2019s probably most important is that not only have we achieved relevancy and success in the two most important major cities in Beijing and China, but now in I think 17 provinces, we have demonstrated throughout China and South China that Starbucks is going to be successful throughout greater China, and that includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. ", "And so the foundation we are building in terms of infrastructure, the investments we\u2019ve made, both in a Chinese-centric team based on China, as well as people with five and 10 and 15 years tenure from Starbucks U.S. that have moved to China, that we believe that this is going to be a big pay-off for the company at some point, and we are positioned as well as or perhaps better than most U.S. and western consumer brands that will be accepted and build a major business in China. ", "I can\u2019t give you the numbers because I think over time, not unlike the mistake we made early on in America, we underestimated the size of the market. We are trying not to do that. We are dreaming very big in China. We are investing heavily ahead of the growth curve. ", "I think from a shareholder perspective, this is really going to pay off because this is a very, very big prize and we think we are going to achieve it. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "How many stores are you opening a year now in China? ", "Howard Schultz", "I\u2019m looking to Michael to see if he\u2019s going to let me tell you the number. I think that the number that we have internally is about 100. If you look at the history of Starbucks, I think the one thing that you can really look at is that we have really under-promised and over-delivered when it\u2019s come to store count. ", "James L. Donald", "To that point, as I sat and talked to the Mayor of Guangzhou, and this is in southern China, and looked at that whole quarter of Shenzhen, Guangdong, and Guangzhou, I told the mayor that there is the potential of doubling those stores over the next 18 months to two years, and he said that\u2019s not fast enough, and he told me areas that quite frankly surprised me, and we look at it. ", "And the only reason I bring that up from a shareholder perspective is that when we go to these countries, when the government is asking us to become more of a part of the communities, when the customers at this conference that I was at talk about the Starbucks experience and talk about the ability to customize a beverage, it\u2019s the place to go. It tells me that we are well on our way. ", "But its\u2019 the combination of, as Howard said, investing ahead of the curve not only in infrastructure and people, but also in the communities that we are in because now we\u2019ve become \u201cplease come in and help us and we\u2019ll in turn give back to you\u201d, so it\u2019s really a great formula and it\u2019s a combination that\u2019s working. ", "Michael Casey", "Just one more point to make on that, in the last six months or so, we\u2019ve gained operational control of the Beijing market, which will allow us to have greater influence over the growth rate in that market. And in the last 12 months, we\u2019ve gained operational control in southern China and we have geared up both of those markets for more rapid growth than they\u2019ve experienced just six or 12 months ago. ", "Howard Schultz", "Martin Coles, the President of Starbucks International, is in the room and I think he wanted to just add something to your question about China. ", "Martin Coles", "Just for perspective on the new store growth, in China currently we are opening for every, for all of our international store count, roughly 20% of that count is actually new stores being opened in China. We expect there to be around 200 stores open in China during fiscal 2008 and I think again, looking forward, roughly 20% of our new store count will be in China. ", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Operator, that concludes the call for today. Before we shut down, I would like to just clarify the comps from last third quarter of fiscal \u201906, if I may please, back to an earlier question. The consolidated comp was 6%, the U.S. comp was 6%, and international was 7%, so I apologize for the error. ", "Thank you all for joining us today. We hope you will join us again. Next quarter we have our third quarter fiscal \u201907 financial results due to report on Wednesday, August 1st. Thank you very much.

Good afternoon everyone. Starbucks' third quarter performance demonstrates continued success in achieving a balance between driving strong top line growth, rapidly expanding our global reach, and delivering solid bottom line performance in a challenging environment. Our fundamentals remain strong in the investments and the steps that we're taking will maintain our momentum and continue to prepare us for the future. ", "We began to quarter of the year laying the groundwork for fiscal 2008 and beyond with a management realignment that will further bolster our operational focus in preparation for future growth, which I will discuss in greater detail later in the call. Michael will discuss our fiscal 2008 targets, which we believe demonstrate our ongoing confidence in the future of our business. ", "Let's take a look at the consolidated results for the third quarter of 2007. Today, we reported net revenues of $2.4 billion, up 20% from the same period in fiscal 2006; operating income of $245 million up 14% from a year ago; earnings per share of $0.21 compared to $0.18 a year ago, and we delivered comparable store sales growth of 4% for the quarter, a 3% increase in the average value per transaction and a 1% increase in transactions. ", "New store openings continued at a robust pace as we opened a third quarter record 668 stores, bringing our total to 14,396 locations in 42 countries. Included in this total is the opening of the 500th store with Seattle's Best Coffee location. This milestone reflects how Starbucks can successfully grow complementary platforms that reach a broader customer base. ", "It's important to note that even with more than 14,000 locations worldwide, we still see significant store development opportunity, both domestically and internationally. Going forward, we are committed to achieving a balance between growth, brand sustainability and presenting premium products to our customers, all while driving long-term shareholder value. This balance allows Starbucks to deliver a truly unique experience, whether you're visiting one of our retail stores in the U.S. or abroad, or if you are enjoying one of Starbucks' many products offered outside of our retail stores. ", "Let's take a look at the U.S. business. Company-operated U.S. retail revenue growth of 19% was driven by the opening of 1,116 new company-operated stores in the last 12 months. During the third quarter specifically, we opened 285 new company-operated locations. ", "Turning to comparable store sales growth for the U.S. segment, the third quarter saw trends similar to those in the second quarter. The average value per transaction increased 3% while traffic grew less than 1%, resulting in a 4% comparable store sales growth. During the quarter, sales of our core handcrafted espresso-based beverages and premium food offerings were the primary drivers of the growth in same-store sales. ", "Beverage is at the heart of what we do and offering our customers the variety that is uniquely Starbucks is what sets us apart from others. We are aggressively focusing our efforts on fewer, more powerful and differentiated beverage offerings and promotions going forward. This will reduce SKU count while driving profitability and business growth through both ticket and transaction. Our promotions will be more relevant, they will remain in our stores for a longer duration which ensures our customers and our baristas more time to experience, enjoy and connect over their favorite core or featured beverage. ", "Moving onto food, again this quarter we saw strong revenue contribution and an increase in average ticket from our food platform. During the quarter, we extended lunch to more than 260 additional U.S. locations. We also effectively enhanced our lunch offerings with innovative new selections of salads and wraps and extended our very successful parfait menu. Today, our lunch platform and its performance is stronger than ever, offering more variety and great tasting options based on fresh ingredients. At the end of the quarter, lunch was available at more than 4,600 stores, or 71% of our company-operated locations in the U.S. ", "During the quarter, we extended our warmed breakfast option to another 929 locations in the US, launching the program for the first time in Philadelphia, New Jersey, Delaware, and San Diego. At the end of the quarter, our warmed breakfast sandwiches were available to customers in more than 2,600 Starbucks locations in the U.S. That's approximately 41% of our U.S. company operated store base. We believe our food offerings enhance the Starbucks experience and this is proven by the strong customer acceptance that has translated into revenue generation and a higher average ticket. ", "The U.S. retail business provides a solid foundation for future growth as evidenced by the strong 19% year-over-year increase in company-operated U.S. retail revenue for the quarter. Over the next several years in the U.S., we expect to open approximately 1,700 new stores per year, which is the same as our fiscal 2007 target. We have worked hard to expand our internal store development capabilities and increase the number of U.S. stores that we open each year. We have demonstrated the success of those efforts through a meaningful ramp-up in store openings which has brought us to what we believe is an appropriate level of U.S. store openings at 1,700 stores annually. This current pace of openings will allow us to grow rapidly while managing the pressure that new stores put on existing stores. We continue to believe in and intend to capture the substantial opportunity to grow in the U.S. market. ", "Lastly from a margin perspective, we are experiencing rising dairy and supply chain costs. In response to these cost pressures, yesterday we implemented a price increase across our handcrafted and brewed beverages in our company-operated stores throughout the U.S. This increase varies by beverage and region and averages $0.09, or about 3% on beverage sales. ", "Moving on to music and entertainment, many of you recall that during the second quarter, Starbucks and Concord Music Group announced the formation of a new record label, Hear Music, and the first artist signed to the Hear Music label was none other than Paul McCartney. During the third quarter, Paul McCartney's Memory Almost Full debuted at number 3 on the Billboard Top 200 chart. This first release from the Hear Music label brought Paul his highest chart debut in 10 years. Additionally, last week, we announced our second artist signed to the Hear Music label, Joni Mitchell. Music has and always will be an important part of the coffeehouse culture and we look forward to presenting our customers with more unique entertainment options in the future. ", "Let me shift to the Global Consumer Products segment, which spans both the U.S. and international markets. During the third quarter, CPG reported net revenues of $87 million, up 24% from the third quarter of fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher sales volume of the packaged coffee. Starbucks remains the market leader in the U.S. premium packaged coffee segment with 7.5 million pounds sold during the third quarter, an 8% increase year over year. Seattle's Best Coffee achieved record market share with 1.7 million pounds sold, which is an increase of 35% over last year. ", "Within the U.S., the ready-to-drink category maintained its market leadership position and is a major component of CPGs' operating income. Beyond the U.S., a significant RTD growth opportunity exists within our international markets which continue to perform well ahead of our expectations. By the end of the fiscal year, we expect to achieve 99% distribution in convenience stores throughout Japan. Our RTD business in Japan has consistently grown through the third quarter, despite increased competition in that market. In May, we launched two Starbucks discovery flavors in Korea and have received strong customer acceptance. ", "With the addition of Starbucks discovery offerings to our existing bottled Frappuccino and Starbucks DoubleShot platforms in Korea, this is the first time all three RTD product lines are available in the same market. ", "In line with our goal of seeking new opportunities to extend the Starbucks brand into new products and channels, we recently announced an exciting new development and distribution agreement with Hershey's for the creation and marketing of a new Starbucks-branded premium chocolate platform in the United States. This alliance brings together two great brands to introduce distinctive and unique chocolate experiences to a broad range of channels, such as grocery and club. Those stores are the initial stores on the rollout. Hershey's chocolate expertise and distribution and selling capabilities, combined with Starbucks coffee expertise and the strength of our brand, will help transform the high-growth, premium chocolate arena. ", "This new agreement with Hershey's is another strategic alliance which showcases the ongoing development potential for our CPG segment. CPG represents an unprecedented opportunity to leverage our brand to additional consumer touch points beyond our retail stores. Our CPG product has built strong market share in the U.S. and we plan to continue this growth and expand this opportunity internationally. ", "Before I turn the call over to Martin, I'm going to take a few minutes to discuss our recent management realignment. A little over a year ago, I brought the senior management team together to discuss our long-term strategic plan, specifically challenging us to determine the best management structure in order to accomplish and support our aggressive growth objectives. The outcome from that initial discussion followed by significant planning led to these important changes. This new alignment was implemented to support the future growth and evolution of Starbucks as a global business, one we plan to double over the next four to five years, and to ensure we deliver a consistent Starbucks experience in all our stores throughout the world. ", "Importantly, this realignment also provides a strong example of the depth and the strength of our leadership team. We have hired people ahead of the growth curve and invested in their development and immersed them in the Starbucks culture and as a result, we've been able to complete this realignment entirely with current Starbucks leaders. This management structure positions us well to enhance the Starbucks experience worldwide through all of our business channels. ", "We will continue to do what we do best: serve premium quality coffee and introduce relevant, innovative, handcrafted beverages complemented by our expanded food offerings served in an inviting environment. We began as a small company in Seattle, we have grown into a global company with very ambitious goals, both financially and socially. These change the strength in our foundation and prepare us for our next phase of growth. ", "With that, Martin Coles, our new Chief Operating Officer, will review some key highlights from our international segment, a business that continues to strengthen, fueled by rapid retail expansion and healthy comparable store sales growth. Over the past several years, we have worked diligently to build a strong foundation for our international business to allow us to capture the significant opportunities ahead. While we have made great progress, we know we're still in the very early stages of international growth. I truly believe that we're in a great position to achieve sustainable growth well in the future. ", " Martin Coles", "Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm very happy to be with you here today to discuss the strong performance that we've seen in our international markets this quarter. I would like to remind you that it was less than four years ago that Starbucks Coffee International became a profitable business. Since then, we've driven accelerated store openings, we've delivered strong comparable store sales growth, 5% or more during every quarter; we've entered several new major market and we've increased equity ownership in select key markets. In essence, we've established the platform from which we believe Starbucks International will ultimately grow to at least five times our current size. ", "The timing couldn't be better for turning the International business over to Jim Alling, currently the President of our U.S. operations. Not only has Jim led the rapid expansion of the U.S. retail business for a number of years, but he has also driven significant growth in Starbucks foodservice and licensed businesses; on both of these areas, where building relationships with key industry partners is critical to success. This skillset, together with many others that Jim possesses, translates extremely well in Jim's new role where building relationships is a key component to our success. I look forward to continuing to work closely with Jim as we grow in existing markets, we open new markets, and ultimately, we operate as a truly global company. ", "In our record third quarter, International net revenues increased by 28% to $432 million when compared to the same period in fiscal 2006. Record levels of store openings, along with solid comparable store sales growth, drove this outstanding performance. This quarter, we opened nearly 200 locations in international markets, which included the opening of our 700th location in Japan. Our international operations delivered 7% comparable store sales growth for the third quarter, with a 5% increase in customer transactions, and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction or ticket. ", "So, now turning to new markets. During the quarter, we introduced Starbucks to Romania in the city of Bucharest, as well as opening airport locations in both the Netherlands, at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport and Denmark in Copenhagen's International Airport. While we've only opened a total of four stores in these markets, the extremely strong early reception demonstrates yet again the powerful global demand for the Starbucks experience. ", "This experience is especially true in Brazil, a market we opened just eight months ago and one that continues to see very strong customer acceptance which has driven positive brand perception in that market and where we now have five stores open. Excitingly, just recently, we announced Alsea, our long-term business partner in Mexico, the expansion of our business relationship to bring the Starbucks experience to Argentina. We're extremely positive about the opportunity that Argentina represents as it's the third largest economy in Latin America and has a very strong coffeehouse culture. We look forward to sharing our progress with you during future calls. As I mentioned, Alsea also manages Starbucks stores in Mexico where the business is performing extremely well and where the market has grown to nearly 140 locations in less than five years, a pace that has significantly exceeded our original expectations. ", "We are committed to building the foundation for long-term, sustainable growth and profitability internationally. We do expect variability in our international margins due to continuing investments in building the foundation for our newer markets, which include China and Brazil, as well as other countries where we will open in the near future, such as Russia before the end of this calendar year, and Argentina. You may have read that we recently withdrew our application to enter India as we refocus our efforts in Asia Pacific, which is a key region for our company, but we remain very excited about potential of this country and we plan to open that market in the next year or two. ", "As a growth company with a long-term perspective, we pay particular attention to the fine balance between managing short-term costs while continuing to invest for our future. Over the long term, we expect significant margin expansion in our International segments while we continue to invest ahead of the curve. During this period of rapid expansion, we will continue to strengthen our operations, our supply chain capability, and our new store pipeline. These efforts have been and will be applied to our total International segment regardless of ownership structure and assist us in achieving our goal of delivering a constant, consistent and excellent experience for our customers around the world. ", "We believe we have been successful internationally by focusing on making Starbucks stores a gathering place in neighborhoods throughout the world while building in appropriate localization to demonstrate our understanding and respect of local tradition. Our three largest markets of Canada, United Kingdom and Ireland and Japan are perfect examples of this practice with each performing exceptionally well and all three driving the consistent Starbucks experience our customers both expect and demand. ", "So, in closing, as Jim mentioned earlier, our International business is still in the very early stages of expansion and represents a tremendous source of growth for the company. At the end of the third quarter, we had more than 4,000 locations in International markets with a long runway ahead to reach our long-term target of at least 20,000 locations outside of the United States. We are confident in and we are energized about the future of the International business which is clearly demonstrated by our plans to increase store count by at least 20% per year over the next several years. ", "We see strong customer acceptance in every market we serve, from China, a strong tea drinking community to Brazil, a country with a long and solid coffee culture. We're driving success by focusing on the core elements that create the Starbucks experience for consumers around the world. Those core elements, not surprisingly, just as with the US, are great partners who create the human connection over premium quality coffee in our third-place environment. After ten years, our international journey is still in the very early stages and the best is yet come. ", "On a personal note, as I set out on the next leg of my Starbucks journey as Chief Operating Officer, I'm humbled and I'm honored at the same time at the privilege and I'm extremely mindful of the responsibility this new role carries. Starbucks is a pioneer in developing the specialty coffee market, something that never existed in the marketplace before. I'm very excited to help take our company into the next very important stage of growth and I look forward to speaking with you in the near future. ", "So, with that, Michael will now review our financial results for the quarter. ", "Michael Casey", " Thank you, Martin. Today, I will provide additional detail on some of the significant factors that impacted our financial performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, review our targets for the remainder of fiscal 2007 and introduce the company's growth targets for fiscal 2008. ", "Consolidated top line growth for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was 20%, with 4% comparable store sales growth, both consistent with our stated targets. Consolidated earnings per share were $0.21 in the third quarter compared to $0.18 for the comparable period in fiscal 2006, representing an increase of 17%. External cost pressures, primarily within the U.S. business, challenge the flowthrough to earnings. ", "Consolidated operating income increased 14% to $240 million for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2007, from $215 million in the prior year. As a percentage of total net revenues, operating margin declined to 10.4% from last year's third quarter margin of 10.9%. This decline was due to higher cost of sales, including occupancy, offset in part by leverage gained in general and administrative expenses, store operating expenses and other operating expenses. ", "Consolidated cost of sales, including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased to 42.6% from 41.0%, driven primarily by higher costs in our U.S. business, which I will discuss in that segment. In addition, flowthrough to earnings was negatively impacted by net interest and other expense in the current quarter due to higher borrowings outstanding, compared to net interest and other income in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, as well as a higher effective tax rate this year. While the third quarter effective tax rate was lower than the two prior fiscal 2007 quarters, we do still expect the effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to be approximately 37%. ", "Let me now move to third quarter results for our operating segments. For the U.S. operating segment, total net revenues increased by 18% to $1.8 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Company-operated retail revenues rose 19% to $1.6 billion for the quarter, driven by the opening of 1,116 new company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 4% for the quarter. The growth in same-store sales was driven by a 3% increase in average value per transaction and growth in transactions of less than 1%. ", "U.S. specialty revenues grew by 11% to $194 million in the third quarter. Within specialty revenues, licensing revenues increased 14% to $110 million, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 777 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. ", "U.S. cost of sales, including occupancy costs, as a percentage of total revenues increased to 40.3% compared to 38.6% in the comparable period a year ago. This was primarily due to the following three factors: First, higher dairy costs which caused approximately 50 basis points of the increase. In June, Class 1 dairy prices were 66% higher than the prior year and are expected to be approximately 100% higher than the prior year in August and September. Second, a shift in our sales mix to higher-cost products, primarily food and merchandise, which also contributed approximately 50 basis points to the increase. Third, higher rent expense, which similar to last quarter, was due to several factors, including growth in higher-priced commercial real estate markets. We expect these trends to continue in the fourth quarter. ", "U.S. store operating expenses improved 70 basis points to 41.5% of related U.S. retail revenues, resulting primarily from a sharpened focus on discretionary spending, particularly within regional overhead, and leverage from the October 2006 price increase. Partially offsetting these reductions were higher payroll-related expenditures in fiscal 2007 stemming from the company's October 2006 wage increase for hourly store partners and the second quarter salary increase for our store management partners. ", "U.S. other operating expenses improved to 26.7% of related specialty revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 from 29.1% in the prior year, primarily due to lower marketing and advertising costs in the current year related to the entertainment business, and again, controlled discretionary spending. ", "U.S. general and administrative expenses as a percentage of U.S. total net revenues declined to 1.2% from 1.6%, primarily due to decreased salary and related benefits expenses and lower professional fees for special projects. ", "U.S. operating income increased to $253 million during the quarter from $225 million during the same period of fiscal 2006 due to the cost pressures I mentioned earlier in cost of sales and occupancy. Operating margin decreased to 13.8% of related revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 from 14.5% a year ago. ", "As Jim noted, we implemented a price increase on beverages in our U.S. retail stores yesterday to help offset the impact of steeply rising dairy costs this calendar year. We have discussed these rising costs on the past two earnings calls and dairy has clearly been prevalent in the media for the past few months so we know this is no surprise to you. We look at price increases as one of the several tools we have available to help offset rising costs and one that we execute thoughtfully and carefully to protect our brand and the health of our business. However, we also recognize that the price increase could have a modest negative impact on transaction growth. ", "We anticipate that the net benefit of approximately of the 3% price increase on beverages, combined with controlled spending across the business, will offset the fourth quarter impact of higher dairy costs year-over-year. ", "Turning now to the International segment. International total revenues increased 28% to $432 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. International company-operated retail revenues increased 30% to $365 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, mainly due to the opening of 253 new company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months; comparable store sales growth of 7% for the quarter and favorable foreign exchange for the British pound sterling. The comparable store sales increase resulted from a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions, coupled with a 2% increase in the average value per transaction, reflecting another quarter of strong growth in our International retail business. ", "International specialty revenues for the quarter increased 18% to $67 million, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 466 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. ", "International operating income was $32 million in the third quarter, compared to $29 million in fiscal 2006. The operating margin decreased to 7.5% of related revenues from 8.6% in fiscal 2006. The year-over-year margin compression was primarily due to increased costs associated with store renovation and maintenance expenses and higher rent expense as a percentage of total revenue. Also impacting the margin was an increase in utility costs due to rising energy prices and consumption. ", "International general and administrative expenses as a percentage of International total revenues improved 40 basis points, demonstrating the beginning of leverage from our investments. Over time, we expect further leverage from investments in our International business and significant margin improvement in fiscal 2008. ", "Now, a few comments on our third business segment, Global Consumer Products Group. CPG total net revenues increased 24% to $87 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. This was driven primarily by increased sales of packaged coffee and tea in the U.S. Also contributing to revenue growth in this segment was increased product sales and royalties in the international ready-to-drink business. ", "Our packaged coffee and tea and ready-to-drink businesses demonstrate the vast opportunity within CPG. The premium packaged coffee and tea business, which has built leading market share over time in the U.S., is in its very early stages of international expansion. Similarly, our RTD business in international markets is relatively new and in a short time has had a notable impact with plenty of room to grow. ", "Operating income for CPG was $42 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to $39 million in fiscal 2006. The operating margin decreased to 48.1% of related revenues from 55.6% in fiscal 2006, primarily the result of lower sales volumes for the North American Coffee Partnership which produces ready-to-drink beverages, including Starbucks' bottled Frappuccino coffee drinks and Starbucks' DoubleShot. ", "Now, I want to make a few comments on Starbucks' balance sheet and capital structure. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, Starbucks repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock under authorized share repurchase programs. This brings total share repurchases for the first three quarters of the fiscal year to 20.3 million shares, and the total year-to-date cost to the company was $671 million. The number of shares remaining available for repurchase under authorized plans at the end of the third quarter was approximately 26 million. ", "As we mentioned in our second quarter 2007 10-Q filing, with limited borrowing capacity remaining in the under the company's credit facility, significant additional share repurchases in excess of cash flow was limited in the third quarter, absent any additional borrowing authorizations. With that in mind, management is currently evaluating a range of alternatives for raising long-term financing to enable Starbucks to pay down short-term debt and to take advantage of opportunities for repurchasing shares. ", "In determining the appropriate capital structure for the company, we consider how additional debt and stock repurchases would increase distribution to shareholders and reduce our cost of capital. But we also evaluate our cash flow and how much financial flexibility we should retain, given our high rate of growth and the possible opportunities that lie ahead of us. Balancing these two factors, we believe that leverage and coverage ratios roughly commensurate with a high triple-B credit rating, are appropriate for the company. ", "Given the opportunistic nature of our stock repurchase program, you might see short-term moderate deviations away from our average credit ratio levels. If this were to occur, we would plan to restore our credit ratios back to the normal levels over a short to medium term. ", "I'd now like to turn to our fiscal 2007 targets. We're targeting the opening of at least 2,400 new stores on a global basis with modest upside potential in international licensed store openings given the strong year-over-year performance in store development to date. We continue to expect comparable store sales growth in the 3% to 7% range and we continue to expect total net revenue growth of approximately 20%. We continue to target earnings per share in the range of $0.87 to $0.89. However, as I recently commented, the upper end of that range will be very challenging, given the current operating environment, which includes, among other things, rising dairy costs and soft transaction growth in our U.S. business. ", "I will now share with you our first look at our fiscal 2008 financial targets. Over the past few years, we have continued to bolster our store development capabilities which has allowed us to increase store openings consistently over time. We will continue this growth pattern in fiscal 2008 as we plan to ramp up our store openings to approximately 2,600 net new stores on a global basis, an increase of 200 stores compared to our fiscal 2007 target. ", "Our International store openings will accelerate while the level of U.S. store openings will stabilize at 2007 levels. Accordingly, in the United States, we plan to open approximately 1,000 company-operated locations and 700 licensed locations. In International markets, we plan to open approximately 300 company-operated stores and 600 licensed stores. We expect comparable store sales growth in the range of 3% to 7%. We're targeting total net revenue growth of approximately 18% and we are targeting earnings per share growth faster than revenue growth at approximately 20% to 22%. ", "With that, I would like to ask the operator to queue the first question. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers. ", " Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", " Just a question on the U.S. traffic, which was obviously a hot topic last quarter. Seems to have been modestly positive, but still looks like a deceleration on a two-year average basis from the prior quarter or two. Just wondering if you can give some color commentary in terms of your thoughts, whether you believe the further consequential lease sale was due to macro factors -- which are obviously impacting all of retail -- or whether it's something more Starbucks-specific. ", "Whichever it is, where do you see it heading from here and do you think increase in pricing, what kind of impact is that going to have on the traffic? I know you mentioned it was kind of negative in the near term. Thanks. ", "Michael Casey", " Well, you're correct to pick up on the fact that the U.S. traffic was slightly better in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter, but continues to be impacted by a number of factors. There's not a single thing that impacts the traffic. It is important to note that there was not a decline in the traffic count, but it was steady with last year. ", "It's clear that there is an increased competitive environment. There is an increased pressure on consumers from macroeconomic factors. But in all of those areas, we believe that we have a competitive advantage of being the coffee experts and being able to generate incremental traffic as we go forward, particularly in our core beverages, our core espresso beverages and the things that are uniquely Starbucks. ", "Jim Donald", "I will add to that the differentiation is still going to be what we call the Starbucks experience as we continue to innovate around our core beverages, and as I mentioned, give our partners, our baristas, more time to connect with the core of coffee of what we're offering for our customers, and also the connection with our customers. ", " Howard Schultz", " Jim, I would add one other thing, and that is that the equity of the Starbucks brand over the last two decades has been defined by the experience. As long as we can continue to drive that experience and differentiate ourselves from all others, we will continue to be the leader. We have no intention whatsoever of giving that leadership position away. ", "Jim Donald", " Thank you, Howard. ", " Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", " So to follow-up with the 3% price increase on the beverages, I know you mentioned it could have a near-term negative impact on traffic. I'm just kind of wondering (1) , whether that has the potential to push traffic negative, kind of what's the balance between what you think a 3% price increase would do to traffic? Whether it's one-to-one or slightly more, slightly less? ", "Jim Donald", " I made that comment, and I did it to acknowledge the fact that we recognize the possibility. Historically, we have not had a significant decrease in traffic as a result of price increases early in the price increase cycle. We think that there's been modest negative impact on traffic over an extended period of time from a price increase followed by recovery. At higher levels of same-store sales growth, those minor changes have been pretty much not noticeable. ", "We're not expecting a significant traffic decline with the coming price increase, but we recognize that it's the first time we've taken two price increases as close together as these two and just want to acknowledge the possibility that it might have a short-term negative impact on traffic. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners. ", " Matthew DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel ", " Just looking at a couple of the drivers to fiscal 3Q on the margin front, labor, and you used controlled discretionary spending as a reference in store operating expense; and then also with the lower advertising with respect to the other operating expense line as well as things that helped you a little bit in the third quarter. ", "Are these things that are going to come back in the fourth quarter as expense lines and somewhat deferred, or were they basically rationalized and not going to come back on the income statement? ", "Michael Casey", " Well, I think you mentioned three things, one of which was higher year-over-year, and that's the salary and benefits within the store operating expenses. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, that's directly due to the across the board wage increase that we implemented, and to the increase for our management personnel in the second quarter. So, that is likely to continue. ", "The controlled discretionary spending I think is a discipline that we have been developing over the last six to 12 months, and I would definitely expect it to continue. We're learning how to be more effective and to control those expenses fairly tightly. ", " Matthew DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel ", " How about the marketing dollars? What's the relationship? ", "Michael Casey", " The marketing that I mentioned is primarily related to our entertainment business where we were spending against Akeelah and the Bee at this time a year ago and we didn't have a similar promotion or a similar activity in the stores this year. ", " Matthew DiFrisco - Thomas Weisel ", " Just as a follow-up, longer-term as we think out into '08 and beyond, in this new direction, with maybe a flat line number of stores opening domestically and just the overall maturation of your store base domestically, how fast do you think we can get back to, or is it correct to assume that we should be looking towards a 16% margin again in the U.S. side of the business in '08 possibly? ", "Michael Casey", " I think that's a little bit too difficult to predict. We do expect total company margin improvement in 2008 compared to 2007, and we do expect modest margin improvement within our U.S. business. Beyond that, I don't think it's appropriate to get any more specific at this time. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ashley Woodruff - FBR Capital Markets. ", " Ashley Woodruff - FBR Capital Markets", "On your comment on slowing the U.S. store growth modestly, you mentioned cannibalization as one of the issues. Historically when you've opened new stores, you've always typically cannibalized existing stores. Is the difference now that the stores that were cannibalized, were they not ramping up as much, or is it just the new stores aren't I guess opening at the same type of volumes? ", "Jim Donald", " If you look at the cannibalization factor today as we did several years ago, and it's more in pockets than it is across the company, but, we're seeing in these pockets certain cannibalization dependent upon where those stores are located. But we don't see this as an issue that basically overrides the opportunities that we see for continuing our growth. ", "As we go forward, we're going to continue to infill markets where the opportunities exist, factoring in some form of potential cannibalization in our plans, whether they are total overall revenue or 3% to 7% comps.

Michael, are you going to be running around 5% or so price in the fiscal fourth quarter, is that correct? ", "Michael Casey", " No, that's not correct. Thank you for bringing that up. I did want to clarify that. We have an effective price increase of approximately 1.5% prior to today and an approximately 2.5% price increase that was implemented yesterday. So, that's a total of about 4%. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs. ", " Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Just going back to the U.S. traffic number, one of the reasons you cited was competition. It seems as though in your prepared remarks, you talked about going back your core beverage business perhaps with renewed vigor and trying to increase the differentiation factor. Can you first comment on are you allocating increased resources to this product development cycle? And you also mentioned SKU count reduction. Are you pulling items as we speak from your menus? ", "Jim Donald", " What we've done is, we're not allocating resources directly into the R&D piece, but we've taken the whole R&D piece on a global basis now and we're leveraging synergies across the world into creating this innovation platform that won't be necessarily U.S. or international in nature, but altogether. There's not additional resources that are being put into that, other than through the normal course of business. ", "The reduction in whether it's promotion or SKUs are basically looking at running our business in a way that our partners can continue to complement the Starbucks experience through the connection with the customers, through each other, through the partners, but also to make sure that the speed with service, getting our customers in and out of our stores as well as the quality of the beverage is improved. We think that by creating less complexities that we'll give our partners more time to achieve this. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird.

Baird", " Could you give us an update on the effectiveness of the changes that you made in managing the cold-blended business this year versus last year, and how that might benefit traffic in the current quarter? ", "Jim Donald", " Compared to last year, we believe through training and education that we have completely resolved any traffic issues related to execution in blended beverages. I think the impact was both in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter last year. So, we do not expect any impact from that whatsoever. ", " Howard Schultz", "That was done in different factions, whether it was using best practices, looking at the deployment when those beverages were being sold, as well as rolling out additional cold-blended beverage stations, a little over 2,000 stores this year versus 900 stores last year.

", " John Glass - CIBC World Markets", " Last year, you talked at the analyst meeting about a 20% top line and 20% to 25% bottom growth rate for three to five years, and now you're talking about 18% top line and 20% to 22%, at least for '08. I guess my question is then, is this a permanent slowdown in the growth rate of your business in your view, or is it just the recognition that there are some temporary pressures both on the top and bottom line and we might resume that 20% to 25% in the future? ", "Included in that answer, could you talk about, are you assuming greater leverage in getting to the 20% to 22% earnings growth rate, either next year or in the future? ", "Michael Casey", " Well, we are expecting leverage and we are expecting to grow the bottom line faster than the top line. The change from 20% to 25% to 20% to 22% is basically a refinement and recognizing what our capabilities are, and perhaps at 25% we had put more strain on the system than we needed to. But we still think the 20% to 22% is a world-class growth rate for a large company like ourselves and we are just going to strive to maintain that going forward. ", "I don't expect that the bottom line growth rate, absent some transformation in the business, is going to reaccelerate up to the 25% level again, but it's certainly not impossible and it could happen in any given year. I wouldn't plan on it consistently over a number of years. ", " Howard Schultz", " Michael, when you add into the factor that we're going to increase our international business five times more than it is today, we're going to double the size of the company in four to five years, some of these issues are just the law of large numbers. If you really get underneath and look at the way in which the company is growing and the runway that we have, I think it's really important to point out how optimistic we are about the opportunities we have and how I think going back two, three, four years, the question was about international, whether or not we could extend the Starbucks platform and equity of the experience internationally. Now, there's no question that that is here and we've got a strong runway to take advantage of it. ", "So I really would not get hung up on whether it's 18% or 19% or 20%. On a macro level, there are very few consumer brands and certainly very few consumer retail companies that have the opportunity we have to build a global business from the size we are today.

", " Sharon Zackfia - William Blair", " Yes, in terms of just growing so quickly in the U.S. ", "Jim Donald", " Well, first of all, our partners tell us if there's areas out there such as the complexities or the growing too fast, I mean, when you look at every component of our business, whether it's store development where we now have a pipeline out 18 to 24 months, whether it's this innovative pipeline that we said in the past, we have probably over 100 particular promotions or items in that pipeline, we don't see the strain there. ", "We see the strain where we try to maybe accelerate it too fast without having that focus at store level or the bench that's in place. I want to say that we've basically satisfied our bench and the need to listen to our partners to reduce some of those complexities to eliminate some of that internal strain. But, I won't say that that's creating any kind of angst in terms of business. ", "On the external front, when you look at what you might call the competitive environment, we're seeing this category of super-premium coffee being offered now in more locations than ever before. But, we see that as a positive step in that the coffee category is large. Super-premium is small but growing. But if that continues to populate itself with different independent coffeehouses or QSRs, that's a good thing. I think it bodes well for all the sellers of super-premium quality coffee. So, from that competitive strain, I think that we're not seeing that as necessarily something that's pushing against the sides, but actually helping to fuel us as we continue to grow. ", "Michael Casey", "To further that, when we look at the places where you would think the competitive pressures would be the greatest, in most cases, that's where we are performing the best. So, while we can't totally eliminate any impact from competitors, every time we look to pin it down or to identify it, the analysis turns out it's just the opposite; that the markets where the identified competitors are strongest is where we're the strongest. ", "Jim Donald", " U.S. and international. ", "Michael Casey", "Yes, both international and U.S. ", " Howard Schultz", " Michael, let's get a little more specific about that. I think what I would like to just try to explain is, the coffee category, the specialty coffee category, despite the growth and development of Starbucks and others, it's still in its infant stages and as we've talked in previous years, we have less than 10% share of total coffee consumption in North America, less than 1% internationally. ", "What we've seen, as Michael and Jim have just talked about in specific areas where there's been more awareness created by others, whether it's advertising or promotion over the short and long term, we have benefited and we've seen that specifically in U.S. markets and we've certainly seen it in international. ", "So, this whole cloud that many have tried to create about competitive pressures forcing us to slow down our growth or look at cannibalization differently is really not the case and this is just a moment in time when we're looking at our business perhaps in a different way, which is appropriate and I think timely. ", "Also, because of the international opportunity, we have the opportunity to stabilize the U.S. growth at 1,700 stores and take advantage of the huge opportunity we have internationally, which is in its embryonic stage. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glen Petraglia - Citigroup. ", " Glen Petraglia - Citigroup ", " Just going back to cannibalization, going back six or nine months ago you were speaking about filling in markets and you're continuing talking about filling in markets. But clearly, flat to modestly up transactions in the last few quarters have surprised you, and you've made the comments about opening up a consistent 1,700 units a year which would in essence reduce cannibalization or eliminate some of the pressures on your existing stores. ", "Has the rate of cannibalization this year surprised you, and what sort of implications does that have going forward? ", "Jim Donald", " Glen, we were talking about cannibalization many years ago and basically looking at the same impact that it would have on these stores that we were opening when we were opening 300 to 400 stores. What we're seeing today as we look at all of the drivers, and we've mentioned earlier on the call, be it macroeconomic conditions or whatever the cause may be, is cannibalization today is about the same impact as it was many, many years ago. So we don't necessarily see that. ", "As Howard mentioned, as this super-premium category gets larger, we're seeing the opportunities in all of our market areas still continuing to be in the very early stages. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns. ", " Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns ", "First, the cost side on the G&A side, you've really done a great job controlling costs. Are there more opportunities to cut costs year-over-year, short-term fourth quarter? How do we think about 2008 on that front? ", "And then one on the International side. Your International company openings, I noticed you're holding flat, you're holding stable for 2008. Also, it looks like you might be struggling a little bit or have a lot of openings in the fourth quarter to make your '07 number. So if you could comment on that. ", "International operating income growth, fairly modest again this quarter. So, if you would address that as well. ", "Michael Casey", " I will take the first one about the opportunity to cut costs. I think we've developed a good cost control mentality that allows us to get leverage in the fixed cost areas without choking the growth of the business. 20% top line growth consistently year in and year out cannot be achieved if you have a cost-cutting mentality. ", "Our mentality has been to maintain modest growth and to leverage the people that we have and to leverage the facilities that we have. So I think going forward, you can continue to expect to see leverage on unallocated corporate G&A, U.S. G&A, and international G&A, but not cuts from, on an absolute basis, from the current level because that would in essence make it much more difficult for you to achieve the top line growth that we have targeted for ourselves. ", " Martin Coles", " Hi, Joe, thanks for the question internationally. We are actually running at an all-time record in terms of store openings if you look at the entire fiscal year, and this touches virtually every one of our countries, whether they're licensed operations, JV's, or wholly owned. ", "The other piece that we've accelerated just for perspective is the rate at which we touch the stores for a refurb. So we actually again are running at record levels there. I don't see that changing frankly as we go into 2008. So we see ourselves significantly ramping up in 2008. ", "Michael had mentioned as we believe there's probably some positive even to our own estimates as we get to the last couple of months of this year. So, we're building as fast as we can in the right way into the right locations in every international market, whether it's company-owned or whether it's license or JV. Again, we're doing more work than ever before just in terms of making sure that we touch the stores and refurbish the stores on a very aggressive program. So we're able to keep the experience fresh for our customers in every country in the world. ", "Michael Casey", " If you notice the numbers that I referred to on how many stores in the various categories that we've opened in the last 12 months, the U.S. businesses actually has a trailing 12 months run rate higher than next year's target in both licensed stores and in company-owned stores. So, we feel very solid about those run rates and that capability and capacity, and that's as a result of having consciously ramped up that capacity and capability over the last three or four years from a time when we were opening maybe 1,000 stores not that long ago in the U.S. market in total. ", "International is going through that same phase and it would be natural to expect on a quarter-over-quarter basis in general there to continue to ramp up. So we're not at next year's run rate yet, but we're taking the steps that we will get us to next year's run rate in time to deliver our next year's targets. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Andrew Barish - Banc of America. ", " Andrew Barish - Banc of America", "Just a question really pertaining to the U.S. business, as you get to a little bit more of a level of maturity here with the comps. Have you guys thought about the marketing/advertising strategy? Are there any thoughts on maybe stepping that up in different ways than you've done in the past? ", "Jim Donald", " In the past and from day one, our marketing and advertising strategy is one that is envied by many and it's one that's basically been built through our grassroots efforts of our store partners and the connections they have with their customers. ", "We have done external advertising, such as billboards during the holiday seasons and through our CPG business, we have done some type of cable presentations for our bottled Frappuccino and DoubleShot. But we don't necessarily see the need to take that investment. As we grow our store base, we continue to grow our presence in our communities around the world and the Starbucks experience that we continue to see, as Howard mentioned in the call, is completely different than the rest of our competitors as a way to market Starbucks and continue to drive transaction count. ", " JoAnn DeGrande", " That concludes our third quarter earnings call today.

In achallenging operating environment, we have demonstrated resiliency and discipline.With that said, there are areas of opportunity within our control to deliverbetter performance.", "We ended the fiscal year with encouraging trends andmomentum in our International business, and we believe we are in a solidposition to continue these trends into this new fiscal year.", "We face challenges in our U.S. business, as do others, butwe believe we are addressing them and strengthening our business.", "Today, I will briefly walk you through our fourth quarterand fiscal year accomplishments, as well as challenges and opportunities for usas we move into 2008.", "Let me begin with a summary of some of the key highlights ofthe fourth quarter and the fiscal year.", "We reported net revenues of $2.4 billion for the quarter, up22% from the same period in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 net revenues reached $9.4billion, a 21% increase over last year.", "Operating income for the fourth quarter was $248 million, up25% from a year ago and $1.1 billion for the year, an 18% increase year overyear.", "We delivered earnings per share of $0.21 for the quarter,compared to $0.15 per share a year ago and for the full year, EPS was $0.87compared to $0.71 in 2006 and we delivered comparable store sales growth of 4%for the quarter, driven by a 4% increase in the average value per transaction.For the full year, comparable store sales growth was 5%, comprised of a 1%increase in transactions and 4% growth in the average value per transaction.", "New store openings continued at a good pace as we opened 615stores in the fourth quarter to end the year with more than 15,000 stores in 43countries.", "As we enter fiscal 2008, we continue to examine the stepsnecessary to both capture the significant long-term opportunity that existsglobally, while we deliver on our financial targets for the year. Early in thefourth quarter, we took a step in this direction with the realignment of ourexecutive management team, which included the addition of a chief operatingofficer.", "Our team is sharpening our focus on operational executionwhile supporting our long-term growth. We have developed a strong bench ofleaders, as evidenced by this realignment which was accomplished entirely withinternal candidates.", "Martin Coles, who recently led our International business,is now our COO. His proven expertise in global operational excellence isinvaluable and we look for his lead in optimizing day-to-day operations as wecontinue our global expansion.", "Launi Skinner, our new president of the U.S. business, hasbeen a Starbucks partner since 1993 and has served in a number of increasinglycritical operations positions in the field. Most recently, she held aleadership role in Store Development, guiding the U.S. business through itssignificant store growth.", "And Jim Alling, who led the rapid expansion of the U.S.retail business, is now leading our international business, where he bringsstrong operational experience not only in our retail business but also in foodservice and licensed partnerships.", "Turning to U.S. retail, we will spend considerable time on today\u2019scall discussing the challenges and opportunities in this business.  But before we do that, I want to quicklyacknowledge some of the accomplishments for the fourth quarter and the year.", "Of note, U.S. retail delivered 19% revenue growth for boththe fourth quarter and the full year. During the year, we opened a total of1,065 net new company-operated retail stores and within that total, wecontinued to grow our drive-Thru presence to meet the convenience needs of ourcustomers.", "There remains significant opportunity for our drive-thrumodel in North America. We like both the geographic expansion options and theattractive unit economics of this store format. We ended the year with nearly2,200 drive-thru locations, making up more than 30% of our U.S. company-operatedstore base.", "We ended the year with warming in over 3,000 U.S. locations,an increase of nearly 2,400 stores during the year. We also expanded our lunchprogram by more than 1,000 locations. Lunch is now available in more than 70%of our U.S. company-operated retail store base.", "During the fourth quarter, we entered into a strategicalliance with Apple, allowing our customers to digitally download music fromthe iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store at participating Starbucks locations.", "The Starbucks Card reached two key milestones during theyear, driven by our activity in our U.S. company-operated locations. For thefirst time, customers both loaded and redeemed more than $1 billion during afiscal year. To put that into context, it took three years from the time welaunched the card for customers to load the first billion dollars.", "Turning to comparable store sales for the U.S. segment, inthe fourth quarter we saw transaction trends decelerate from those experiencedin the second and third quarters. The average value per transaction increased5% in quarter four, while traffic decreased by 1%, resulting in a 4% comparablestore sales growth. For the full fiscal year, U.S. retail delivered 4%comparable store sales growth, nearly all driven by the average value pertransaction.", "While we did report U.S. comparable store sales within ourstated range for the consolidated business both for the quarter and the year,we did it through two price increases and we recognize that theflat-to-negative trends needs to be addressed.", "The pressure we are seeing on the traffic isn\u2019t entirelyunexpected considering the challenging operating environment and similar trendsreported across both the retail and restaurant industry. It is apparent thatour customers are feeling the impact of the economic slowdown.", "We believe the combination of this slowdown and the priceincreases we implemented in 2007 to help mitigate significant cost pressureswithin our business, such as dairy, have impacted the frequency of customer visitsto our stores.", "Despite that, we believe there are opportunities within ourcontrol to increase traffic into our stores and today, we will share with youspecific initiatives underway to do just that. I will outline the general areaswe are working on and then Martin will expand upon these initiatives in hisremarks.", "First, the greatest opportunity for us is to sharpen ourfocus on our core business and be uncompromising when it comes to executing toour standards. We built this brand and quite candidly this industry on theStarbucks Experience, connecting with our customers by delivering the highestquality coffee and hand-crafted beverages in a warm and inviting storeenvironment.", "While we have not been executing consistently to ourstandards, we are committed to getting back to those levels.", "Second, we have a significant opportunity to attract morecustomers to our stores through avenues not tapped by us historically.", "And, third, we plan to drive beverage sales by recapturingthe consistent quality our customers expect from our core beverage line-up anddelivering meaningful innovation. This focus will result in new products thatreflect our core high-quality, handcrafted beverages. We remain committed todelivering high-impact innovations that surprise and delight our customers andincrease traffic in our stores.", "To help with this focus, we\u2019ve also re-examined the velocityat which we are opening new stores in the U.S. and decided to further reviseour fiscal 2008 U.S. company-operated store opening target. We now plan to open900 company-operated and 700 licensed locations in the U.S. this year. Byreducing the pace, we expect to improve our ability to select both the locationand the store format that are the best fit for our customers and the business.", "Before I turn the call over to Martin, I want to address thegrowing level of interest of others to participate in the specialty coffeeindustry, as well as the economic trends. I think it is important to discuss these issues side by side to ensureappropriate weight is given to the challenging operating environment and toemphasize that we remain the clear leader in this industry.", "Starbucks built this market and the customer awareness,which has resulted in a growing demand for specialty coffee in the U.S. We arein the enviable position of having an incredibly loyal customer base, somethingthat we work hard to preserve day in and day out.", "We have delivered years of strong results because we havedifferentiated ourselves in a way that can\u2019t be duplicated. Considering thechallenging macroeconomic factors, our call to action at this time is to ensurethat we are consistently executing against the unparalleled StarbucksExperience on which the brand and our customers\u2019 loyalty was built.", "With our renewed focus, we believe we are poised to not onlymaintain our leadership position during these tough economic times but tocapture significant growth in this business for the years to come.", "I want to emphasize that we believe we have a solid grasp onthe opportunity for substantial growth, that we are in a position of strengthto be able to execute our strategic plan and deliver long-term shareholdervalue.", "We are keenly aware of the current economic conditions andhave a great respect for the competitive landscape but we believe theopportunity is within our control. We remain committed to our global growthstrategy and continue to see significant potential to broaden our footprintboth domestically and outside the U.S.", "We are also committed to executing on our growththoughtfully, strategically and with a disciplined approach to ensure we meetour profit and return targets.", "I\u2019m now going to turn the call over to Martin, who will walkyou through more details on specific initiatives slated for fiscal 2008. Martin.", "Martin Coles", "Great. Thank you, Jim and good afternoon everyone. Let me starttoday by stressing that from an execution perspective, we are already workingon many of the initiatives that Jim has just outlined for you, the first ofwhich is a significantly enhanced focus on operational excellence andconsistency.", "Consistent execution of our standards means reducingcomplexity to free up time for our operators in the field to get closer to ourcustomers. This includes fewer and more powerful promotions, SKUs and newprograms rolled out to our stores.", "In other words, what we internally call focusing on thevital few, those areas of focus that truly make the difference in winning theloyalty of our customers. We are also providing our field leadership thesupport necessary for them to spend significantly more time in their stores.", "Specifically, our district managers, who typically manage eightto 10 stores each,  will now spend closeto 80% of their time in the stores helping with the execution.  By materially increasing the time our fieldleadership spends in their stores connecting with our store partners,  we believe we will have a better opportunityto share the direction of the company while developing stronger business skillsand focusing our work as a team to improve the overall store environment andexecution against our strategy.", "From this, we expect to see enhanced partner engagementwhich ties, we believe, directly to our customers\u2019 experience and therefore trafficin our stores.", "We also have a significant opportunity to attract customersto our stores through a more robust and integrated marketing strategy. We arein a very good position to tap into tools not used by Starbucks to date withthe launch of our first national television campaign highlighting our holidaypromotion.", "This is an important season for us and we\u2019ve created acompelling campaign that keeps our offerings top-of-mind with our customers,with the TV component reaching our customers out of store and in their homes.", "During the holiday season, customers look to Starbucks as abeacon of this very special celebration of community. Our integrated campaignwill increase customer awareness and engagement by highlighting those criticalfactors which differentiate us -- our connection with customers through thehighest quality coffee and hand-crafted beverages, in the third placeenvironment that exists only at Starbucks.", "We believe the overall campaign, coupled with targetedadvertising, will capitalize on our brand awareness while driving both new andexisting customers into our stores. We will focus on driving beverage sales byrecapturing the consistent quality that our customers expect from our corebeverage line-up, while delivering meaningful innovation.", "Ensuring consistent quality of every beverage we serve is absolutelycore to creating the Starbucks Experience. We are analyzing every aspect ofwhat it takes to deliver that quality by implementing initiatives such asadditional training for new baristas that specifically focuses on drinkpreparation, and by collecting feedback directly from our customers on ourperformance through an enhanced customer survey tool.", "Through this tool, customers are randomly invited throughtheir register receipt to provide feedback on their store experience, which isthen passed on to our store managers. We believe this tool will provide us withadditional insights to ensure that we are consistently delivering the StarbucksExperience.", "In the arena of meaningful innovation, we are aggressivelyfocusing our efforts on fewer, more powerful and differentiated beverageproducts. You will continue to see beverage innovation but the pace willreflect a renewed focus on relevancy to our core -- that\u2019s our coffee and thecoffee house experience.", "So turning now to our holiday promotion, which launched instores last week, we are focusing on three key areas to drive sales in ourstores -- beverages, the Starbucks Card and Starbucks Christmas Blend.", "We will be featuring the familiar holiday beverage trio ofPeppermint Mocha, Gingerbread Latte and Eggnog Latte.  We believe these much anticipated favoriteswill be sure to bring more customers into our stores during the busy shoppingseason.", "In addition to two new holiday card designs, we\u2019ve also introduceda unique card innovation called My Customized Starbucks Card for the holidayseason. For the first time, customers may purchase a voucher in our stores andthen go online to our website to personally design their own distinctiveStarbucks Card.", "This will also work great as a gift as the voucher can bepurchased in a gift box and the recipient can redeem and design theirpersonalized card online.", "While this has only been in stores for a few days, initialresponse to this new card has been very strong. Starbucks second quartertypically sees the highest level of quarterly Starbucks Card redemptions and webelieve this new twist on the card will provide yet another incentive to chooseStarbucks.", "On the merchandise side, our signature holiday whole beancoffee offering, Starbucks Christmas Blend, signifies the start of the holidayseason and it will be part of what we believe is a lineup of unique giftingitems that customers have come to love and expect from Starbucks.", "So all in all, the message I want to leave you with is that weare very focused on a number of initiatives that are dedicated to improvetraffic in the United States.", "So moving beyond the specific initiatives that I haveoutlined, we also have the opportunity to better leverage our growth across theback end of our operations. Specifically, as we have analyzed opportunities tomitigate the recent trends in the United States business, we believe we canbetter align our support and size our infrastructure to handle changes intransaction volumes as we continue our global expansion.", "Our goal is to take advantage of our enterprise scale whilefueling innovation and driving operational excellence in the stores.", "Turning now to international, we finished the year withstrong momentum.  Revenue growth was 31%for the fourth quarter, the ninth consecutive quarter with revenue growth of22% or higher, and 30% growth overall for the year.", "Also during the fourth quarter, we posted double-digitoperating margins, our second-highest in the last eight quarters. Thisimprovement demonstrates our focus and our commitment to growing revenueprofitably, expanding our operating margins steadily, and leveraging our largecore markets while expanding into newer markets for future growth.", "Pete will provide further color on the internationaloperating margin and targets for 2008 later in the call.", "By the end of the year, we had more than 4,300 storesoutside of the United States.  OurGreater China market opened 126 locations during the fiscal year, second onlyto Canada in the number of stores added in an international market during theperiod, and ended the year with more than 560 stores.", "We are in a good position leading up to the Summer Olympicsin 2008 and we continue to have a great deal of enthusiasm about theopportunities that Greater China offers.", "In addition to expanding in existing markets, we openedstores in several new markets during the year, and these included Brazil,Denmark, Egypt, Romania, The Netherlands and most recently Russia, with the openingof our first store in Moscow.", "The Russia market is especially encouraging to us, havingexperienced a very strong reception to our market entry. The average ticket atthat first store is running at the high end of any of our new market openings,which bodes very well for us as we further build out our presence in this very largemarket.", "Our efforts to expand our international footprint willcontinue into fiscal 2008 with a continued focus on extending the geographicreach of our existing joint venture business partners when and where theopportunity arises.", "Our established, successful partners provide for strongentries into new markets and provide greater efficiencies, allowing us to gainleverage by building larger regional businesses. Examples of this include ourentry into Argentina later this fiscal year with our experienced and successfulpartner in Mexico, Alsea, who is also a minority partner in our Brazilianmarket.", "You will see us similarly leverage partnerships to expandour presence in our Europe and Middle East region. A recent example is ourentry into Russia with our existing partner for the Middle East and Turkey,M.H. Alshaya.", "By entering these diverse markets, we are further laying thegroundwork for capturing the long-term international opportunity whileleveraging the scale and expertise of existing partners.", "So today, our international business spans 42 countries butit is really the maturity and scale of our developed markets -- in this case, Canadaand the U.K. -- that fuel the revenue growth, allowing the smaller countries togain experience and gradually build out scale over time.", "When we look at profit contribution, Japan\u2019s performancejoins Canada and the U.K., with the three markets providing the financialflexibility to balance our investment in expansion with profitability.", "Let me turn now to our consumer product goods business, or CPG,and the growth in both our packaged coffee and tea and our ready-to-drinkbusinesses continues as we expand into new markets and further developestablished channels.", "Market share by volume for packaged coffee in the UnitedStates continues to grow for both the Starbucks and the Seattle\u2019s Best Coffeebrands. And extending our relationship with Kraft during the year to includedistribution in Canada and the U.K. has given us further leverage in thestrength of this relationship.", "We continued to maintain our significant presence in theU.S. ready-to-drink market with an 85% market share in 2007. Our opportunitynow lies in building similarly strong customer acceptance and brand recognitionin international markets. Internationally, our ready-to-drink platform in theAsia-Pacific region reached several significant milestones during the quarter, whichinclude: selling over 100 million beverages in Japan and achieving 99%penetration in the all-important convenience store segment within that market.Also, the expansion outside North America of our PepsiCo partnership with theestablishment of a multi-country agreement.", "We were excited to launch Starbucks bottled Frappuccinoready-to-drink beverages in China on November 1, and we are in the uniqueposition of being able to leverage our brand through products like bottledFrappuccino beverages.", "Starbucks\u2019 reputation of delivering the highest qualitybeverages in our stores extends to our ready-to-drink business and allows us tointroduce new customers to the Starbucks Experience outside of our retaillocations. The introduction of bottled Frappuccino beverages in China will helpStarbucks brand awareness in this important market, attracting new customers toour existing stores while also increasing the demand for new stores.", "The expansion of ready-to-drink beverages and packagedcoffee and tea into our international markets clearly demonstrates the vastopportunity we have to extend the Starbucks Experience beyond our stores.", "So in closing, as I look ahead in my new role, I am fullyaware of both the opportunities and the challenges ahead of us. I take veryseriously the responsibility of leading our passionate, dedicated partnersaround the world to the next level of operational excellence and I can say withabsolute confidence that we are up to the task.", "We are well-positioned to execute on the initiatives we haveestablished and I look forward very much to updating you in late January on ourprogress.", "So now let me turn things back over to Jim for his finalremarks. Jim.", "James L. Donald", "I would now like to take a moment to recognize thetremendous contribution that Michael Casey has made to this organization in histwelve years as Starbucks CFO. During that period of time, our companyexperienced spectacular growth. With Michael in the critical role of ChiefFinancial Officer, we were able to aim higher and in many cases exceed ourgoals.", "His disciplined leadership and strong commitment toStarbucks\u2019 success have delivered value to our shareholders over the years andhis contribution has been recognized externally as well, as he has receivedseveral awards for his accomplishments - most recently CFO of the Year fromInstitutional Investor magazine.", "On October 1st, Michael stepped aside as CFO in preparationfor his retirement early next spring. I can\u2019t think of many CFOs of Fortune 500companies who have held their position for that length of time. This speaks tohis tenacity and commitment and his dedication to Starbucks partners.", "I would also like to thank Michael for his commitment totransitioning Pete Bocian into the CFO role. We wish Michael the best of luck.", "Before I turn the call over to Pete, let me just recap a fewthings.", "We posted solid financial results for the fourth quarter andthe fiscal year 2007, which is noteworthy given the economic environment. Whilethere are clearly challenges in our U.S. retail business, we believe there aresignificant opportunities within our control to improve our results. Today weoutlined for you some of the changes we are making to address these challengesand continue on the path towards building long-term shareholder value.", "We ended the year with momentum in our internationalbusiness that we believe will continue into fiscal 2008.

As a percentage of total net revenues,operating margin increased to 10.2% from last year\u2019s fourth-quarter margin of9.9%. The year-over-year improvement was the result of lower store operatingexpenses and general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues,coupled with price increases taken in fiscal 2007. Those factors helped offsetthe shift to higher cost products and the impact of higher dairy costs.", "Earnings per share increased to $0.21 in the fourth quartercompared to $0.17 per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2006, excludingthe $0.02 negative impact a year ago from the required accounting changerelated to asset retirement obligations.", "Non-operating factors impacting net earnings for the quarterincluded a higher effective tax rate year over year and a higher interestexpense, primarily related to an increased level of debt.", "Let me now move to fourth-quarter results for our operatingsegments. Beginning with the U.S. business, total net revenues increased by 19%to $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201807.", "Company-operated retail revenues rose 19% to $1.7 billionfor the quarter, driven by the opening of 1,065 new company-operated retailstores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 4% for thequarter.", "The growth in same-store sales was driven by a 5% increasein the average value per transaction, which resulted from the two priceincreases implemented in fiscal \u201807 and from increased food sales.", "Partially offsetting the ticket increase was a 1% decreasein transactions.", "U.S. cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percent oftotal revenues increased to 41.7% compared to 39.4% in the comparable period ayear ago.

The shift in sales mix wasprimarily due to higher sales of food and merchandise.", "U.S. store operating expenses improved 90 basis points to42.2% of related U.S. retail revenues, resulting primarily from leverage gainedwithin the business.

International totalnet revenues increased 31% to $472 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201807.Company-operated retail revenues increased 32% to $399 million in the fourthquarter of fiscal \u201807 mainly due to the opening of 277 new company-operatedretail stores in the last 12 months, favorable foreign currency exchange forthe British pound sterling and Canadian dollar, and comparable store salesgrowth of 6% for the quarter.", "The comparable store sales increase resulted from a 5%increase in the number of customer transactions, coupled with a 1% increase inthe average value per transaction, reflecting another quarter of strong growthin our international retail business.", "International operating income increased to $51 million inthe fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to $21 million in fiscal 2006. Favorableforeign exchange was not a significant contributor to the increase.

Please go ahead.", "John Glass - CIBCWorld Markets", "Thanks. A question maybe for Jim or Martin; negative trafficin the U.S. could come from a lot of different things -- cyclicality,competition, even your own over-building, and you seem to believe that a lot ofit has to do with your own execution, and I\u2019m wondering what you mean by that,what feedback or metrics you\u2019ve seen in your stores that make you believe thatthere is an opportunity there other than the usual opportunities to alwaysimprove? If you could talk a little bit about that, please.", "James L. Donald", "I think that when we look at the softness in transactions,there\u2019s a couple of things unfolding, and I mentioned them in my remarks. Thereare other operators in this specialty coffee business, but that doesn\u2019tnecessarily link in to this softness in comps. I think what you have to look atis just the pure and simple economic trends that we see.", "However, having said all that, the point that Martin wasmaking on delivering the execution, reducing the priorities of our partners tofocus in on the core of our business, which is coffee, which is taking care ofthe customer, and on the back side of this, reducing the priorities to continueto deliver on innovation by removing some of the line extension we\u2019ve done inthe past. I think that\u2019s what we are referring to in our ability to improve ourexecution.", "The three points that Martin made, whether that has to dowith a district manager starting to execute to those standards, it all playsin.", "Martin, do you have anything to add to that?", "Martin Coles", "Thanks for the question. Our focus is going to continue tobe laser-like over the course of the next year on the basics of the customerexperience, and let\u2019s be clear hear; the full customer experience comes to lifeover those individual transactions between our customers and our baristas 45million times a week. So for us, the focus is on creating great products, greatcustomized products, continuing to create great human connections, and tocontinue again to focus on the third place environment as a space of[sanctitude] and in some cases sanctuary for our customers.", "So it\u2019s all about every store, every customer, every day andfocusing on the consistency and excellence of that experience. We believe therecontinues to be significant upside there.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Glen Petraglia fromCitigroup. Please go ahead.", "Glen Petraglia -Citigroup", "Thanks. Jim or Martin, in terms of the consumer weaknessthat you highlight, we generally thought, and I think we\u2019re not alone, thatyour products are generally considered an affordable luxury. And your commentssuggest that perhaps you are even more discretionary than we thought and I washoping you might be able to help us think about that. And then, is there aparticular day part that you are seeing weakness? Is it the late afternoonwhere it\u2019s generally more snacky versus the breakfast, where it\u2019s perhaps moreroutine? Thanks.", "Martin Coles", "Thanks for the question. I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s aparticular day part that I would point to as seeing weakness. In general, Ithink our customers across the United States are experiencing a very similarphenomena, whether it\u2019s through the increase in gas prices, the overhang fromthe breakdown in the mortgage market, increasing dairy prices or cost of livingfor them in general.", "For us, the focus continues to be in making sure that wecreate the value propositions as uniquely Starbucks by making sure that wedeliver on that great-tasting and great executed beverage again in the storeenvironment they have come to expect and appreciate, most importantly throughthe great relationships that exist between our partners, not just in the UnitedStates but across the world.", "So again, it comes back to one cup at a time, onetransaction at a time and one relationship at a time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Sharon Zackfia ofWilliam Blair.

I don\u2019t know if Howard is around, but Ithink historically, he\u2019s been pretty anti- the idea of doing televisionadvertising. I\u2019m just curious about how long this has been incubating, and isthis a one-time, kind of seasonal campaign or should we expect ongoingcampaigns? And is it a reallocation of the marketing budget it or is itincremental?", "Howard Schultz", "I am here, so thank you for the question. I wouldn\u2019t readinto the advertising initiatives too much. I think it\u2019s a natural evolution ofthe maturity of the brand and the experience and the fact that we think we canget enormous leverage, given the national footprint we have in major markets asa result of the TV campaign.", "I also think that we need to recognize that the category isevolving and as the leader, we have an opportunity to make sure that our voiceis heard through the all-important medium of television. I think we are excitedabout this. I think it\u2019s the beginning of a new opportunity for us and we willreview it and look at it and measure it, and I think in the future, you\u2019llprobably see more of it but I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it.", "I do think it\u2019s the evolving nature of the equity of thebrand, and I think it\u2019s also important to note that we feel very strongly thatthe experience that we have created over a long period of time, three-plusdecades, gives us the opportunity to continue to differentiate our brand fromeveryone else that is entering this category because the experience is what hasbuilt the category, has built our company. And as we do our own research andunderstand from our most loyal customers as well as those that come lessfrequently, it\u2019s that experience that has defined the differentiation betweenus and everyone else and we will continue, as Martin and Jim have said, to makesure that we create new separation in the marketplace between ourselves andeveryone else.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Steven Kron of GoldmanSachs.", "Steven Kron - GoldmanSachs", "Thanks. Three related questions on the traffic front; first,can you just make a comment as to how the first quarter traffic is trending?Has that worsened since we exited the fourth quarter here, or what you reportin the fourth quarter?", "Second, you took down the consensus, or where consensus iscurrently at in modeling for the first quarter by a few cents and the full yearby the same, which implies to me that maybe the expectations that traffic willimprove in the second quarter and beyond. Can you comment on whether that iswhat you\u2019re baking in? And if so, what\u2019s going to drive that?", "Which leads me to the third question, which is you talkabout meaningful beverage innovation, and I was hoping to get a little bit morecolor on that. Because really, if I think about the competitors coming in andbringing products to market that are similar to what you have, theopportunities to really expand your reach to something and raise the bar a bit,I was hoping to get a little bit more as to what type of beverages and whatthings might be incubating at this point.", "Peter J. Bocian", "I\u2019ll hand the first two and then Martin will handle theinitiatives question, the innovation question.", "As Martin said, we just introduced holiday and a lot of thefirst quarter is back-end loaded towards December, so we won\u2019t know the quarteruntil we get through the next six weeks.", "Our intent in providing the EPS estimate for Q1 was to giveyou a sense of how we thought we\u2019d start with bulk dairy, and really what\u2019sbaked into that is a similar transaction environment to what we saw in the U.S.in Q4. So we think there\u2019s a couple of headwinds but we have a lot ofinitiatives around improving that balance of year.", "As I look at the EPS guidance, the $0.28 fits within the$1.02, $1.05 for the year and really I look at the $1.02, $1.05 to beconsistent with our long term goals, which we said we would build 10,000 storesin the next four years. This would be 5,000 if you add the \u201908 number. We saidwe would double the company in four to five years and we did 21% in \u201907, we\u2019relooking at 17% to 18% in \u201908. And then we\u2019ve got to focus on growing EPSthrough operating margin faster than revenue, and really that\u2019s what thisoutlook for the year reflects with EPS expected to be 17% to 21% while we growrevenue 17% to 18%.", "So still uncertainty around the economic environment, but wedo believe there is a lot in our control to drive to good improvement on ourpath towards our long-term objectives.", "Martin, on the third question.", "Martin Coles", "Thanks, Pete. Steven, thanks for the question. So up front,I want you to understand that we are as committed to innovation as we ever havebeen, and in fact, we are aggressively focusing our efforts on, as we said,more meaningful innovation, which means in my terms, at least, high impactinnovation reflecting our core.", "It also means that the pace of introductions will reflectthis new focus, so going forward you should expect fewer but more powerfulbeverage introductions focused around our core coffee house experience.", "And in specific terms, this means that from the point ofview of whether it\u2019s a latte based beverage, an espresso, a drip or a Frappuccinoin our line-up, that our innovation is focused on making sure that we give thevery best experience the customer can expect in any one of those formats on anyparticular day.", "James L. Donald", "Let me just add to that. When we examine the competitivelandscape, I think one of the things that we have not done a very good job of,because we haven\u2019t had to, is just examine and leverage the assets that thecompany has that\u2019s meaningful to our customers.", "As an example, most people that are entering the space andcreating lots of noise are not coffee roasters. They don\u2019t have 35 years ofhistory and heritage around sourcing, buying, blending, and providing thecustomer with a fully comprehended, vertically integrated experience. That\u2019s anasset that is very, very important to our customers and speaks to the quality,the loyalty, and the trust they have in Starbucks.", "We have not really had to tell that story for many, manyyears because we haven\u2019t been concerned about people trying to in any waycreate attrition for us.", "The issue of competition I just want to address, is that wetake it extremely, extremely seriously. We understand all too well that we havebuilt a very attractive business for others to look at and try and take away,whether it\u2019s 1% on the margin or big companies that are trying to take more. Weare up for the defense and we are going to get on the offense.", "I want to make it clear also that the size of the prize isso large and although I\u2019ve said it so many times, I need to say it again; wehave less than 10% share of the total coffee consumption market in NorthAmerica and less than 1% in the world. As what has happened in many consumerproducts when there is new awareness, it creates a new trial among consumerswho have not yet been in the category. That is taking place as we speak.", "Those consumers over time are going to trade up. They are goingto trade up because they are not going to be satisfied with the commoditizedexperience or the flavor. We will do everything we can to ensure the fact thatwhen they trade up, they are trading up to the company that built the categoryand is the leader and that, ladies and gentlemen, is Starbucks. And you can beassured that we are deeply, passionately committed to preserving our leadershipposition.", "Howard Schultz", "I\u2019ll also say too that this whole meaningful innovation hasbeen given more structure around the company as the head of our category sitsat my table working with my team that I mentioned earlier, and the investmentsthat we are making on this innovation front continue to grow with the business.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Joe Buckley of Bear Stearns.Please go ahead.", "Joe Buckley - BearStearns", "I want to ask a couple of questions on expansion. I don\u2019tthink the advertising campaign question was answered in terms of duration andspend. My question is really on units. Would you cut the new U.S. openings for\u201908 more aggressively if you had the flexibility to do so, if you weren\u2019tlocked into leases already? And would you anticipate opening fewer stores in2009 in the U.S.?", "Maybe as an add-on to that, can you talk about theperformance of the \u201907 openings and maybe the \u201906 openings?", "James L. Donald", "We\u2019re looking at reducing the U.S. openings by about 100stores in order to just kind of take a breather and make sure that theselocations that we looked at are the locations that we want in fiscal \u201908. Itwill also prepare us as we get ready to accelerate into \u201909 on this 10,000growth trajectory that we had out there to ensure that we hit those targets.", "We had a 2,400 store target in \u201906 and finished with -- or\u201907 and finished with 2,571, so it\u2019s hard to say that we are taking 100 out,although we are. We are still at that 10,000 store mark. So the internationalwill increase slightly as well to give us our store count for FY08.", "The question on the advertising, Joe, we\u2019re not going to talkabout the cost of doing this. It\u2019s part of our holiday campaign, but as Howardsaid, this is just a start for us to reach a broader audience and in this case,reach out with some of our holiday offerings to customers that quite franklycontinued to grow and we haven\u2019t reached quite yet. So this is a campaign thatwe are putting in place now for the holiday season.", "Howard Schultz", "The answer to your question about if these leases were notsigned, would we go, and the answer is unequivocally yes.  We believe in the size of the market. Wedon\u2019t believe that the issue around saturation is something that we see. In thelong-term, we think our company and most importantly our shareholders will berewarded for the growth and the footprint that we are creating.", "James L. Donald", "Martin, did you want to say one more thing to Joe on the --", "Martin Coles", "Joe, let me just add to your question on advertising, tomake sure that we are being very clear in our answers to you, which is the TVadvertising campaign is really a small part of a much larger, integratedcampaign that you would normally expect from us around a major holiday periodsuch as Christmas time.", "So the components comprise in-store, outer house, there\u2019sproduct and transaction, a significant product and transaction focus to thecampaign itself, and it\u2019s very much an invitation to visit Starbucks during theholidays. And at the same time, going back to my commentary early on about thefocus on the basics, it\u2019s also been incumbent on all of us as operators to makesure that we are showing up in our very best way for our customers when theyarrive.", "But I think it\u2019s important to understand that this is anintegrated piece of a much larger campaign.

Bocian", "Joe, I think you had a last question around store metrics. Acouple of things; first of all, we\u2019re going to drive and set targets out therefor the businesses and you saw that today in terms of the op margin expansionand what we expect in the total company, in U.S. and international. And then wealso look at things like ROIC and return on equity for the company in total, andthose are all trending positively.", "Sub-metrics to that, if you look at the total store metrics,we stayed relatively flat at about 1,000,050 per store in the U.S. for the compstores. If you look at the new stores and you take the class of \u201906, which isdone by now, we had about 870K for the first year on average for the \u201906 class,and that represented about a 2.0-to-1 revenue-to-investment ratio.", "If you look at the \u201907 class, it\u2019s still not done and Iwould say as we look at it, if you trend it out, it\u2019s a little -- it\u2019s slightlybelow the \u201906 class. But when we look at it, it\u2019s really we believe the resultof the same economic factors we talked about through the call. There\u2019s justmore months sitting in the \u201907 class than there were in the \u201906 class in termsof the economic pressure.", "Howard Schultz", "I would say that despite the downturn in comps, when youlook at the return on investment and the unit economics that we continue to putup year after year after year, they are best of class.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Andrew Barish of Banc of AmericaSecurities. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Barish - Bancof America Securities", "I was wondering on the G&A number, you guys have done agood job on basically keeping that flat on a dollar basis for two years now. Itsounds like there are some efforts, obviously with the advertising and kind ofreinvesting in some things that may drive that higher, but then I think Martinalso mentioned some efficiencies. Can you just give us a sense on a dollarbasis, is this a new run-rate or do you expect that to kick up a little bit in2008?", "James L. Donald", "I think the way I would look at it is separate the front-endfrom back-end, so when we talk about support expenses, I don\u2019t put theadvertising or the revenue generating investments in that space.", "But I think over time, we\u2019ve grown so fast that we\u2019ve builda back-end or a support structure that has an opportunity to be better alignedwith the business going forward, take advantage of global scale, and we can dothat and leverage 17% to 18% growth, for example, in 2008.", "That will give us room in the model for op margin expansioneven if transactions move around a little bit, so that\u2019s what we were trying tosay, both in Martin and my comments.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein ofLehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Bernstein -Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. Actually, two follow-up questions; first, I thinkyou had mentioned in your prepared remarks that fiscal \u201907 U.S. traffic came inbelow plan and decelerated through the year. I know you said first quarterfiscal \u201908 is probably running a similar level as to how it ended in \u201907. Butit does seem like you have targets, so I\u2019m just wondering what you arecurrently targeting in terms of traffic from all of fiscal \u201908 in terms of theback three quarters.", "And then second, just on the U.S. unit growth topic andcannibalization, I think you\u2019ve noted in the past some pockets of likelycannibalization across the U.S. but not the driver to further slowing your unitgrowth. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about the magnitude of potentialcannibalization.", "And perhaps to play the role of devil\u2019s advocate, what mightbe the pros and cons to slowing the unit growth in the U.S. even further andperhaps accelerating international, where I know you\u2019ve highlighted tremendoussuccess, at least until the traffic trends reaccelerate? Thanks.", "Peter J. Bocian", "Let me do the traffic question about \u201908. We gave you compsfor global of 3% to 5%. Typically, and we expect the same thing in \u201908, thatinternational is growing faster than U.S., so the U.S. numbers will be slightlybelow that.", "We had the October \u201906 price increase drop off in the year.We still have about 10 months of the July 31st that will be baked in, so thereis -- the U.S. is slightly below the 3% to 5%. There is a ticket componentrelative to the price as well as food that we expect, but we definitely need tohave -- we expect to have transaction positive for the year embedded in the rangewe gave you for the U.S.", "James L. Donald", "On the store count, we had reduced the U.S. slightly thisyear, but when we look at this traffic softening, we\u2019re looking at it from aneconomic environment as we see it all across the retail industry. And our perspective,the saturation comments are overblown. Our perspective hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019restill opening new stores knowing that the surrounding stores will experiencesome level of pressure but also the understanding of the convenience that willdrive the customer frequency.", "And we\u2019ve said once, we\u2019ve said quite a few times that wejust need to be where the customer is, so again we\u2019re balancing that and thislittle pause in \u201908 will give us a chance to recalibrate, look at this, andcontinue to grow towards the 10,000 stores. Howard.", "Howard Schultz", "I think your other question that you asked was aboutinternational, and we just came off of a three-day meeting in Seattle of ourglobal partners. We all felt really positive after that meeting, given thehealth, the strength, and the conviction that we and our partners have. And youcan sense also one partner after another wanting more geography as a result ofthe success they are having in their home market, whether it\u2019s Mexico, whetherit\u2019s our Middle East partner that took on Russia, our Spanish partner who wantsPortugal and on and on and on.", "So we clearly see the runway for international, the leveragethat we hope to gain, and the momentum that we think is on our back.", "One thing about this call that we just touched on is China.I just came back from a week in China and I can only tell you that we arewinning there, and not only in terms of unit economics but most importantly theattachment, the emotional attachment that the Chinese consumer has to the Starbucksexperience. And what we have done there since 1999 perhaps is unparalleledcompared to any other Western retailer.", "So we know all full well what the opportunity is but we haveto be very careful and measured so that we expand the international business asthoughtful as possible. But the size of that prize is enormous.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Larry Miller of RBCCapital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.", "Larry Miller - RBCCapital Markets", "Thanks. Good evening, guys. You know, I\u2019m just looking atthe guidance and Pete, maybe you can give me a hand here. I can imagine whereinvestors are looking at Q1 and it\u2019s only 6% to 7% growth and thinking thatlooks pretty conservative. But that also implies a very substantial earningsacceleration from Q2 to Q4, and that\u2019s probably a bit hard to swallow, givenwhat you are saying about some traffic trends and some pressures on dairy.", "I\u2019m just hoping that maybe you can give me a couple ofspecific leverage points as you look at the second half. And maybe related tothat, is it you guys staffed up for a lot of growth for \u201907 and now there\u2019sgoing to be a little bit less, maybe a little bit less going forward and youmight save a little bit there, or is it just as simple as dairy eases in yourplan in the second half? Or am I missing something?", "Peter J. Bocian", "Well, the first point is that we expect a $0.02 dairy hitfor the year, and there\u2019s $0.02 in the first quarter. And by the way, we\u2019redealing with numbers that you round -- one penny rounds a significant amount,but look at it as the whole dairy impact is actually in Q1 and we\u2019re not theexperts, but the experts are saying it will ease and we\u2019ll actually have a goodguy in dairy in Q4, which will be dramatically different than what we justreported in Q4.", "The last significant transaction comps in the U.S., 3%, werein Q1 of \u201907. So we\u2019ve got the highest hurdle as well relative from acomparison standpoint, and those are the two big drivers, that we\u2019recommunicating that the first quarter is going to not have the average let\u2019scall it EPS expansion that we expect for the year, but we also, when you couplethe compare with the initiatives we\u2019ve talked about today, that\u2019s where we getto the $1.02, $1.05 for the year.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of theallotted time for questions and answers today. Ms. DeGrande, are there anyclosing remarks?", "JoAnnDeGrande", "Thank you, Mark. That concludes Starbucks' fourth quarterand fiscal year-end 2007 earnings call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2008 financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions) Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations at Starbucks Coffee Company. With me today are Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; Pete Bocian, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Martin Coles, Chief Operating Officer. ", "Today\u2019s call is scheduled for one hour, including Q&A.", "As a reminder to all listeners, this call is being broadcast live over the Internet. A replay will be available via telephone at 800-642-1687, reservation number 22248459 through 5:30 p.m. Pacific Time on Wednesday, February 6, 2008, and on the investor relations page at starbucks.com through 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Friday, February 29, 2008.", "In addition, today\u2019s remarks will be available on the investor relations portion of starbucks.com by the end of the day today and will remain available through February 29, 2008.", "This conference call includes forward-looking statements about company plans and initiatives, including its transformation agenda, and trends in or expectations regarding earnings per share growth, net new store openings, the performance of the U.S. economy, comparable store sales growth, shareholder value, recruiting new executives, capital expenditures, guidance and targets, and capital structure. ", "These forward-looking statements are all based on currently available operating, financial, and competitive information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties.", "Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the risk factors section of Starbucks' annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2006.", "The company assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.", "With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Howard Schultz.", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I hope you had an opportunity to read the release we issued within the past hour. ", "During today\u2019s call, I will give an overview of some of the progress we\u2019ve made over the past several weeks to lay the foundation for the transformation of Starbucks, as well as our first quarter results. Pete will then take you through the financials in greater detail, and after that we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you may have. ", "First, I want to say how confident I am in what\u2019s ahead for Starbucks. Over the past three weeks, I have received thousands of emails from customers and partners who share my enthusiasm. Our brand and business are truly special. People want us to succeed and we are looking forward to transforming Starbucks for the future. ", "The past several weeks have also been notable for the noise about competition in the coffee space. Let me emphasize: we don\u2019t see that as the issue. What we have to do is simple: Differentiate our experience, so that when a customer walks into a Starbucks store, they get something that they can only get from us: the highest quality coffee in the world served by the most passionate and knowledgeable people in the industry. We created the experience and we will re-create that differentiation and leadership position. We strongly believe that we control our own destiny. ", "And when we do that, we grow our business. We are a growth company. Our past success was built on us striving to do better and be better, on connecting with customers and innovating, and on embracing change, not fearing it. So our future growth at the levels that you and we expect from Starbucks will also be based on those same qualities. Returning to the sort of growth we want to achieve requires us to sharpen our competitive advantages: our passion, curiosity, community, commitment and authenticity. That\u2019s how we build our deep and enduring connection with our customers. ", "As important, today we have an excellent platform on which to build. After all, this quarter our results included: operating income of $333 million; net cash from operating activities of $808 million; and solid international performance, with revenue growth of 33% and enhanced profitability of over 60% for the quarter. ", "But at the same time, our Q1 performance clearly shows we have work to do to get the business back to where it should be. We are absolutely not satisfied with our overall performance during this period, which Pete will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. ", "What do we have to do? Transform the way we do business.  As I described earlier in the month, we need to improve the current state of the U.S. business, reignite the emotional attachment with our people and our customers, and make fundamental changes for the long-term. ", "In all of these areas going forward, we are going to make decisions based on what\u2019s right for our customers. We are laser focused on delivering what they want and expect and providing our partners with the tools that will help them exceed their expectations. ", "In doing that with passion, creativity and commitment, we expect to deliver increased growth and shareholder value in a way that is sustainable and in-line with what you and we expect. ", "It has only been three weeks since the change in leadership, but we have made significant progress. ", "We now have put in place the organizational structure and the leadership team directly aligned to focus on customers and partners engaged in delivering on our high-impact strategies.  ", "Martin Coles is now focusing with me on developing and effectively executing our strategy. And we expect to get additional leverage across the organization with Michelle Gass, who most recently led our global product and brand group, in the new role of Senior Vice President Global Strategy. She will work closely with Martin and me to help implement all aspects of our transformation plan. ", "We promoted Terry Davenport to lead our marketing and brand strategy group. We have also hired Harry Roberts, a former Starbucks executive, to assume the newly created role of chief creative officer and be responsible for elevating the customer in-store experience. ", "We have moved Chris Bruzzo, a current partner, into the newly created position of chief technology officer, a position he earned for the exceptional work he has done since joining us from Amazon a year ago. ", "With a keen focus on our people, we have promoted Chet Kuchinad, an experienced partner, to lead Partner Resources, our HR function.  ", "In addition, we are in the process of recruiting senior executives for our newly established Global Real Estate Design and Architecture group, as well as a new chief information officer, and a leader for our Public Affairs function.  ", "With this team, we are now positioned to free up Launi Skinner, president of our U.S. business and Jim Alling, president of International, to do what they do best: operate their businesses.  ", "Working together, we will return to what has always set us apart, the unique Starbucks Experience \u2013 connecting with our customers by delivering the highest quality coffee and hand-crafted beverages in a warm and inviting store environment. ", "We have now assigned accountabilities to all our leadership team and their direct reports.  They will own everything about their business and have responsibility for specific projects to drive the transformation agenda forward. ", "We have also validated a number of programs that were already in the pipeline or underway that will support and further the vision. And for all of these, we have set timeframes for deliverables, with some coming in the very near future, especially in the U.S. business. ", "And please make no mistake -- we will transform the business while strengthening our relationship with our customers and building on our premium and leadership position.   ", "The first of these actions, as we told you earlier this month, is to slow the pace of U.S. store openings. We now plan to open a total of approximately 1,175 net new stores in the U.S. this year, down 34% from our fiscal 2007 openings. That includes closing approximately 100 underperforming stores. In addition, for 2009 we plan to open fewer than 1,000 new stores in the U.S.   ", "By reducing the number of openings, we expect to optimize our resources and potentially reduce cannibalization of existing stores. We have also taken decisive action in other areas to enhance the Starbucks Experience.  Let me give you a prime example.", "We have decided that by the end of fiscal 2008, we will discontinue warmed breakfast sandwiches in our North American stores. The highest priority for our food team is to develop the right offerings so that we are the source of healthy breakfast on the go, and also provide the best-in-class baked goods in the business to complement our superior coffee and espresso beverages. Our customers have told us they want a healthy breakfast alternative. No one in the market has responded to that need, and we believe that by being innovative we have a unique opportunity to do so. ", "Some of you may be asking why we made this decision -- in short, the scent of the warmed sandwiches interferes with the coffee aroma in our stores, which is key to the coffee experience that forges our connection with customers.  Moreover, while our customers liked our sandwiches, they told us they missed the aroma and the romance of coffee. We will continue warming pastries and selling lunch, with some modifications to the lineup. ", "We recognize that there could be a short-term revenue impact to this decision, but it is the right decision for the business. If we execute flawlessly on our core, which we are committed to, our coffee, then we will drive customer engagement and longer-term top and bottom line growth. ", "That is just one example of some of the changes you will see in the coming months that will substantially change the retail experience in the U.S.  At our Annual Meeting of our shareholders on March 19th, we will lay out five specific, bold consumer-facing initiatives that will be a major catalyst for change and transformation. They will be innovations through which we will extend our coffee leadership, reinvest in making our stores the third place for the next decade, encourage a deeper dialogue with our customers, and further strengthen our partners\u2019 and customers\u2019 relationships with one another. And that is just the beginning.  ", "These actions will reaffirm for customers and the marketplace that unlike others, we are not a reseller of commodity-based coffee roasted by a third party. We never have been  and never will be. We will utilize all of our 35-plus years of ethically sourcing, buying and roasting the finest coffee in the world to reaffirm our coffee authority. ", "We are confident through our actions that we will get back on track in redefining the customer experience and expanding the differentiation in the market between us and the others in the coffee business.   ", "At the same time we have devoted considerable attention to the U.S. strategy, we are capitalizing on our substantial international opportunities. ", "This fiscal year, we will open approximately an additional 75 net new stores in international markets, increasing the international store opening target for the year to about 975 net new stores. In fiscal 2009, that number will rise to over 1,000 new stores internationally, and it will mark the first time that our international store openings will outpace those in the U.S. As we continue to build our business around the world, we are encouraged by the strong ongoing customer response in existing markets and the tremendous reception our brand receives in new markets, such as the Czech Republic. ", "We opened our first store in Prague this month to near-record crowds and sales, and given the centuries-long caf\u00e9 tradition there, it\u2019s a market that we view as a great opportunity to compete and succeed. Further, the strong initial response is a great sign for our expansion in Central and Eastern Europe. We plan for Poland and Hungary to be the next markets there.  ", "I want to emphasize that the capital we are putting toward our international business is focused on profitable growth. We will also leverage what we learn in different markets around the world to share best practices in all of our stores, hopefully benefiting the U.S. situation. ", "We are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead not only in the U.S. and international businesses, but also in our Consumer Products Group. As you will hear from Pete, our CPG business had a solid quarter and we view it as an important growth driver for our brand and our performance. ", "We are also mindful that as we take these actions to deliver improved top-line performance in the future, we also intend to realize opportunities to leverage back-end costs.   ", "Given all of the work underway, we view fiscal 2008 as a year of refocus and renewal. But there are no quick-fix solutions. It will take time. We are confident our transformational changes will position us well for the long-term. ", "Consequently, there will be moving pieces in the coming months that include funding for our innovations, and we also expect there will be continued weakness in the macro-economic environment that affects our customers.   ", "For these reasons, during this critical period of transition and transformation, we believe that you should expect low double-digit EPS expansion for the fiscal year.   ", "By the end of the fiscal year, however, we anticipate that Starbucks will have gone through the transition, be reinvigorated, and our customers will have a new experience in our stores. And in fiscal 2009, we will be well on the path of providing sustainable growth and long-term value for our shareholders. ", "Accordingly, we believe that you and we need ways to measure our progress as we build and then leverage our strong foundation to capture those long-term growth opportunities.   ", "Therefore, we are committed to coming back to you quickly in April when we announce our second quarter results with quantifiable, longer-term metrics.  Pete will discuss what we are planning in some detail in a few minutes. And with those longer-term metrics in place, we are discontinuing annual guidance for fiscal 2009 and beyond. ", "In addition, a number of our near-term changes will directly impact the retail stores. Therefore, we will not report same store sales comps, as they will not be an effective indicator of our performance. Once our U.S. performance normalizes following our actions, we will evaluate the value of reporting quarterly same store sales comps. ", "We believe these actions are the right thing for our company and our investors. They will assist our people and our management team in making the right business decisions to focus on the customer and in running the business to create long-term growth and long-term value for shareholders. ", "Before I hand the call over to Pete, let me just make a comment on one particular subject that\u2019s gotten a lot of attention in the last few weeks, the $1 brewed coffee, eight-ounce short cup test. With a brand like ours and stores all over the world, we conduct dozens of tests a year and it\u2019s inevitable that people will get interested in a test like this. We are running it in a limited number of stores in the Seattle area to respond to the economic pressures that our customers are under. ", "Right now, as a test, it makes sense to us. Starbucks is built on premium coffee and a premium experience and similar to other leading global consumer brands, we believe there are opportunities to create segmentation, provide an entry point for new customers, and generate trial in a way that will also maintain the value of our core brand proposition. ", "We intend to reaffirm our position as the coffee authority and maintain our leadership position at the high end while broadening our appeal. I would like to emphasize this offering is just a test. We will be listening intently to our customer feedback as well as evaluating whether such a product advances our business objectives and creates value while maintaining our super premium leadership position.  ", "Now let me invite Pete to take you through the quarter. Pete. ", "Peter J. Bocian", "Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenues for the quarter were up 17% to $2.8 billion, from $2.4 billion a year ago.  ", "Operating income for the quarter increased to $333 million from $320 million in the prior year. Operating margins contracted 160 basis points to 12% from last year\u2019s first-quarter margin of 13.6%, driven by the U.S. business.  In the quarter, both international and CPG operating margins improved and favorable corporate G&A contributed positively as well. The decline in the consolidated margins was the result of higher cost of sales and occupancy, and an increase in store operating expenses, again driven by the U.S. business.  I will provide more detail behind these drivers when I talk about the U.S. results.", "Earnings per share increased to $0.28 cents in the first quarter of this fiscal year, in line with our expectations, and compared to $0.26 cents per share in Q1 of \u201807. As expected, higher dairy costs resulted in a negative $0.02 impact to EPS in the quarter.  That said, while the $0.28 cents was what we expected overall entering the quarter, results from international, our Consumer Products Group and back-end G&A exceeded our expectations, offsetting a much softer U.S. business. ", "Non-operating factors impacting net earnings for the quarter included higher interest expense driven by an increased level of debt when compared to the first quarter of 2007.  The debt was used to repurchase shares, resulting in a net neutral impact on earnings per share in the quarter. We also had a slightly better effective tax rate year over year. ", "Comparable store sales growth was 1% for the quarter, all driven by the International business. I will talk more specifically about the business results later in my segment discussions, but it\u2019s clear that our U.S. business continues to feel the negative impact of the macroeconomic environment, not dissimilar to what other retail brands are seeing.  A bright spot in the quarter was International same store sales growth, where we continued to show strength with a 5% increase year over year.   ", "Let me now move to first-quarter results for our operating segments.   ", "U.S. total net revenues increased by 14% to $2.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal \u201808. Company-operated retail revenues rose 14% to $1.9 billion for the quarter, driven by the opening of 1,077 new company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months.  Comparable store sales declined 1% in the quarter, driven by a 3% decrease in transactions.  We did have a 2% increase in the average value per transaction, mostly due to the price increase taken at the end of July 2007. And while it had a positive impact on the average value per transaction, we believe pricing had the opposite affect on transactions. ", "While this performance was below our plan and expectation entering the quarter, we believe it is consistent with and reflects the pressure the consumer is experiencing in this difficult economic climate. For us, this has resulted in decreased frequency of visits by our customers to our U.S. stores.  ", "While we cannot directly impact the economic environment, we do believe that slowing the opening of new stores in the U.S., along with the closure of underperforming locations, will take some of the pressure off of existing stores, allowing us to make better decisions around how we deploy our capital.  ", "U.S. cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues increased to 41.1%, compared to 39.3% in Q1 of last year, up 180 basis points.  While this is a slight improvement from how we finished 2007, continued pressure from dairy, and to a lesser extent, the shift in sales mix to higher cost products combined with overall lower store transactions, continues to drive year over year increases. ", "U.S. store operating expenses increased to 40.5% of related U.S. retail revenues compared with 39.1% a year ago. This increase was primarily due to wage increases driving higher payroll-related expenditures as a percentage of revenue and softer sales from our U.S. company-operated stores. ", "U.S. other operating expenses improved 120 basis points to 25% of related specialty revenues from 26.2% in the prior year, primarily due to leverage gained from a growing revenue base in our U.S. Licensed stores and Foodservice channels. ", "U.S. operating income declined to $311 million during the quarter from $325 million in Q1 of fiscal \u201807. Operating margins came in at 14.6% of total revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2008, from 17.5% a year ago, primarily driven by higher cost of sales including occupancy and higher store operating expenses, partially offset by lower G&A as a percentage of total net revenues. ", "Currently, the U.S. business represents a significant amount of the Company\u2019s revenues and profit so softness in the U.S. business has a material impact on overall results.   ", "That said, we are encouraged by the improvement in performance of our International business in the quarter, and we continue to believe this represents a significant opportunity for growth and profitability for the company going forward.   ", "International total net revenues increased 33% to $541 million in the first quarter from $405 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.  Company-operated retail revenues increased 33% to $461 million, mainly due to the opening of 285 new company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, favorable foreign exchange movement in  the Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling, and comparable store sales growth of 5% for the quarter.  ", "The comparable store sales increase resulted from a 3% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction.  We believe the growth in international revenues continues to demonstrate the strong acceptance of our brand and the Starbucks experience globally.   ", "International operating income increased 63% to $54 million in the first quarter compared to $33 million a year ago. In the quarter, we delivered the first installment on our commitment to grow and improve operating margins, with a 180 basis point expansion, from 8.2% of revenues in the first quarter of last year, to 10% of revenues in this fiscal year\u2019s first quarter. This improvement was due to lower occupancy costs year over year in the UK and lower store operating expenses overall. ", "We are pleased with our Q1 operating margin expansion and will continue to drive for margin improvements going forward. ", "Now let me turn to results from our Global Consumer Products Group. ", "Total net revenues for CPG increased 11% to $101 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Increased product sales and royalties from the International ready-to-drink business along with increased sales of packaged coffee and tea in our International and U.S. markets contributed to the increase. ", "Operating income for CPG was $51 million in Q1 of \u201908, compared to $42 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The operating margin expanded to 50.3% of related revenues, from the 45.9% reported in Q1 of fiscal \u201807, primarily driven by a decrease in the cost of sales expense as a percent of revenues. ", "Before I move on to a few comments related to our balance sheet, I want to note the 50 basis point improvement in G&A expenses as a percentage of total net revenues.  This demonstrates progress we are making in leveraging our scale and infrastructure, while at the same time, we are also implementing systematic changes, which we expect will better position the company\u2019s back-end infrastructure to deliver more efficient service and support to our retail network.   ", "As previously reported, the company issued $550 million of 6.25% 10-year notes in Q4 of \u201907, a component of our strategy to reduce the overall weighted average cost of capital for the company. Proceeds from this offering were primarily used to repay short term borrowings and fund additional share repurchases. ", "Our longer term outlook on the company\u2019s capital structure is unchanged: any additional funding would be consistent with management\u2019s strategy of targeting leverage and coverage ratios to be roughly in line with a high Triple B rating over the medium-term, which is where we are today. ", "During the first quarter, the company repurchased 12.2 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $295 million. After the first-quarter share repurchase, there were only 1.3 million shares of remaining authorization. As you saw today in our press release, we announced a new share repurchase authorization by our Board of Directors for up to an additional 5 million shares of our common stock. Going forward, we will make use of this authorization, in line with the parameters mentioned earlier. ", "To summarize the quarter, there were a number of positives: we achieved revenue and EPS expansion in line with our expectations, in spite of a more negative U.S. economic environment. ", "We delivered notable improvement in the International margin and will continue to drive for improvements going forward.", "CPG and G&A leverage also provided positive contributions to overall results.  We will continue to focus on opportunities to leverage our scale and infrastructure, and we are encouraged by the energy and attention we are already seeing around a global platform approach. ", "On the other hand, the continued weakness in the U.S. business was disappointing, although not entirely unexpected given continued deterioration in this challenging economic and operating environment. And as anticipated, higher dairy costs had a significant negative impact on our U.S. margins. ", "So what are we doing to turn the U.S. business around? ", "To begin with, earlier this month we committed to further slowing U.S. store growth, including more aggressively closing underperforming locations. We have made substantial progress over the past few weeks. As Howard mentioned earlier, we have identified approximately 100 underperforming U.S. company-operated retail stores.  ", "These anticipated closures for our U.S. company-operated stores followed an in-depth analysis of our portfolio, and is nearly 6 times our prior 3-year average for store closures. These actions, coupled with a reduction in new store openings, brings us to our fiscal 2008 U.S. company-operated store openings target of approximately 650 net new company-operated stores and 525 licensed stores.    ", "In our international business, we will open about 75 additional net new stores this fiscal year, moving faster on the growth opportunity in international where we are still in the early stages.   ", "Looking out to fiscal 2009, we plan to open more than 1,000 net new stores in international markets and less than 1,000 new locations in the U.S., with approximately half of those to be company-operated stores. This marks a significant crossover point in our growth strategy as we plan to build out more new stores in international markets than in the U.S. beginning in fiscal 2009.  It also signals progress toward increasing the future contribution from our international business to the overall enterprise. ", "In a year of significant transformation for us and a very difficult macroeconomic environment, we are looking to deliver low double-digit earnings growth -- lower than expected but a year that we believe balances the need for transformation and investment, with delivering near-term results.   ", "When we come back in late April with our Q2 results, we will be prepared then to deliver to you our 3year view through 2011.  At that time, we will provide you with our 2011 targets for revenue, from a total company view, as well as for our three business segments: U.S., International and CPG; operating income for the company and for each segment; earnings per share; and capital deployed and Free cash flow. We will also provide you with some color as to how the performance during that three-year period will sequence. And we do expect to make progress and start delivering in 2009. ", "With that, I will turn the call back over to Howard for his closing remarks.", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, Pete. Before I open the call up to your questions, I want to share one other encouraging result with you -- one that cannot be quantified and that many of you may discount but one that I believe is emblematic of the success that lies ahead for our company. ", "Our connection with our customers begins with our partners who are so closely reflective of those we serve. We do not need to rely heavily on focus groups to develop new ideas; our relevance with our customers comes from the fact that we are among them, part of the same communities and part of their lives. That is why I am so excited by the overwhelmingly positive internal response and engagement by our partners. Their focus and commitment will help us realize our objectives with our customers, and our goals for creating long-term growth and shareholder value.   ", "This is a sentiment that is echoed in Fortune Magazine\u2019s recently released \u201c100 Best Companies to Work\u201d where we ranked number 7. This is our debut in the top 10, and the highest ranking we have received in the 10 times that we have been included in the list.   ", "Having a strong group of dedicated partners at all levels of the company provides a critical boost to our efforts. We believe passionately that when we invest in our people, build an emotional connection with them and get them fully engaged with our strategy and agenda, we see the positive results in our performance. ", "To help us achieve that, we are bringing back our annual Leadership Conference in the Fall of 2008. This is the most important and strategic event that we hold for store managers and above and it is a major internal signal that the transformation is not only occurring for customers, but for our people as well. Not only does it help us generate understanding and enthusiasm about our vision and strategy throughout our organization, but it ensures that we maintain the links between our field and corporate leadership. This year, we will also augment it with a series of open forums for all of our partners around the world. ", "Everyone here at Starbucks knows that we have a lot of work ahead of us.  Rest assured though, planning and in fact execution are well underway. We have shared with you a summary of what we have accomplished already in these past three weeks. ", "In about six weeks from now, we look forward to showing you our innovative platforms which will begin to re-invent the customer experience. And then, six weeks from that time on April 30th, we will frame out in detail our strategic and financial plans. At that time we will also give you a date for later in the year when we intend to host an Analyst Conference to tell you more about where we are and what we have on tap, as well as introduce you to some of the leadership team who are so critical in making all this happen.  ", "We are all very excited about the future for Starbucks and confident the actions we are taking will deliver long-term shareholder value and maintain our position as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. ", "Now I\u2019d be happy to open up the questions. Operator. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Steven Kron of Goldman Sachs. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "A question on the guidance -- I\u2019m just trying to reconcile what you guys are factoring in for the year. For the first quarter, it seems as though EPS grew around 6% to 7%. You are targeting low double-digits, so presumably you need to do something low to mid double-digits in the remaining part of the year, but it seems as though top line, the growth rate at least is going to slow from slower development, from less units and also eliminating the warm breakfast sandwiches, which I believe was around a 3% lift to comps in the past. ", "So if I trickle down the P&L, are we expecting some meaningful margin expansion to come through and kind of act as a big of an offset?", "Peter J. Bocian", "Steve, if you look at Q1, the 8% EPS expansion had the biggest dairy hit we expect, so there were $0.02 of EPS impact negative that we expect latter part of the year will trail down and then switch over in Q4. That\u2019s what the experts are saying, so look at Q1 as the biggest dairy hit for the year. But we do need to improve from what we showed up, right, to get to the low double-digit EPS growth. ", "What we factored in is our view of a tougher U.S. economic environment but with the innovation that Howard will talk about on March 19th and the impact, we believe it will happen for fiscal \u201908. ", "We have also factored in the performance, the good start for international and CPG and our ability to near-term impact the cost structure. We\u2019ve also factored in the other announcements that we talked about today, whether it\u2019s the de-emphasizing the warm breakfast sandwiches and getting to a new breakfast offering, or the store openings being less in the U.S. this year. ", "So we factored all that into what we believe is the right guidance which, as I said before, balances a huge transformation year for us with still delivering good EPS expansion. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray.", "Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray", "Good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could first help define or quantify underperforming stores? And then second, what G&A leverage is assumed for this year in guidance? It sounds like you are talking about the percentage going down. Can the actual dollar amount go down as well? Thank you. ", "Peter J. Bocian", "We\u2019ve taken a multi-year view at the -- let\u2019s call it the returns on a store and whether they can meet the business case or an acceptable return over the medium to long-term as we made these decisions, so we are looking at stores with that context. ", "The second question, I\u2019m sorry?", "Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray", "It was what have you factored in G&A leverage to the -- ", "Peter J. Bocian", "I think what\u2019s factored into it, as I just explained, was that we have G&A leverage expected for the year. I think we will wait until April when we talk about the bigger cost take out opportunity going out from \u201909 to 2011 to kind of quantify it. So you should look for baked into the guidance I gave you are the number of components I defined for Steven. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Joe Buckley of Bear Stearns. ", "Joseph Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Thank you. Just going back to the last question, can we get just a little bit more detail on the decision making process, not only on the store closures but on sort of what the right number of openings are on the licensed and the company side? And what do you expect for total CapEx now in \u201908, and if you can share it for \u201909?", "Peter J. Bocian", "As I said, the decisions, medium to longer term around the viability of the stores, we believe having less openings at this point in time in addition to the economic environment gives us an opportunity to have less cannibalization and better use of capital. And then, you should expect from this discrete decision somewhat less capital than the previous $1.1 billion I talked about. ", "That said, there may be use of capital in the innovation that we will define on March 19th. So some benefit from in-year less store count and that will certainly continue into \u201909 in terms of the capital required for new stores. But there will probably also be an innovation price tag this year. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of David Palmer with UBS. ", "David Palmer - UBS ", "From 2005 to 2007, you almost doubled the pace of new opens and you\u2019ve had some pretty ineffective innovation, and of course you\u2019ve had the economic environment and the breakfast sandwiches. Arguably, there have been some things you are going to be reversing here. I\u2019m wondering, how are you thinking about the positives and negatives of slowing down the unit growth? And in particular, how much is this going to help your AUVs, if you want to choose that?", "But importantly, I really would love to know why you think it would help your stock, the company, investors, or anybody to remove disclosure at a time like this. ", "Howard Schultz", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at it quite that way. If you look at the comp issue first, we are going to be taking out breakfast sandwiches as well as we are engaged in a comprehensive audit of every category and every SKU that we are engaged in on a daily basis with our customers and every product and every category has to pass the test on its own merit by adding value profitably and really providing the experience with the customers that we want. ", "In view of this new lens of discipline and customer-centric focus, we need to make decisions that are not based on driving comps in the short-term. Comps are going to be very erratic and in view of that, we think there are better ways to measure the ongoing short and long term success of the company. ", "We\u2019re going to provide you, as Pete has outlined, on April 30th with new metrics that we feel really I think for the first time give us an opportunity not only to provide you insight about our retail business but the growing segments of the business. For example, we have hundreds and hundreds of stores that don\u2019t -- that are not in the comp base because of the license arrangements or JVs. ", "We have millions of dollars that we can\u2019t report to you because we don\u2019t get the credit for businesses like bottled Frappuccino. The total sales of Starbucks are much, much greater than the $9.4 billion that we recorded in \u201907. ", "So what we want to do is not take anything away but provide you with a broader level of insight and clarity about the overall business and as Pete said, the ongoing trajectory of international. ", "And the last piece is this -- the decisions that we\u2019ve made in the past, good or bad or indifferent, in many ways have been tied to the relationship that our managers and the leaders of the company have had to driving comps. And it hasn\u2019t always been the right decision most importantly for the customer. ", "And what we want to do once and for all is put the customer in the middle of every meeting that we are in and make decisions that are based on what is best for the customer experience. And we know that in the past and in the future, if we drive a mentality of exceeding the expectations of the customers on what is best for them, we will drive long-term value for the shareholder. And we need to transform the culture and the internal way we are making decisions as well as the customer experience. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird", "Howard, you mentioned that you were building a foundation to return to the growth that the investment community and you might expect. I know you are going to be giving more details in the coming months but could you give us a directional sense for what type of growth rate you might expect as you look out beyond \u201909? Is it something that you would expect to accelerate in the future or how are you thinking about that?", "Howard Schultz", "I think it\u2019s a fair question. I think we\u2019ll have to hold that until the 30th of April but I do want to state in the answer, as I did in the text, that we are committed to being a growth company, that we are built for growth. We think we have opportunities that we have not taken advantage of and that the entire culture and mentality of this company is linked to being a growth company. ", "And that is not something that we are going to give up. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Glen Petraglia of Citigroup. ", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "I guess the big question that I have is you are shifting to accelerating international growth where margins and presumably the returns on the investment that you are making there are lower than they\u2019ve been in the U.S., and arguably accelerating unit growth in the U.S. has contributed to some of your problems and I think you\u2019ll readily admit that. ", "Can you help me understand why you are making that decision when in essence it might actually be dilutive for corporate return?", "Peter J. Bocian", "I think a lot of these we will have a better clarity on April 30th, but as I said before, when we showed up in 2007 and we had 8% -- I think it was 8.1% of revenue in international, given the number of licensed content in there, it\u2019s clearly under-performing. We had a pretty good Q1, though you could argue it was against a weak 2007 compare but our view is that we can take these international margins into the teens and we\u2019ll wait for April 30th for the answer, but also the amount of capital we have to invest because of the license relationship is much less. ", "And lastly, if you look at the absolute number compared to where the U.S. is and think about rest of globe non-U.S., there is still a huge opportunity for us. So all the above, we actually think international can contribute quite a lot towards the portfolio and therefore speeding up the investment somewhat. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Howard Penney of FBR Capital Markets. ", "Howard Penney - FBR Capital Markets", "This is just one person\u2019s opinion but I don\u2019t think there is anybody that doesn\u2019t believe Starbucks can\u2019t grow. I guess it\u2019s the rate of growth the company has and is it maximizing the value to shareholders of that growth, balancing both growth and reinvestment in the business. ", "Having said that, you talk about an innovation price tag when asked about capital spending, would suggest that there is maybe remodels or is part of the innovation, is it you are going to reinvest in the store base and go through a remodeling program? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard you talk about that. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s part of your program, but if you can address that, that would be great. ", "Howard Schultz", "Howard, thank you. I think you\u2019ve been following the company perhaps as long as anybody and the thing about the growth, which I just want to clarify, is I think we all recognize the discipline and the thoughtfulness that we need to demonstrate in terms of the growth being profitable. ", "And there is no one around this table or on our board that is interested in any kind of growth that is not skewed towards making sure that we provide long-term value for the shareholders and it has to be profitable and thoughtful and disciplined growth. ", "Having said that, the issue of innovation and remodels, I think we need to separate that. We have an ongoing remodeling campaign that extends across the country and now across the globe that is not part of what Pete alluded to. ", "We believe that we have unique opportunities to advance the premium position and the experience in our stores around innovation and I wouldn\u2019t have anyone go off on this call and conclude that that\u2019s going to dramatically change the balance sheet or how Pete has described it. ", "Pete, do you want to add anything to that?", "Peter J. Bocian", "No, I think what\u2019s important is that in the ongoing CapEx that we\u2019ve had let\u2019s say the last couple of years, there\u2019s always been a renovation component as well as a new store component. All I was answering in the previous question was there is some let\u2019s call it room against the $1.1 billion of capital that we started the year based on the new store count. It\u2019s not huge, first of all, and my only point was that there are some innovation ideas that may have some capital but neither one is huge in the scheme of things. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Lehman Brothers.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. Just a question on international, which you\u2019ve highlighted as obviously an area of strength and upside surprise. I\u2019m actually surprised not to see an even greater acceleration on the international openings in \u201909. Your guidance looks for 1,000-plus but now you are talking about \u201908 being pushed up to 975, with the U.S. slowing down and your prior comments of international strength, I was just wondering if you could talk about the thought process behind the international growth targets, perhaps inhibitors to even faster growth, especially with the recent momentum. Thanks. ", "Peter J. Bocian", "I think the \u201909 data points around U.S. and international was mostly to A, show that the U.S. would continue the momentum around less. The over 1,000 was a directional number to show the crossover point. We\u2019ll come back with the actual number as we go through it. ", "So yes, we absolutely believe there is a great opportunity in international. My point for this year was to prove the operating margin expansion, which they\u2019ve started to do and we need to continue that through the year. And then we\u2019ll come back with the absolute number, over 1,000 for sure, when we talk about the momentum moving out to 2011. ", "Howard Schultz", "Martin, do you want to add something?", "Martin Coles", "Yeah. Hi, Jeffrey, thanks for the question. Internationally, we\u2019re very confident in the long-term upside for the business. We have to be equally careful though that we expand at the rate that we have capacity for, so it\u2019s less about the appetite of the market for our stores and our people, much more about carefully building our capabilities so that, as we\u2019ve talked about on this call today, that we continue to deliver just the very best Starbucks experience we can in every store that we open. ", "So we\u2019ve been on a significant growth curve ourselves in international in virtually every one of the last for our five years and we continue to expand that, but as Pete says, we\u2019ll come back with a better look at that number but a lot of it comes down to our capability to drive to the expansion that the market truly can support. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Matt Difrisco of Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Matt Difrisco - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I have a question but also a couple of bookkeeping questions -- Pete, if you could just give us a little bit of a [guidance] with respect to the pace of openings for \u201908 because it does seem like that is a major contributor to the margins. Having less absolute store openings and less dilution from them on a year-over-year basis. ", "And then also, is it a correct assumption then to assume that it is a -- though you might be losing a comp by getting food out that in some cases, it\u2019s going to be a margin enhancing experience, or it could be in some quarters?", "And then lastly, just on G&A, if I look at where you are cutting, is this taking away what you had built up, expecting to build on the 1,600 to 1,700 stores you were doing a year, so you are sort of taking away the growth? Does that do something to the ability for you to grow again in the future, or is that saying that your future growth might be license and not company-owned growth?", "Peter J. Bocian", "I\u2019ll try to catch up on those questions. The first is that on the pace of store openings, what we have seen in the first quarter and reported, and then you can extrapolate out to the year, there are basically none of the closures, is the easiest way to say it, exist in the net number that you are looking at for Q1, so expect that those are balance of the year and then your point about some dilution from a new store is true. We should see that balance of year. ", "That said, there are some costs of getting out of the opportunity and the net of it is kind of a wash. So the closings coming in the future and it should be a net P&L kind of neutral. ", "On the food comment, on the breakfast sandwiches, we are going to be out by year-end. They will still be available, call it de-emphasized, and we\u2019ve been clear on the direction. Our goal is to have the food team come in with that right complementary breakfast food for our future to back-fill it as we get into \u201909. ", "Your point is valid that the margin percent between beverage and food is different but we want to have a lot more beverage and then complementary food, and then a breakfast menu that delivers what our customers are asking for. ", "And lastly on the G&A, I think what we\u2019ve done so far is more systematically leveraged what we have, which is -- you know, as opposed to let\u2019s call it an across-the-board where travel and entertainment doesn\u2019t happen for every group. We\u2019ve been much more I think thoughtful in planning ahead around which G&A groups need to grow to support the stores. ", "We still have, when I mentioned the word global platform earlier, we have the opportunity to get global owners thinking about how they deliver the most efficient and effective service to the enterprise and we\u2019ll be talking more about that when we look at the targets going into the April 30th timeframe. ", "And I think that\u2019s important, back to the disclosure comment earlier, we believe by moving to the longer term targets, we are actually putting something out there A, that hasn\u2019t been there, and we also think that long-term, the op-margin is the best link to shareholder value. Because we have a portfolio of businesses, whether it\u2019s the consumer products group, food service. Howard mentioned the license stores and international, and a cost take-out opportunity. ", "All those are going to feed the op-margin going forward and none of them directly link to same-store comps, as an example.", "So we believe getting a better view of the portfolio and with this cost takeout opportunity embedded, that\u2019s what we are driving for and we\u2019ve put a stake in the ground and said we are going to commit to fairly quickly turn out a long-term target. I would argue given the volatility in the U.S. business and all the things we are working on real-time, April 30th feels fairly aggressive. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair", "I was kind of curious on the trends in U.S. ticket growth. For quite a while, you\u2019ve been seeing trends there in excess of your actual price increase and it looks like that\u2019s stopped. So I\u2019m wondering whether or not you are seeing consumers trade down, if there might be a merchandise impact from this being a Christmas quarter or if there is a food impact here. But anything we could kind of glom on to to understand what is happening there. ", "Howard Schultz", "I think it\u2019s -- you know, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time over the last few weeks digging into our business and really trying to dissect the issues at every level, but clearly the consumer is facing a significant headwind that is affecting not only us but everyone in the retail and restaurant business. ", "I think you\u2019d have to agree that the consumer -- the consumer is in a recession. And in view of that, the trends that we see, either in terms of geography or across the board, are not isolated to any region or any product. ", "I think that what we believe is that we have an opportunity to enhance the experience, create significant separation between us and everybody else, and drive an experience that people value and recognize as not only different but something superior. ", "But we are facing a situation where the status quo no longer applies. We can\u2019t continue on that path and we have to push for self-renewal and reinvention and embrace change. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of John Ivankoe of J.P. Morgan.", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. I just want to make sure that the breakfast sandwich issue is being put into context. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in even half of the U.S. store base. Could you clarify what percentage of the stores that it\u2019s in? And I guess across the entire system, what percentage of sales it actually is? In other words, if it were to be pulled out, what that would actually mean to comps?", "And finally, on the breakfast side, was that product on a fully loaded basis in terms of looking at gross margin, you know, spoilage at the end of the day, incremental labor that you had against the product, which was clear going into the stores, whether that product in fact made money?", "And then secondly, you gave us a nice direction in terms of what could be possible in terms of breakfast, healthier products to replace the product. Is there any kind of innovation that might be significant around the lunch day part, which I think is more significant than the breakfast sandwiches?", "Howard Schultz", "I think that you hit the nail right on the head there in terms of the impact and the issues that relate to the true net margin that we receive as a result of being in that business. ", "I think, if I\u2019m not mistaken, the breakfast sandwiches are in less than 4,000 stores across North America and there were more stores that were ongoing in terms of plan that we have stopped, that are not going to be engaging in that business in the near future. ", "I think as we said in the past, I think on a revenue basis, we model those breakfast sandwiches at approximately $35,000 a store, with anomalies both at the bottom and the top end. ", "And the margin, we\u2019ve had margin compression in the overall unit economics as a result of being in that business because it is a lower margin product than the core beverage business. And there is incremental labor but perhaps more than that, there\u2019s mine share and labor that takes us away from executing on our core business -- that being the ability to make the perfect shot of espresso, the ability to describe different coffees and really I think demonstrate our position. ", "In terms of replacement, I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics but our food team understands with great clarity what the task is. They are accountable. They are responsible and we are committed to delivering a replacement category product in that day part. ", "With regard to lunch, I\u2019m not going to go there, other than to say that we are going to be in the lunch business. We are going to modify it, as I\u2019ve already said, and we are going to look at other alternatives as we are looking at this. ", "But we understand the leverage that we have with our customer base and we understand that the things that we want to do have to relate to our core and have to be consistent in terms of quality and we have to measure that quality against the quality of our coffee.

My name is Christian and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Starbucks Coffee Company second quarter fiscal 2008 financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions) Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations at Starbucks Coffee Company. With me today are Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; and Pete Bocian, Executive Vice President and CFO. Q&A will follow today\u2019s prepared remarks. ", "As a reminder to all listeners, this call is being broadcast live over the Internet. A replay will be available via telephone at 800-642-1687, reservation number 22250367 through 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Friday, May 2, 2008, and on the investor relations page at starbucks.com through 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Friday, May 30, 2008.", "In addition, today\u2019s remarks will be available on the investor relations portion of starbucks.com by the end of the day today and will remain available through Friday, May 30, 2008.", "This conference call includes forward-looking statements about company plans and initiatives, including its transformation agenda, and trends in or expectations regarding revenue and earnings per share growth, net new store openings, free cash flow, the performance of the U.S. economy, same-store sales growth, operating margins, expense control, the company\u2019s effective tax rate, shareholder value, capital expenditures, guidance and targets, and capital structure. ", "These forward-looking statements are all based on currently available operating, financial, and competitive information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties.", "Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the risk factors section of Starbucks' annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, and Starbucks' quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2007. ", "The company assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.", "In addition, during this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information related to the corresponding GAAP measures and reconciliation of the non-GAAP and GAAP measures can be found in our press release on the company\u2019s website at starbucks.com. ", "We also want to inform you that we have scheduled Starbucks' fiscal 2009 bi-annual analyst conference, which will be held in New York for the first time. We suggest you save the date of Thursday, December 4th and we\u2019ll provide additional details on the event in the coming months. ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard. ", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I hope you\u2019ve had a chance to read the release we\u2019ve issued just a little while ago. ", "During today\u2019s call I will give you an update on the progress we\u2019ve made since our January 30th conference call in laying the foundation for a renewed customer experience at Starbucks. Pete will then take you through a review of our second-quarter results, provide an update on the full year, and then spend most of his time walking you through our three-year financial targets, including the key financial metrics for the company looking out to 2011. These will include our targets representing a significant slowing of store expansion in the U.S. while accelerating International unit growth and our expectations for revenues, operating margins and EPS coming off a plan that requires less capital expenditures and delivers significant free cash flow into the future.  ", "As you think through all of what we are sharing with you today, I want you to have an understanding of the main considerations we -- meaning our Board of Directors and our management team -- took into account in developing our plans for the rest of 2008 and for the 2009-2011 period, and we will discuss all these over the course of this call.  ", "To put it simply, our approach has been one of balance, recognizing current economic conditions and their impact on the operating environment while also remaining highly focused and committed to the long-term significant opportunities for our business.  ", "We have a very realistic view of the current and growing pressures on consumers in the U.S. and increasingly in other key markets around the world where we operate. And we are intent on best managing our plans to match the demand we see, scaling back our openings, and rigorously managing our expenditures in all areas where they are not critical to our mission.  ", "At the same time, we want to continue to innovate and invest in those areas that preserve and reinvigorate the uniqueness of the Starbucks Experience through our transformation agenda, so that we continue to grow our business and are well-positioned when economic conditions improve. You will see all of this reflected in our targets for revenue, CapEx, margins, EPS, and cash flow, which we are sharing with you today.   ", "With that, I would like to first comment briefly on our announcement last week of Q2 preliminary results and our revised outlook for fiscal 2008.  Once our second-quarter results were in, and in light of the deteriorating retail operating environment in the U.S., we updated our view of the year and felt it was the right thing to do to quickly communicate our revised outlook to you.  ", "In our press release, we identified the impact of Q2 EPS from investments we made as part of our transformation agenda, along with costs associated with the rationalization of our store portfolio. And while they had a negative affect on our second-quarter bottom line, we firmly believe that these investments are necessary and prudent as we work hard to transform the way we do business.  ", "I should also mention that the benefits from these initiatives, such as the launch of Pike Place Roast, are not yet reflected in our results but they will be over time. ", "While we are not going to use the economy as an excuse, it is important to keep in mind that our second quarter results do reflect the sharp weakening U.S. consumer environment.  Like most other retailers and restaurants, we are experiencing a down-turn in customer traffic, demonstrated in reduced frequency of customer visits that we believe ties to a real reduction in consumers\u2019 discretionary spending habits.  ", "With no immediate signs of recovery, this underscores why, as I will discuss, we have reviewed all aspects of our operations to make sure we are best utilizing our resources and we are working hard to reduce expenses in non-critical areas. ", "At the same time, as I have said, it is incumbent upon us to maintain our focus on transforming our business for the future, so that we can deliver strong, sustainable performance over the long-term. ", "And we are making significant progress on the plan we announced to do this when I came back as CEO just 14 weeks ago, which centers on three things: improving the current state of the U.S. business, reigniting the emotional attachment with our people and our customers, and making fundamental changes for the long term.  ", "Today I am going to review with you the new initiatives we have launched to date as well as give you an early look at some exciting things we have ahead of us this year and beyond. And I can assure you that we have the focus, commitment and excitement of our management team behind us in these efforts as we believe that we can deliver on this will strengthen our business, enhance our relationship with our customers by reminding them of why the Starbucks Experience is unique and only getting better as we further build on our leadership position.   ", "The first action we outlined in our Transformation Agenda was slowing the pace of U.S. store openings by lowering our U.S. net new store opening target by around 425 stores in this fiscal year. Today you saw in our press release that we have taken down our store opening target even further, including the reduction of an additional 30 company-operated stores and over 125 licensed stores from our fiscal \u201808 opening target.  ", "We now expect to open around 1,020 net new stores in fiscal \u201808 in the U.S, down from the nearly 1,800 stores we opened in the U.S. in fiscal \u201807.  That includes the previously announced closing of approximately 100 underperforming stores by year end.  ", "Importantly, we have also significantly reduced our previously announced U.S. store opening target for fiscal \u201809, down to 250 net new company-operated stores and less than 400 in total U.S. store openings, demonstrating our commitment to optimize our resources and reduce potential cannibalization of existing stores.    ", "The second area of focus we identified was taking decisive actions to enhance the Starbucks Experience and I am pleased to say we have made good progress to date in this area, with much more to come.  In February, we took our first step with our espresso excellence training, which demonstrated our commitment to partner engagement and training, and to improve the customer experience.   ", "While it\u2019s hard to measure the success of this program with financial metrics, it was crucial for us to infuse our store partners with energy, knowledge and renewed pride so that we could ensure that they were consistently and enthusiastically delivering the Starbucks Experience to our customers. The feedback we have received from both customers and partners has been very positive and the quality of our espresso beverages has clearly been enhanced. ", "On March 19th at our annual meeting, we announced several other important initiatives as part of our transformation agenda.  The first, which launched on April 8th, was our new everyday brewed coffee, Pike Place Roast. This smooth yet bold coffee developed by our coffee and roasting teams was designed to provide customers with a unique, consistent fresh-brewed coffee experience.  ", "At the same time, we also returned to our practice of grinding whole beans in our stores and brewing coffee every 30 minutes to provide our customers with the freshest coffee possible.   ", "While Pike Place Roast has only been in our stores for three weeks, we have seen a notable increase in the number of cups of brewed coffee sold per day, particularly in the Northeast region, which is our largest brewed market.  This aligns with our goal to increase our share of the overall brewed coffee market, where we believe that we have been under-represented and bring our brewed coffee share closer to the great success we have achieved in the espresso beverage space.  We are very pleased with the early success of this initiative, and it is still early.  ", "At the annual meeting, we announced two exciting initiatives directly related to enhancing the preparation and quality of our coffee offerings. The first was the next generation of espresso machines exclusive to Starbucks -- the Mastrena -- which is the result of five years of development and collaboration between Starbucks and one of the world\u2019s leading espresso machine manufacturers.  ", "The technical advancement of Mastrena gives us a three- to five-year leap ahead of others in terms of the quality and precision of every espresso shot made.  In addition to elevating the quality of our beverages, the Mastrena also has a low physical profile, enabling our people to visually connect with our customers, something that we believe will significantly enhance both the barista and customer experience.  ", "By the end of 2008, more than 30% of U.S. company-operated stores will have the new machine and 75% will have it by the end of 2010.  Additionally, new international stores will receive the Mastrena starting this summer. ", "Another step toward elevating the coffee experience and further building on our brand leadership in the brewed coffee category was our acquisition of the Coffee Equipment Company and its revolutionary Clover Brewing System.  ", "The technology behind Clover, which has become the gold standard in innovation in brewing equipment, will allow us to deliver individual brewed cups of some of the rarest and most exotic Starbucks coffees to our most discerning customers.  The Clover\u2019s specialized brewing process blends the best of the vacuum pot and coffee press methods and further develops and unlocks the unique flavor nuances of specialty coffees.  ", "Clover is being very well received in our two test markets and we believe it provides another significant opportunity to differentiate the Starbucks Experience from all others.  Our current plans are to bring the Clover experience to customers in more than 80 of our U.S. company-operated stores in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco by the end of the calendar year.  ", "We also launched several additional programs intended to encourage further engagement from our customers.", "First, we recently introduced the first phase of our Starbucks Card Rewards program in which we will continue to explore ways in which we enhance the Starbucks experience using this platform to create rewards and new ways to say thank you and appreciation to our customers. ", "Second, we introduced MyStarbucksIdea.com -- a dynamic online community that allows us to deepen our relationship with our customers beyond the doors of our stores and cultivate ideas directly from this valuable group of people. Thousands and thousands of customers have been on that site and if you haven\u2019t seen it, you should go on it and see the attachment and the relationship that our customers have with our company.", "We have accomplished a lot in just a few short months, yet there is so much more going on behind the scenes in the way of innovation which I am excited about.  I have participated in all the new product development reviews and I am impressed by the level of creativity, uniqueness and relevancy of the innovation, which we believe will capture our customers\u2019 attention, create demand and drive traffic into our stores.  ", "As part of our next phase of transformation initiatives, we are focusing specifically on our cold and blended categories.  This summer you will see a significant amount of product innovation through three new beverage platforms designed to invigorate our cold beverage offerings.   ", "The first is Starbucks entry through the Starbucks DoubleShot platform into the energy beverage category.  This is a fast-growing segment with the $4.4 billion energy beverage market growing at a rate of 31% in 2007. Entering this category offers us a significant opportunity for us to complement our customers\u2019 lifestyles and engage an important and relatively un-tapped demographic for Starbucks. Other entrants into this space have used caffeine as a supplement within their energy beverages, which makes Starbucks a natural and we believe gives us a unique position in the marketplace with Starbucks coffee as well as the equity and strength of our brand. ", "With this introduction, and for the first time in the company\u2019s history, we are leveraging the assets of our JV partnership with Pepsi-Cola to expand our successful Starbucks DoubleShot platform across multiple channels to bring to the market Starbucks Doubleshot and energy beverages in our retail stores and through the more traditional consumer products group channels.  ", "This new platform will include both customizable, handcrafted beverages in our stores and ready-to-drink energy beverages which will be available through Pepsi\u2019s nationwide distribution, complementing the system that created bottled Frappuccino.", "The combination of Starbucks strong brand awareness, our leadership in the ready-to-drink category and the strength of our partnership with Pepsi is a powerful and perhaps unparalleled combination.  Another advantage we have is the unique opportunity to also leverage the partnership\u2019s consumer advertising to raise awareness, which we believe will have a halo effect on our retail stores. ", "We are highly committed to the Health and Wellness category and see this as an important long-term growth driver for the company. More importantly, our entry into this category is consumer driven and is in direct response to our research, in which our customers told us they are looking for healthy beverages and food offerings from Starbucks that will give them energy and deliver real nutrition, while also tasting great and with moderate calories.  ", "This summer, we will make our first significant step forward into this category with the introduction of a Health and Wellness beverage platform.  Through our extensive research and development, we believe we have hit the mark with the protein and fruit-blended beverage we have developed, which is made from simple ingredients that provide the benefit of sustained energy that our customers want.  ", "This new beverage will initially be available in two flavors and will include fresh fruit and a proprietary whey protein, with no artificial sweeteners, delivering 15 or more grams of protein with no more than 270 calories.   ", "We have been testing these beverages in our stores and we have received very positive response from our customers and partners, even exceeding our early expectations.  In our research, more than 60% of customers surveyed said they would come to Starbucks to buy healthy, nutritious beverages and we are confident we have found the perfect answer to their needs.  ", "Importantly, this is just the beginning.  We have a strong pipeline of many new relevant products that we plan to introduce through the rest of the year.  ", "Lastly, as our Frappuccino category matures and as others have tried to repeat our success, it is critical for us to continue to pioneer new types of beverages to meet the cold beverage need.  We have been searching for some time for a cold beverage concept that would create the type of taste and proprietary nature and customer excitement that our Frappuccino blended beverages did over 10 years ago.  We searched the world over and have found something finally that took us back to our heritage.   ", "On a recent trip to Italy, we found a unique beverage platform that we believe to be a perfect complement to our overall beverage business.  This exclusive, proprietary opportunity was developed through a partnership with our Italian supplier and represents a brand new category of beverage, which is both refreshing, low calorie, and indulgent at the same time. It offers a unique frozen, smooth texture, distinctive taste profiles and options ranging from fruit-based to dairy-based to yogurt-based ingredients. ", "We are rapidly developing the line-up and have plans to first launch these beverages mid-summer in parts of California. We have segmented that specific market for this exciting product launch because it is a significant market for us, one which is also experiencing some of the most difficult challenges due to the current economic environment. And it is also a region that has a strong preference for a robust cold beverage line-up.  ", "We are confident that this unique breakthrough beverage category will be received with great enthusiasm by our customers in California, which is just the precursor to a national launch in fiscal 2009.  ", "And we believe customer acceptance of this new distinctive beverage category will create a new demand, drive incremental traffic to our stores much like Frappuccino did 10 years ago. ", "While beverages are our core competency and our primary focus, we also remain committed to enhancing our complementary food offerings, which includes successfully replacing our warmed breakfast sandwiches with a range of healthy, unique and great-tasting breakfast alternatives.  ", "We have made great progress in this area and with other products in our food line up, with a special tie-in to our beverage and health and wellness focus. Our food transformation begins with the launch of new, nutritious breakfast foods in September, continues with the replacement of our current breakfast sandwiches in the early part of Q1, and will be followed by the roll-out of a new, higher-quality, proprietary bakery and chilled foods program.  ", "As evidence of the strong momentum that we have going, we can look ahead to Holiday and even to early 2009 with a great deal of excitement for the products and offerings in our pipeline.  ", "For Holiday, we will offer our traditional limited-time- offering Starbucks Christmas Blend whole bean coffee, which our customers will find even more flavorful than past seasons, with an unparalleled taste and profile.  We have also streamlined and re-focused our merchandise to offer our customers a selection of items unique to Starbucks at attractive price points given the tough operating environment.   ", "In calendar 2009, we believe we will really push the innovation envelope with an entirely new multi-channel product launch that will create a new category in the coffee arena.  This opportunity will allow us to leverage our assets to create a new platform based on new technology and the power of our brand and distribution network.  Stay tuned. ", "It should be clear that we are invigorated and Starbucks is coming back strong in delivering innovation and creativity. With all the new and unique products currently under development and in test, we are confident that we will deliver an elevated level of relevant innovation that will resonate with our customers and create new demand in our stores and at the same time, rest assured we will reaffirm our leadership position in all things coffee.  ", "Along with our focus on innovation over the past few months, we have also taken a close look at every aspect of our business, and I said to our people and I say it to you, that there are no sacred cows. This has and will continue to include scrutinizing and evaluating everything we do against our core business and our long-term strategic intent to ensure that we are making the right decisions and running the business in a way that is right for our customers and adds value for our shareholders.  ", "This led us to last week\u2019s difficult announcement of our decision to refine our entertainment strategy and restructure our entertainment business to focus on digital strategy and core content with music and books. ", "Music and books will play an integral part of our coffee house heritage and they will continue to play an important role, but we have restructured and streamlined this area of our business in a way that will allow us to leverage key partnerships and focus on initiatives that will add value to our customers in a much more cost-effective and balanced way.   ", "Reshaping the entertainment business is just one example of the critical review of all aspects of our business model that is taking place throughout the organization as we work diligently on initiatives to strengthen the business for the future.  ", "And while many of these actions require investment, we also intend to realize opportunities to leverage back-end costs and drive efficiencies throughout the business.  ", "Further, before we enter fiscal 2009 in October, we are committed to taking additional cost out of our non-customer facing expense areas to better protect the profit commitment that we have made to you.  ", "And as we look over the next three years, there are a number of things firmly within our control -- our costs and expense budgets, the capital we allocate to the business and the amount of investment we make in these initiatives.  Most importantly, we are focused on controlling and balancing all of that and maintaining a discipline on driving investment and initiatives that we believe will drive traffic and therefore drive revenue into our stores.  ", "The transformation we are currently undertaking wouldn\u2019t be possible without a strong organizational structure.  During the first quarter, we further strengthened our management team with the alignment of key roles and the addition of new positions to form a leadership team with a laser focus on our customers and our partners.  And more recently, we have announced two additional appointments, which further bolster our management structure in positions that are directly tied to the success of our transformation agenda.  ", "At the business unit level, Cliff Burrows, previously president of our EMEA, was appointed to the position of President Starbucks Coffee U.S.  Cliff has led our business and brand to tremendous success in that part of the world and most recently was the head of our U.K. business.  He is now applying that same drive and business acumen to leading our U.S. business, and the business could not be in better hands.   ", "Also during the second quarter, we welcomed back Arthur Rubinfeld, a former Starbucks executive who returned to the company in the new role of President of Global Development.  In this newly created position, Arthur is responsible for management of the global store portfolio including site selection, design and creative concepts for Starbucks stores worldwide.  His first priority has been to conduct a thorough and comprehensive review and analysis of our current store portfolio to identify those areas where we are fully represented, to make sure that we are in the best possible position to locate our stores for customer traffic and to carefully assess the appropriate growth opportunities ahead to support our long-term success.   ", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Pete, who will review our Q2 results and then provide some further information about our long-term financial plans and the metrics we believe are critical to assessing our progress in the transformation of Starbucks.", "Peter J. Bocian", "Thanks, Howard and good afternoon, everyone. We recognize we have given you a lot of information in the last week -- particularly today with the communication of our long-range financial targets. I plan to spend most of my time today on the long range targets, but will also provide a recap of our fiscal 2008 second quarter and give you our latest full view on the full year.  ", "Then we will move into Q&A and recognizing there will be a greater number of questions today, we have allocated additional time for Q&A and plan to keep the call open until 3:30 p.m. Pacific Time.  ", "Now, looking at Q2 -- as reflected in our pre-announcement last week, Q2 proved to be a more challenging quarter than we anticipated going into the quarter.   ", "Revenues for the quarter were up 12% to $2.5 billion, from $2.3 billion a year ago, our lowest year-over-year increase to date.  As we disclosed last week, the softness was driven by a mid-single-digit decline in U.S. comparable store sales, driven by decreased traffic, which we believe is directly related to the challenging economic environment. ", "Operating income for the quarter decreased to $178 million from $241 million in the prior year, and operating margins contracted 360 basis points to 7.1% from 10.7% a year ago.  This contraction was primarily driven by the U.S. business, although both the International and CPG businesses experienced margin pressure in the quarter as well. I will provide additional detail around the drivers behind the margin compression in each of the segment discussions, but contributing to both the U.S. and International margin erosion was the Q2 negative impact of the changes we are making with the implementation of the transformation agenda and charges related to the rationalization of our store portfolio. ", "Earnings per share was $0.15 cents in the second quarter of this fiscal year, compared to $0.19 cents per share in Q2 of last year. The fiscal Q2 2008 second quarter EPS was negatively impacted by approximately 3 cents of costs associated with transformation and charges related to the rationalization of our store portfolio. ", "Non-operating factors impacting net earnings for the quarter included higher interest expense -- driven by an increased level of debt compared to the second quarter of 2007, which was used for share repurchases. We had a better effective tax rate year over year, primarily resulting from a larger contribution from international earnings in the quarter.  We also had a lower share count year over year, based on prior share repurchase activity.  I\u2019ll talk more about share buybacks later in my remarks, both for the quarter, the balance of the year, and in the context of the long range plan. ", "Let me now cover our operating segments second-quarter results. ", "U.S. total net revenues increased by 8% to $1.9 billion in the second quarter of fiscal \u201808.  Company-operated retail revenues, which represent 89% of total U.S. revenues, also rose 8% to $1.7 billion for the quarter.  ", "As we disclosed last week, contributing to the slower growth in U.S. retail revenues was the softness in existing store sales, down mid-single digits in year-on-year comps, as well as a slower ramp of revenues from new stores. We believe the major driver to be the current economic environment, which is resulting in lower frequency of customer visits to the stores. ", "It is also important to note that Q2 had very little impact from the benefit of innovation that Howard talked about in his remarks, with most of the significant announcements from our annual meeting going live in April, at the start of our Q3.    ", "U.S. cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues increased 180 basis points to 41.4%, compared to 39.6% in Q2 of last year.  This was chiefly driven by lower than expected sales coupled with occupancy costs from higher rent expense, driven by the new stores.  We also had higher dairy costs and, in the quarter, dairy cost the company about $0.01 of EPS year-on-year.   ", "U.S. store operating expenses increased 320 basis points to 44.2% of related U.S. retail revenues compared with 41% a year ago. Approximately half of the increase was related to soft revenues and the other half to transformation initiatives and the rationalization of our U.S. store portfolio. ", "In the quarter, we wrote-off costs associated with terminating future site commitments, along with the associated inventory and store assets. We have yet to recognize much of the impact from the planned closures of 100 stores, which we still expect to complete in the balance of the year.     ", "U.S. operating income declined to $194 million for the quarter, from $268 million in Q2 of fiscal \u201807.  Operating margins experienced significant compression to 10% of total revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2008, compared to 15% of revenue a year ago, due to lower levels of traffic in our stores, along with higher store operating expenses and higher cost of sales and occupancy costs. ", "Moving now to results for our International business, International total net revenues increased 27% to $493 million in the second quarter from $387 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201807.  Company-operated retail revenues increased 27% to $417 million, primarily due to the opening of 314 new company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and favorable foreign exchange primarily from the Canadian dollar. ", "International operating income decreased 16% to $18 million in the second quarter compared to $21 million a year ago. Operating margins for Q2 were about 4%, down 180-basis points from Q2 of 2007. The most significant contributor to the decline in operating margins was related to the store portfolio rationalization activities and the transformation costs incurred in the quarter. Also, we did see some early signs of softness in traffic in our UK stores.  ", "On a year-to-date basis, operating margins are roughly 100 basis points ahead of prior year, excluding the Q2 costs mentioned earlier. We will talk more about our expectations for International operating margin expansion when we talk about the long range plan.   ", "Now let me turn to results from our Global Consumer Products Group. Total net revenues for CPG increased 22% to $96 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, primarily driven by higher sales volumes of packaged coffee and tea in the U.S.   ", "Operating income for CPG rose 13% to $43 million in the second quarter, compared to $38 million in the same period a year ago. The operating margin compressed 350 basis points to 44.3% of related revenues, from the 47.8% reported in Q2 of fiscal \u201807, primarily driven by lower income from equity investees as a result of product write-offs within the NACP partnership. We still expect total year operating margins for this business at around 50% in 2008. ", "During the quarter, the company did not repurchase any shares, after purchases of a total of 12.6 million shares at a cost of $342 million in Q4 of 2007 and another 12.2 million shares in Q1 2008 at a cost of $295 million. Our plan for the balance of the year is to be relatively conservative in our use of cash given the current operating environment.  ", "Now turning to updates to our total year 2008 outlook, over the past several months, we have continued to reduce the number of net new store openings we have slated for the year in the U.S.  As Howard mentioned, we have lowered the U.S. store opening target to 1,020 net new stores, down from 1,788 stores in 2007, and from the target of 1,175 we communicated in January. The break-out of the stores is expected to be about 620 company-operated and 400 licensed. We are keeping the international store opening target at the 975 store update we provided on the Q1 call.    ", "We still expect capital expenditures to be about $1.1 billion for the year, with the reduction in new store investment being offset by investments in innovation. ", "We expect consolidated revenue growth of 13% to 14% for the year, with year-to-date revenue growth at 15%. Last week we communicated directional guidance for 2008 based on the reduced traffic and related lower revenue and profit in our U.S. business. We provided an estimate that EPS for FY08 would be somewhat lower than the $0.87 reported in fiscal 2007. This directional guidance reflects the uncertainty we have around consumer spending in the near term. ", "We saw significant deterioration in traffic in our stores sequentially from Q1 to Q2.  As a reference, each point of traffic in the U.S. in a quarter is worth about $0.01 of EPS.  We are in a volatile economic environment, with our innovation just launching.  We have cost take-out plans underway but can get limited in-year benefit.  ", "We believe we can hit a specific target range for \u201909, as we will get the full-year benefit of our cost take-out plans. We also expect to realize the international margin opportunity, and innovation will have a full-year of impact on the U.S. business. With that, let me move to our three-year view.   ", "On last quarter\u2019s call, we committed to providing you with quantifiable, longer-term financial metrics so you could better measure our progress as we continue to take advantage of growth opportunities globally, but with a renewed focus on use of capital and creating long-term shareholder value. ", "To accomplish this, we moved up our long range planning process, and fast-tracked the development of the business cases around our key initiatives. And, while one could argue the timing is not the best in terms of the current economic environment, we believe it is absolutely the right time to set the stake in the ground, align the organization with a clear focus and direction, and move quickly into execution. ", "Before I review the key components of the long range plan, I\u2019d like to go through some of our thought process in working through the targets for the company.  ", "First, we had a strong focus on controllables: cost and expenses, stores, and overall capital expenditures; second, we made a commitment on international to deliver the growth and margin potential of the heavily licensed model; third, we needed to stabilize the U.S. business, to grow earnings with a more conservative assumption around same store sales growth; and lastly, we made sure we had significant investment in the customer experience to drive traffic.   ", "Now, let me go through the details, which are included in the release. As it relates to our investment in stores, first we plan to reduce the number of net new store openings in the U.S. over the three-year period, to less than 400 stores per year, with approximately 250 company-operated stores opening in each period.   ", "Over the three-year period, we will open a total of 1200 stores, with the goal to make these our \u201cbest of the best\u201d opportunities. As a reference point, we opened 1,788 stores in 2007 alone, and were on a trajectory to grow that number in 2008.  ", "We plan to continue accelerating the unit growth in our international business, with net new store opening targets of 1,050 in 2009, 1,150 in 2010, and 1,300 in 2011.  We expect the mix of licensed stores to increase in international, with about 65% licensed over the three-year period.  ", "Factoring in the lower 2008 store target for the U.S., total store count at the end of 2011 will be about 21,500 stores, with stores in our international markets growing from about 30% of the total store portfolio today, to over 40% in 2011. International represents a good growth opportunity for us and also helps us balance the use of capital. ", "Looking at the use of capital, we expect capital expenditures of roughly $800 million per year, starting in fiscal 2009. This compares with about $1.1 billion of capital expenditures in both 2007 and 2008. We estimate that about 70% of the capital will be for investment in the stores. ", "Now shifting to revenue growth, we are targeting international revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 20% for the three-year period, driven by new store openings and continued growth in existing stores, though we anticipate a moderation in the pace of same store sales growth near term. ", "Our Consumer Products Group is expected to grow at least 15% per year through product and channel expansion.  The U.S. segment is expected to continue to grow but at a significantly slower pace, in line with the slowing of new store openings and more conservative expectations of same store sales growth. ", "For the U.S., we have assumed a continued difficult consumer economic environment near term.  As a result, we expect U.S. revenues to grow about 5% in 2011, and have a three-year compound annual growth rate of just over 6%.   ", "In 2011, total company revenues are expected to be just over $14 billion, which is a 10% three-year compound annual growth rate, with growth in 2009 expected higher than the 10%, and then moderating slightly over the three-year period.   ", "We have provided EPS target ranges for each year from \u201809 through \u2018011.  It is important to note that we intentionally broadened the ranges, to reflect both the greater uncertainty associated with the outer years, as well as the near-term uncertainty of the economic environment.  ", "For fiscal 2011, EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.50. For fiscal 2010, we anticipate EPS in the range of a $1.10 to $1.20. In 2009, we are targeting an EPS range of $0.90 to $1.00, as we continue to invest in our transformation agenda, with the benefits still in the early stages, and an assumption of a still difficult economic environment.  ", "In looking at operating margin, we expect international operating margin improvements of approximately 100 basis points per year, reaching an operating margin of about 12% in 2011.  CPG operating margin is expected to remain flat with fiscal \u201807 results, at about 50 points of operating margin each year.  We expect operating margin for the U.S. segment to stabilize after 2008, at an average of approximately 11.5% from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2011.   ", "We also expect to gain leverage of almost one point of revenue from unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses by 2011, from the reported 2007 levels, with the improvement spread proportionately over the four-year period. ", "With these segment operating margin targets and the improvement in the G&A spend outside the segments, we expect total company operating margin to improve over the three-year period from 2008 levels. However, it will remain below the 2007 operating margin of 11.2%, influenced by the U.S. business.   ", "And lastly, we expect our tax rate to improve to about 34% in \u201809, driven by a larger mix of International operating income, and to further improve to 33% in 2010 and 2011. ", "Moving now to free cash flow, based on the guidance we have provided today, we expect our performance to result in the generation of over $4.4 billion in cash from operating activities and have $2.4 billion in capital expenditures, leading to over $2 billion cumulative free cash flow from 2009 to 2011. ", "This compares to aggregate expected free cash flow of about $800 million from fiscal \u201806 to fiscal \u201808, with an expected $3.8 billion of cash from operating activities and $3 billion in capital expenditures. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less total capital expenditures.  We intend to use this excess cash to return value to shareholders through share repurchases or drive increased value through investment in new opportunities with attractive expected returns on capital. ", "Before I turn the call back over to Howard, I want to summarize what we communicated to you today: we defined how many new stores we will open -- we view this as within our  control; we defined the capital we will use over the next 3 years -- again, within our  control; we defined cost take-out actions, which show up in unallocated G&A, and in the businesses -- again, within our control; we defined our plan for international growth and margin expansion, shifting to a higher licensed partner contribution -- our view is this is a solid, balanced plan; Consumer Products continues at current operating margin levels, and grows through new channels and products -- we view this similar to the International plan. ", "We are left with the discussion of the U.S. business. What will be the near- and mid-term economic environment? And will our innovation have a material impact? We are a traffic-driven business, with beverages being the core. Howard talked today about the entire beverage line, and the coming innovations.   ", "In summary, we hope you leave today\u2019s call with a sense of our focus around the key elements in the plan with the knowledge we\u2019re working hard on what will create value long term -- the value proposition we offer our customers.   With that, I will turn the call back over to Howard for a few closing remarks and then we will open it up for Q&A.   ", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, Pete. Let me once again emphasize that 2008 is a year of transition for Starbucks; a year for us to re-energize and sharpen the focus on our brand and our business. Since I returned as CEO in January, we have taken decisive steps towards transforming Starbucks for the future. We are aggressively pursuing initiatives that will position us to capture the long-term opportunity.  This is balanced with what we believe to be a realistic expectation about the impact of the current economic environment.    ", "The next few years will be a period of sensible, strategic and exciting growth for Starbucks, centered on strengthening our business model, enabling us to maintain our position as one of the worlds\u2019 most recognized and respected brands, and to increase shareholder value in a way that is sustainable and in line with what you expect from us.", "With that, I am happy to open it up for Q&A. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. ", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks very much. Pete, I wanted to go back to your long-term earnings outlook and it seems as if you are calling for over 20, even 25% earnings growth on the out years, so can you help us break down operating profit growth and what the buy-back contribution is? It would seem that it is going to be heavily reliant on buy-backs, but -- and can you also talk about maybe your decision to use buy-backs versus say a dividend policy to communicate the maturation of the business to investors?", "Peter J. Bocian", "I think the first is there is share repurchase in the long-range plan but I would characterize it as 10% growth coupled with operating margin expansion off of an \u201908 baseline, right? So your 20% is off \u201908. If you move back to \u201907, not as dramatic. So my view is we\u2019ve got to improve, stabilize the U.S. operating margins, improve the U.S., get the lift out of consumer products group, contribute the G&A, and operating margin will improve over the horizon. In addition then, we get some lift out of share repurchases and out of the tax rate over time. ", "Relative to your second question, historically we have used share repurchases. We\u2019ll continue to dialog with the board. The good news is with the $800 million per year of capital that we expect to spend, there should be a lot more free cash flow. So I will leave it as there will be we expect significant value to return to the shareholders. Historically we\u2019ve used share repurchases -- not in a position today to really talk in detail around dividend but we\u2019ll have the dialog with the board over time. ", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "If I could just follow-up with one other question -- to what extent have you considered expanding the role of licensing in the U.S. as the business is maturing, the returns have gone down? You talk about no sacred cows -- would you consider relicensing or refranchising a portion of the U.S. business?", "Howard Schultz", "When we look at licensing as a part of the portfolio, I think one thing that we can look back on is that perhaps the number of licenses and some of the license partners was too much, and we want to dial that back. I think we have to make sure that the level of execution and the experience is compatible with what we believe to be the most important component. And when we\u2019ve had issues and tension, more often than not it\u2019s been on those licensed stores. ", "So we want to be very prudent in not chasing an economic model that in any way would dilute the integrity of the experience. ", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of  Joseph Buckley with Bear Stearns.", "Joseph Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Thank you. A couple of questions -- the CapEx number in \u201908 not changing you attribute to capital spending related to the transformation agenda. What exactly is that? What is the CapEx on the transformation side?", "Peter J. Bocian", "Yeah, you\u2019re correct. The CapEx would have gone down based on lower company-operated store openings. The CapEx we are talking about when you think about the clover, so putting the clover machine in the stores, Mastrena has a capital component, the beverages that Howard described leveraged some of the infrastructure but could have their own unique capital components as well. So that\u2019s really where call it the back-fill is happening. ", "And then we plan to incorporate all of those within the $800 million each year looking forward. ", "Joseph Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Okay, and then a question on the international side for the quarter, you mentioned the margins being hit by some of the rationalizations and you made reference to softness in some of the key international markets, I guess the U.K. specifically. Talk about what you did in the quarter -- did you have store closings in the U.K. or Canada and what\u2019s kind of the game plan there going forward?", "Peter J. Bocian", "Without naming the market, we are looking at the stores, it was not Canada or the U.K., and rationalizing and not dissimilar to the 100 stores that we\u2019ve talked about for the U.S. So there is some element of that and it was fairly material when you look at the size of the impact for international in the quarter. ", "So what I tried to do was bridge you, relatively speaking, that on a full-year basis if you normalize roughly speaking for the store rationalization and then some element of transformation. For example, we did have the Espresso Excellence training in Canada, as an example, which had an impact in the quarter. If you normalize for those, we had a great first quarter relative to 180 basis points. We are back kind of in the 100 basis point range after Q2 excluding the items I talked about. ", "Howard, do you want to talk about the U.K. traffic a little bit?", "Howard Schultz", "Well, I think what we\u2019ve shared with you today is that there is some sign, and I wouldn\u2019t get too excited about it today because we don\u2019t have enough information but there is some sign that there is a softening in the U.K. business due to the economic issues facing that consumer. And as we speak to other retailers, both U.S. and abroad that are doing business there, we are not alone. It is really yet to be seen whether or not that is going to be a mirror image of what we have experienced here or whether or not that is going to be a short-term situation. We don\u2019t know. ", "Joseph Buckley - Bear Stearns", "I see. Just one more question on the store rationalization; so did you close stores in some international markets during the quarter?", "Peter J. Bocian", "We took charges against the P&L relative to eventually being in a position to do that. ", "Joseph Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. ", "Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray", "I just wanted to ask about the executive succession planning at the end of this three-year turnaround phase and what is really the milestone that you are looking to achieve to measure a successful turnaround?", "Howard Schultz", "Well, you are talking about successful turnaround or succession planning?", "Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray", "I guess two questions then, however you\u2019d like to address it -- both. ", "Howard Schultz", "Well, in terms of succession planning, I\u2019ve made a commitment to the board and to our people that I am here for the long-term and I have a -- there\u2019s no -- I\u2019m not looking behind me to say once we do X or Y, it\u2019s time for me to find a successor. I am here for the long-term to lead the company back to the position it\u2019s been and deeply committed to that process. ", "The management team is strong. There\u2019s lots of people within our organization that are heavily tenured and the organization I think is organized the right way but we are all looking at the same thing and that is a deep, comprehensive, and individual commitment to the long-term. ", "In terms of milestones, prior to this past period, call it 18 months, we had the kind of relationship with our customers and our people and with our shareholders that basically exceeded expectations and we want to get back to the point where the level of confidence that you have in us is tied to where it once was. And we realize we have some work to do, but I don\u2019t want to get into the specifics. ", "We know that we\u2019ve got negative traffic. We are not accustomed to that. We\u2019re not happy with it. This is a management team in a company that is used to winning and we are built for that and we want to do that again. ", "Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray", "Thank you. I appreciate that color. Just a quick question on the numbers side -- when you talked about the free cash flow, you didn\u2019t mention paying down debt, so I guess we\u2019re to assume that you are implying that you will be at a net interest expense situation in the P&L. Is that right?", "Peter J. Bocian", "We have some long-term debt, about $550 million and then we have some short-term. Keeping that kind of leverage across the horizon is probably a good assumption. ", "Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, and then just my last question on the numbers -- what are the conditions under which the U.S. operating margin could expand? Or asked another way, what are the constraints?", "Peter J. Bocian", "First, we do believe \u201908 is a recalibration versus \u201907. Then we are cautious on how fast the economy turns and what the new kind of increase in traffic per year will be going forward. ", "That said, we are very optimistic about all the innovation. We just haven\u2019t baked it all in to the financial targets. So what I would describe as the up-side would be the innovation and/or the environment being better than we have baked in. So I view it as we\u2019ve tried to be relatively conservative. You can discuss that against different measures of how bad the economy -- one person expects it to be but we\u2019ve tried to bake in relatively conservative, which says we maintain the U.S. operating margins that we expect in \u201908 and you can pretty much figure those out based on our directional guidance, and then maintain those through the horizon. ", "There is a lot of opportunity I believe with the innovation to hit a home run. We haven\u2019t baked it in. ", "Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray", "And how do commodities play a factor?", "Peter J. Bocian", "We have some element of coffee and diary increases baked in. We also on the other hand have supply chain efficiencies and other procurement savings baked in, so I think not a material hit across the horizon. But we do expect to get efficiencies to offset what could happen. So we are not expecting dramatic changes and we\u2019ve done a pretty good job in coffee, for example. If you look at this year, we may take a penny hit in coffee, which is pretty good given the size of the commodity. Dairy is going to be about $0.03 for the year. ", "So overall, I think the team has done a great job in the coffee space and managing it. We can afford it to increase some over the horizon and then we are working on a number of things in procurement, supply chain, and cost and expense to mitigate it if it was bigger than our plan. ", "Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Lehman Brothers.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Great. Thank you. Actually, a couple of questions -- one just on international, as it becomes a larger portion of your business. Can you talk about maybe some of the markets where you are actually seeing the greatest success, perhaps a couple of key sales and margin levels? I think you mentioned international represents, or will represent 40% of your global portfolio, up from the current 30. So I was just wondering as an add-on, what about the percentage of profit from international? And then I had a follow-up. ", "Howard Schultz", "I\u2019ll start and then Pete can jump in. When you look back on the fact that we opened our first international store in August of \u201996 in Japan, and now in 44 countries, I think the headline reads that Starbucks has proven that the experience we\u2019ve created in our stores is highly relevant and with great acceptance across very different markets, cultures, and whether we are pioneering in China or going to Western Europe where coffee has been there for hundreds of years have demonstrated great success. ", "We\u2019ve had unique experiences in many places with the upside probably the greatest in China in terms of number of stores and the real big prize there. But then you look at a country like Mexico where we probably in the initial business plan at most probably had 100 to 150 stores. We\u2019ve been there five years. We\u2019re close to 250 stores, just named best company to work for in Mexico, fantastic business there and that business will grow north of 500 stores. ", "And there\u2019s many markets like that, so I look at the U.K. and Japan, which have about 800 and 700 stores respectively, we\u2019re still not showing any signs of hitting the wall in terms of saturation except of the near-term issue about the economy in the U.K. You know, we are very bullish on the international opportunity and the fact that we think we really haven\u2019t gotten the economic leverage that Pete talked about in his formal remarks, which I think he\u2019ll talk about now. ", "Peter J. Bocian", "I think to date, certainly the fact that it is heavily licensed means we don\u2019t count the system sales so the revenue is not as big as the revenue of the U.S., but as you look out, when you run the numbers, a 20% growth rate with 100 basis points of op margin getting to 12% in 2011, that pot of operating income is big for the company. So you\u2019ve got a compound annual growth rate of over 30% on the OI. So it moves -- it won\u2019t be as big on the revenue side as the store portfolio by the nature of how we count the revenue, but it will move to a more material part of the company. And then I think the message is also that given the amount of licensed, I would argue at 12%, we still have room to go because we don\u2019t count all the revenue, therefore we should have a much higher percent of revenue in reported and op income. ", "So my view is this is a stake in the ground for the next three years. We\u2019ve been treading water kind of OI as a percent of revenue in international for a couple of years and we need to do both -- grow at a healthy rate and then get the op margin expansion and it helps broaden the portfolio so we are not so U.S. dependent relative to where the profit comes.  ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "And in terms of those most successful international markets, are you seeing operating margins above the U.S.?", "Peter J. Bocian", "What I\u2019ve talked about before is that -- and this will be against an \u201907 U.S., is that Canada is approaching the U.S. kind of margins. There is still more challenges around the spread. From a company-owned market, the U.K. is improving but behind Canada, and then the other big market that will be company-owned will be China, and I would describe that as in the early stages. Don\u2019t need as much revenue to get store profitability but a lot of infrastructure to make sure we do it right. ", "So you look at it, those are the three big ones. Then you move into the license space and some of the countries that Howard was talking about, whether it was Japan or Mexico. You know, we\u2019re getting the royalty and the components of the license relationship. ", "Howard Schultz", "One thing I would also add is that we are beginning to leverage the relationships that we have with our partners. So as an example, perhaps our best -- one of our best-performing partners is our partner in Mexico and the Middle East. In both those cases, our Mexico partner is our partner in Brazil and will be our partner as we open up Argentina. The Middle East business, which has been a great business for us with the Alshaya group is also our new partner in Russia. ", "So our partners want more geography and I think that bodes well for the fact that this is a business that they believe in and I think these are still the embryonic stages of the growth and development of our international business. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "And Howard, just one follow-up; I\u2019m just wondering if you can give any greater detail kind of from a U.S. base, but the consumer research you guys have been talking about recently showing that U.S. traffic declines are due more to economic pressures rather than the substitution with -- ", "Howard Schultz", "Well, I\u2019m glad you asked me that question because I had heard that there is some cynicism from the research and I just -- it\u2019s just black and white. It speaks for itself. So we went out. We\u2019ve done more research in the last three months than we\u2019ve done in a number of years, given the uncertainty of the economy and where the business is and the fact that we want to make some very big bets on the innovation pipeline. ", "But the first thing we wanted to really understand is that given the compression in traffic, we wanted to specifically understand what is driving customers to either come less frequently or not come at all. And the unequivocal data, and we\u2019ve shared this with our board and obviously our management team, is the fact that the economy is the top box why people are not coming as often or not coming for that treat. And then specifically when we asked are you going to other establishments in view of the fact that you are not coming to Starbucks, there is no indication whatsoever that we are losing business specifically to any one competitor or a new category of competitors. ", "And there is no silver lining in the fact that we have less customers coming to our stores now but the fact that it is -- the economy does demonstrate to us that we have a strong headwind that we need to understand and we are dealing with and it is different than any other time in our history. And as a result of that, we are trying to operate differently. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "So does that change your thought process in terms of offering greater value if they are not trading down, per se?", "Howard Schultz", "Well, I think that what we saw with the launch of Pike Place Roast is that we are getting some incrementality as a result of that brewed coffee and its unique taste, and also potentially we are getting people who have not come before because they\u2019ve been an espresso-based drinker or perhaps they are trading down. But we haven\u2019t seen that in terms of the average ticket. ", "When we launch the Italian beverage in California this summer, we will price that beverage to be what we would view as an affordable luxury and something that will be I think very interesting for our customers in view of the fact that it will be less expensive than Frappuccino. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Steven Kron with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Just looking at your targets a few years out of 11.5% in the U.S. and just looking at that compared to even just last year at 14.5, you know, 300 basis point degradation there. Just looking or assuming the sales improvements by that point will have kicked in and you know, the expense rationalization that you talk about, can you talk about some of the offsets here? I mean, are you expecting a mix change like the new products that you are introducing might be a lower margin product or what\u2019s going to prevent those margins from getting back? And I know you talked about maybe that\u2019s upside but it just struck me as a number that seemed pretty low, given where the business was just in fiscal \u201907. ", "Peter J. Bocian", "I think clearly the recalibration in \u201908 is the negative traffic on the store base, as there are other pressures, whether it\u2019s dairy, whether it\u2019s natural wage pressures that happen every year. So I view \u201908 as a starting point and then, taking conservative growth rates from there. ", "Clearly if we can beat the growth rates or they return to the comps of old and we are not putting that in the plan, that would be upside. But I think it\u2019s important that we are recalibrated on improving op income in the U.S. without significant comps from the new \u201908 baseline. I recognize it doesn\u2019t look favorable against \u201907 but I am trying to recalibrate our expectations going forward, and then looking for some element of upside if economy/innovation is better. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "So there is nothing else from the expense side that we should be expecting, whether it\u2019s a mix shift in cost of sales absent commodity inflation will continue to be a headwind or other types of store operating expenses?", "Peter J. Bocian", "No, it\u2019s really just the moderating of the growth rate is not -- you know, doesn\u2019t cover as much of the cost and expense that could and will increase somewhat over the horizon. ", "Howard Schultz", "I also want to add that this is a time when I think our management team and our board wants to create expectations that at a minimum we meet and we want to be conservative in our approach, especially in view of the fact that no one, at least around this table, can predict when the economy is going to change. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, fair enough. And then I guess Howard, obviously you mentioned this is a business that\u2019s built on transactions and you are focused back on your beverage, further emphasis on the beverage side of the business. It seems as though a lot of new products coming through over the course of the next 12 to 18 months, perhaps maybe fast-tracking some of the products, bringing them to market a little bit quicker. I guess in light of that, can you maybe discuss how your comfort level with the amount of testing you are doing on a lot of these products before bringing them into the stores, given that it is maybe on an faster profile?", "Howard Schultz", "Sure, yeah. Well, let\u2019s start with health and wellness first. We did a very good job of testing that under the radar in a number of stores over the past few months, coupled with the very strong response we got from research. And as I said in my remarks, that category really speaks volumes to our customers need states and we believe strongly that we provide our customers with a reason to come to Starbucks that is incremental to their coffee need. ", "The product tested well and exceeded the expectations we had in terms of units per day. We think we\u2019ve done a great job in terms of the flavor and I think it is important to note that we are not introducing a product -- we are creating a new platform in the company around beverages and food. And the food program is done. It is all ready to go. We will launch that in September, followed by the second tranche of food, which will come in the fall that will replace the breakfast sandwich. ", "But health and wellness beverages, we think we\u2019ve hit the mark and it\u2019s spot-on in terms of the trend. ", "The energy beverage, this is almost a $5 billion category, again leveraging Pepsi\u2019s distribution system as well as their manufacturing capability and leveraging the fact that we have license to play in that space and perhaps we should have been in it sooner, but we also will be the first retail establishment to create that product customized for our customer than then the halo that I think we\u2019ll get off Pepsi\u2019s system, like we did with bottled Frappuccino should drive traffic into our stores. It\u2019s also a younger customer, should be incremental. ", "Third, the Italian beverage is something we discovered. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about it. You know, the proof of everything is how it tastes and this is a product that is very unique in flavor, in profile, in texture and we think we\u2019ve got it right. ", "Not everything is equal here in terms of its -- you know, what we think it\u2019s going to do but we haven\u2019t had a lot of innovation at Starbucks for quite some time. We\u2019ve been in the business of building flavors and line extensions, and we\u2019re getting back off our heels and back on the offense and we are going to innovate like hell and bring new products and new excitement both to our customers and our people and we are going to get it right. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Carol Lintz with Pioneer Investment.", "Carol Lintz - Pioneer Investment", "I have a couple of questions; first, in your capital spending budget, how much of that is going to be for maintenance capital spending on the existing units? Second, in the food program, will this require additional equipment to be brought into the store or will food be brought in pre-prepared?", "And finally, in the new Italian beverage that is Cappuccino like, you mentioned I believe that the pricing is at a lower level than the current Frappuccino line. What impact would that have on margins?", "Howard Schultz", "Let me just take the back end -- so the new beverage, it\u2019s not Frappuccino like or Cappuccino like. It is a summer beverage that is both indulgent but low calorie and refreshing, and will be priced at an attractive price point. And I\u2019m not going to speak to margins on that for a whole host of reasons, but it meets the requirements that we\u2019ve always had for our beverage business. ", "In terms of food, there is no new equipment that is required for the food program. We are going to -- the food program will be enabled by the existing equipment and warming that we have in existing stores. ", "Peter J. Bocian", "Just adding on that, we did slow down or stop the rollout of warming until we had a clear view of the breakfast sandwich replacement, so we will pick that up but there\u2019s I think 3300 stores today that are already warming enabled and that\u2019s all we need to have for the new food rollout. ", "On your capital question, I defined of the $800 million per year about 70% is store and I just, rule of thumb, half and half between new store and renovation, roughly speaking. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Larry Miller with RBC Capital Markets.  ", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you very much. I had a couple of questions on the international margins. First of all, I was under the impression that they were structurally lower than the U.S. and it sounds like that is going to reverse over the next couple of years when you get to 12% and the U.S. business 11%, so maybe you could help me understand why that might be. Thanks. ", "Peter J. Bocian", "I didn\u2019t want to get here by the U.S. going down and international going up, so that\u2019s the first data point and we\u2019ll work on the U.S. But structurally, it\u2019s actually the opposite, right? We count less of the system, less of the revenue for international. The profit dollars per revenue we count is higher in a license model, so structurally the question I\u2019ve often got is why is international better than U.S.? Because of the nature of the structure, so I think this plan shows good progress towards what should be a higher operating margin type model driven by the percent of licensed, and as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve been running about 40-60 -- 40% company-owned, 60% licensed historically. And then over this horizon, moving to 65%-plus licensed, so we\u2019ve been getting more leverage out of the structural relationship. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Matt Difrisco with Oppenheimer. ", "Matt Difrisco - Oppenheimer", "Thank you. My question is I think Howard, you made a comment earlier in the call here about Pike\u2019s and you made a note that it didn\u2019t start until April and this is one of the key initiatives. I\u2019m just curious; the comment said that it was being well-received. Is that incremental or do you think that is somewhat substituting? And then I have a little bit of a follow-on there. ", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you. So it\u2019s a little bit more than three weeks in and we are getting some incrementality from the beverage, and so the encouraging news is that we are seeing -- first of all, we think we are, as I said in my remarks, under-represented in the brewed coffee space, which we think is a huge opportunity for us which we haven\u2019t focused on probably for 20 years. All of the emphasis and all of the excitement has always been on espresso and espresso beverages and that\u2019s where innovation has come. This is the first time we\u2019ve really I think created a new coffee that we think really speaks distinctively to doing something that really differentiates itself from everyone else. ", "The response has been very positive. We have gotten incrementality, strongest has been in the Northeast and we are early in but we are enthused. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan.", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. First a clarification, if I may; Pete, I just want to make sure that I heard you right regarding the international margins. Did you say that if it was excluding I guess store closure and transformation charges that margins would have been up 100 basis points in the second quarter, or would that be for the first half of 2008?", "Peter J. Bocian", "For the first half. We had a very strong Q1, some of it is related to timing but we were up -- so I said year-to-date, try to give you a sense of the size of the store rationalization and the transformation that all happened in Q2. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair", "Good afternoon. Howard, I\u2019m curious -- as you\u2019ve been implementing a lot of these initiatives in the U.S., have you seen any negative ramifications in terms of customer confusion or slower lines, reduced throughput?", "Howard Schultz", "No. I think we have a tool that we use, which we call customer voice, and that tool is for us to gauge the experience that our customers are having in the stores and whether or not -- and we obviously monitor this very, very often, both in terms of comparing it both in the near-term and over the long-term, and since espresso excellence training has come about, there is clearly a noticeable difference in the level of engagement. I think sometimes the lines have been a little bit longer because we are asking people to customize milk, to make shots in espresso shot glasses as opposed to in a paper cup. ", "But we\u2019ve encouraged our people to just say to the customer I\u2019m sorry, you might be waiting a little bit longer, but we want to make the drink perfect for you. And if anything, I think people have seen the fact that Starbucks is making a concerted effort to elevate the experience and the quality and so the short answer is we haven\u2019t seen anything that would give us pause that the transformation and the things that we are doing and bringing to the stores is causing anything but a net positive for us. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from the line of  Gary Magnusson with Smith Barney. ", "Gary Magnusson - Smith Barney", "Howard, with hiring back Arthur, have you explored -- I was sort of surprised with the slowdown in the store count in the U.S. and was wondering what you think about the possibility of locations in smaller towns? Can you give us some color just on the slowdown and maybe speeding up later on in the future?", "Howard Schultz", "Well, first off, we think it is absolutely the most disciplined and prudent decision to slow the U.S. growth down and to rationalize the store base. I think that\u2019s going to help us in terms of -- on a number of issues, but Arthur was the initial architect for both store design, real estate selection, construction, and really I think is the right person to come back and really author this new strategy for the company. ", "And the thing that he is working on is no longer domestic but he is working on the global portfolio of the company, and the areas that we are focused on in addition to the rationalization of the stores, more importantly than that is the future of the company and we are looking at different store formats, new store designs, and ways in which that we can create a local relevance to offset the growth and perhaps the ubiquity of the company. And that\u2019s what Arthur\u2019s strength is and there\u2019s lots of learnings that we have that we think we can bring to the marketplace. We have not talked about the innovation in terms of store design and what we have planned. That will be for future calls. But we do believe strongly that this is the prudent thing to do at this time to slow down the U.S. growth. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Colin Guheen with Cowen. ", "Colin Guheen - Cowen & Company", "A quick question -- on the international investment, as you increase the number of stores, is there any change in where you are investing in company-owned stores? Any markets that are getting extra stores?", "Peter J. Bocian", "No, I think for the next three years, the major company-operated markets will be Canada, U.K., China, and then Japan is a big market that is a licensed partner. So no real dramatic change in where the investment in -- if we looked Canada and the U.K., we\u2019ve talked about before probably 30%, 40% built out of what we think is the potential, so we\u2019ll continue to invest in those countries stepping through the horizon, but no dramatic change, though you do see five points higher license content, so there will be some movement between company-owned and licensed over time. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Mark Greenberg with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Greenberg - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you. Back to the research question, I\u2019m wondering looking either just exclusively at research or perhaps broadening out to deteriorating financial metrics, is there anything that you would see from a data standpoint that would cause you to think that perhaps store saturation and competition were responsible for some of the decline in comp store sales. And if that were the case, would you begin again to redress your store plans, specifically actually cutting the overall store base?", "Howard Schultz", "Well, there is no evidence based on the research that we just completed that the issue is based on competition, which I\u2019ve already stated. So I can\u2019t speak to the hypothetical because it doesn\u2019t exist. ", "What we view right now is something I\u2019ve been saying since my return as CEO and it\u2019s not with arrogance or hubris -- this is about Starbucks. This is about our ability to create excitement and demand in our stores and do the things that we\u2019ve always done really well that unfortunately we haven\u2019t done all that well over the last year, year-and-a-half. But the experience that we create in our stores has been the brand. We don\u2019t believe that when we are at our best that we are second to anyone and we are going to get back to doing what we have always done well, and that is create a differentiation in the marketplace around coffee, the coffee experience, and innovation. ", "So we don\u2019t view the competitive landscape or what you cited about saturation as the issue. The primary issue that we are facing, which we have not faced before, and that\u2019s new, is the fact that this downturn in the economy, unlike anything else that we have experienced before, in which we have been able to manage through other downturns and economic cycles, this is one that has affected us and we are managing through it in the best way we can and we are not alone. We are a part of a lot of other retail companies and consumer brands that are facing similar things, and when we look at mid-single-digit negative traffic, although that\u2019s a number that we are not accustomed to and make no mistake about it, not satisfied with, in the landscape of other retailers we are faring much better than most. ", "Peter J. Bocian", "And the only thing I would add is that we are going to continue to look hard at the performance of the stores. When you look at the 100 that we\u2019ve talked about for this year in the U.S., that\u2019s way above historical trends in terms of what we\u2019ve been looking to close in a year, or looking at. And you couple that with the international discussion we\u2019ve had throughout the call, we\u2019ll continue to take a hard look at the store performance, trying to factor in the relative economic environment and the long-term viability of that store. ", "Howard Schultz", "I think we\u2019ll take one more question. ", "Operator", "Our final question is from the line of David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS", "Howard, just to beat on this horse a little bit longer, the Starbucks same-store sales has been slowing more than what we see, for instance, in the casual dining segment, which one would think is a fairly discretionary occasion for the consumer. In fact, the same-store sales now trending worse than the entire industry so what I\u2019m wondering is, do you think -- and maybe you see a correlation with the type of stores, whether they are near shopping, is it the fact that perhaps you just -- your stores tend to get that type of traffic, that shopping traffic and that\u2019s what you are linking to the problem as much or more than $3.50 drink is too much for somebody at any one point. ", "Howard Schultz", "Let me try and answer this in a way that hopefully will relieve the concerns that you have. First and foremost, please make it crystal clear -- we are not satisfied with the down turn in traffic in our stores and we are working diligently to reverse that. We are not using the economy as an excuse but clearly the headwind of the economy has had a significant effect on our business. And you just have to look to South Florida and California. There is a direct correlation in terms of the downturn in our business and the acuteness of the compression in traffic in those markets, and specifically those markets are the ones that have been most drastically affected by the sub-prime mortgage issue. ", "Conversely, if you look at the Northeast, New England and New York, where we are continuing to have strong comp-store sales, those are markets that have not been affected. And then if you look at the landscape of traditional retailers, not casual dining. We\u2019re not in a casual dining business, nor do I think that\u2019s a good correlation. If you look at the high-end retailers or premium brands that are retailing product, whether it\u2019s Coach, Nordstrom, Crate and Barrel, Williams-Sonoma -- if you look at those numbers, many of those businesses are at negative double-digit comps. So where we are looking at so much data as a company and trying to understand where we fit into all this, we don\u2019t have empirical analysis but we strongly believe it is not the competition. The research strongly suggests that. We don\u2019t believe that we\u2019ve saturated the market but we do believe that we have a headwind the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen. It\u2019s not short-term in nature. There\u2019s a deep concern that the consumer has and we are being affected by the fact that Starbucks Coffee and a premium coffee experience has over time been an affordable luxury and at this time, it isn\u2019t for some people and they are cutting out the occasion or are less frequent, and that\u2019s why we are bringing the kind of innovation we are to address multiple need states, multiple day parts, and new categories that are exactly what our customers have told us in terms of health and wellness, energy, and a new product that we are pretty excited about that doesn\u2019t exist in the U.S. ", "And I\u2019ll also say that this is just the beginning of the innovation. We haven\u2019t talked about a lot of things that are going to come in calendar \u201909. ", "With that, we\u2019ll conclude the call and I\u2019ll just give it to JoAnn to close this. ", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thanks, Howard. Thank you for joining us today. That does close out our second quarter earnings conference call and we hope you\u2019ll join us on Wednesday, July 30th when we announce our Q3 earnings and have our call that afternoon as well.

Howard.", "Howard Schultz", "", "Before I provide an overview of the quarter and fiscal 2008, I would like to take a step back for a moment.  10 months ago as we reported our first quarter results for fiscal 2008, I detailed an extensive and ambitious plan to transform the company.  We were beginning to feel the headwind of the slowing economy, but we were determined to take the necessary steps to position Starbucks for continued growth.", "Today, after taking those difficult, but necessary steps, I speak to you with a renewed sense of optimism about our ability to succeed in fiscal 2009 and beyond.  We have rearchitected our cost structure which will allow for operating margin expansion.  We have a significantly healthier portfolio focused on geographies and locations with the best opportunity for growth.  We are taking steps on value and loyalty to reward customers which is clearly a critical area in this difficult economy.", "We have maintained an intense focus on strengthening our core business, particularly our coffee leadership and we have a leadership team and store partners who are reenergized and galvanized toward a common purpose.  This year of transition is over.  ", "The steps we took in fiscal 2008 have given us a line of sight and the flexibility to drive EPS expansion even in this uncertain operating environment.  As I speak to you today I am confident that we are on the correct course for these challenging times.  We are doing what I believe to be right, retaining our core customers, providing value in a way that is meaningful to our customers, investing in our people and our culture and being relentlessly decisive on both consumer facing initiatives and on cost control.", "With the foundation of a world class brand and continued customer loyalty, Starbucks can and will weather the current economic storm by staying the course.  During today\u2019s call I will give you an update on the progress we have made against our transformation initiatives in Q4 and for this fiscal year as well as a look at what we have planned or fiscal \u201909.  ", "Pete will then take you through detailed fourth quarter and full year results as well as the impact from the current macroeconomic environment on our business.  Finally, Troy will provide an outlook for fiscal \u201909 and then we will wrap up.  With that overview what we would like to cover, let me emphasis that while are go to market strategy has positioned us well for fiscal \u201909 we are continuing to make bold moves and tough decisions toward transforming our business for the long term.  ", "We firmly believe that decision we have made in the last 10 months and the strong management team we built during that time will deliver significant long term opportunities for our business and our shareholders.  Like other retailers we continue to face a very difficult economic environment both in the US and abroad.  ", "We have a similar view to other companies in that it remains unclear how long and how deep this downturn will be.  However I feel confident about our position for three main reasons.  First, we felt the effects of the downturn early and we have been preparing for this uncertainty for some time.  The store closures and deductions in force have been tough but necessary to continue to be very conscious of our spending and cost efficiency opportunities.  ", "Second, recent retail results indicate that we may be faring better than many other high-end retailers suggesting the changes we have made to date are having some impact.  Other premium retailers have seen double digit reclines in both comps and traffic in October.  ", "Third, we have very clear visibility into the decisions we must make going forward to ensure that we are well positioned for continued difficult economy as well as for when the economy begins to improve.  We are prepared to adjust expenses as needed as we move into fiscal \u201909.  We are particularly attuned to highly creative and relatively low cost quick turn opportunities to drive traffic in our stores, as you saw just last week on Election Day.", "Incidentally, through a combination of a single paid broadcast spot on the second highest rated Saturday Night Live in over a decade and aggressive viral marketing and PR campaign we were able to reach 150 million consumers with our offer.  According to brand index last week, Starbucks positive buzz rating jumped from 25% on October 31st, to 51% on November 5th, a significant shift for a one day promotion.", "I would like to now provide a high level overview of our fourth quarter and full fiscal year end results and Pete will fill in the details in his own remarks.  There were 132 net new store openings for the quarter, 1,669 net openings for the full year, significantly less than a year ago.  We ended fiscal 2008 with 16,680 stores globally.  Consolidated net revenues were $2.5 billion for Q4, up 3% year-over-year, $10.4 billion for the full fiscal year up 10% year-over-year.  ", "Operating income was $14.2 million in Q4, operating income for the quarter reflects $99 million in restructuring charges associated with decisions to close approximately 600 US and 61 Australian underperforming company operated stores and reduce non store headcount.  Operating income was $504 million for fiscal \u201908 including approximately $267 million dollars in restructuring charges.", "Earnings per share for Q4 were $0.01 which included $0.09 related to restructuring charges and transformation strategy related actions for the full year.  EPS was $0.43 including $0.28 relating to restructuring charges and transformation strategy related actions.  Pete will provide more detail including a link to non-GAAP EPS in his remarks.", "The company also generated $1.3 billion in operating cash flow in fiscal \u201908.  As I mentioned earlier we begin fiscal \u201908 by developing a transformation plan to position us for long term growth.  Our focus was three fold, strengthening the core business, elevating the customer experience and investing in and growing the business profitably.  As we turn the page on fiscal \u201908, a year of transition and transformation is over and we are well into the implementation phase of our strategy.", "Pete will discuss the details around the decisions that have led to a healthier store portfolio.  As I said over the last few months, we have made tough decisions in fiscal \u201908 over store closures, streamlining our leadership structure and non-store organization as well as doing the work necessary to reduce our capital allocation for fiscal \u201909.  In addition, we took steps to improve efficiencies in our store operations.", "We took on some cost in fiscal \u201908 associated with our core renovations that will play out as efficiencies in \u201909 and beyond.  We also began some work, which will carry over into fiscal \u201909 around improving efficiencies in our supply chain organization which will benefit our stores and our backend cost structure as well.", "In fiscal \u201908 we increased focus on coffee and our partners.  Our root coffee efforts with pie plate roast have shown particular traction in both the Northeast and New England which are strong brewed coffee markets.  We reengineered our entire brewed coffee offering to include freshness and quality by bringing back fresh grinding in the stores and shortening holding times.  This has resulted in shared growth in the away from home brewed category as well as improvement in our customer taste satisfaction scores.", "In addition, we trained our partners in espresso excellence pulling the perfect shot, steaming milk and customizing beverages to order.  This too has resulted in improved quality satisfaction.  Further, early customer reception to both Clover, now in over 50 stores, and Mastrena now in 1,500 stores have been encouraging.  These investments have been extremely well received by our partners and coffee enthusiasts as we deliver a thoughtful deployment plan in fiscal \u201908.", "We made our first entry into the health and wellness product offerings by launching Vivanno nourishing blends and by introducing new healthy food platforms including perfect oatmeal.  Amidst challenging difficult traffic realities you saw food attachment and ticket increase with the launch of this new healthy food platform and have seen it sustained as we move beyond the initial promotion.", "We are encouraged by these results and health and wellness will continue to be a focus in \u201909 and beyond.  At the same time we fully understand that food and beverage innovation alone is not the sole path to traffic incrementality.  The economy put increasing pressure on consumer spending over the course of the year.  We tested and implemented a multi tiered value strategy in fiscal \u201908 with a plan to apply what we learned to develop a unique and brand appropriate value offering for Starbucks in fiscal \u201909.", "We launched a new core value platform entitled Starbucks Card Rewards and dramatically increased our base of registered card holders which is now over 5 million customers.  As one of the top requests on www.mystarbucksidea.com we believe we have tapped into a big customer need for Starbucks and are providing valuable benefits to these customers.", "While we are still in the early days we are seeing encouraging results the most compelling being that we have an incremental $70 million versus this time last year loaded onto cards and ready to be spent in the coming months ahead.  This speaks volumes about the loyalty of our customers, the relevancy of the Starbuck\u2019s experience and their commitment to us.  ", "We also challenged ourselves to find meaningful and differentiated limited time offers to address soft spots in our business.  This led to the treat receipt offer which produced incremental afternoon comp traffic during the summer months.  As we entered the year we tested a new value platform, the Starbucks Gold Card, more on that in a few minutes.  ", "The bottom line is that we\u2019ve learned that we can provide a more value or our customers in a way that still delivers the quintessential Starbucks experience and we will apply this learning in ways that build on our brand and customer engagement in fiscal \u201909.  Just as we did last week with our traffic driving, Election Day brewed coffee offering.  ", "As you may know we brought our North American leadership team to New Orleans two weeks ago.  This was a significant investment in what has differentiated Starbucks over these many years, our store partners.  Given that approximately 85% of Starbucks revenues come from our retail stores, the leadership conference was a crucial investment in our partners, our customers and in our company.", "In New Orleans we asked our store managers and the broader leadership team to step up and to be accountable and personally be responsible or every aspect of their respective business.  We are providing the tools and the technology to enable them to manage their stores in a way that optimizes resources, applies real time data and supports effective planning and we introduced a new incentive program to award higher performing stores.", "We also outlined commitments to deliver against a reinvigorated brand platform called Starbucks Shared Planet.  We believe this socially responsible approach to our business will pay off with customers around the globe who want to do business with companies dedicated to doing the right thing and companies that they trust.  Starbucks Shared Planet is a comprehensive long term strategy of differentiation.  ", "The renewed focus on global responsibility is critical to our brand and our core value to many of our customers in key markets like North America and the UK.  Our recent announcement with fair trade and ongoing work with conservation international and key coffee growing regions around the world will continue to build a defining industry position around our coffee buying and our sustainability efforts.", "We plan to tell this story aggressively with our partners in the NGO community.  By doubling our purchases of fair trade certified coffee and becoming the largest seller of fair trade coffee in the world we increase relevance with our partners and our customers.  In addition to being the right thing to do, a significant body of research suggests that consumers care about socially conscious brands and support companies that are pursuing responsible business.", "We left the conference galvanized, focused and determined as ever to enhance and preserve the culture and values of the company with the renewed focus on customer experience and personal accountability.  I firmly believe that we have made the right investment to ensure the long term health of our brand and that the investment will continue to pay off as our partners take specific actions to improve store performance.", "Over the past few weeks, signs of improving comps have appeared episodically, though it is too early to call a trend particularly with the important holiday period still in front of us.  That said, October did not show further deterioration to comps or traffic, a possible indicator that Q4 may have represented a bottom coming out milestone for our company.", "A revised US growth strategy focuses less on adding stores and more on building the business within existing stores by prioritizing profitability and the customer experience.  Store closures proceeding on pace with plan and as a store portfolio evolves we remain focused on the resulting efficiencies.  ", "As we had projected, we have seen traffic increase in stores that are near proximity to closed stores.  We opened stores in the US during the quarter, but only in locations that are best positioned to deliver a strong return on capital and shareholder value.", "Let me talk a little bit about international.  As US downturn has spread to Europe and beyond we have been seeing weakness in some overseas markets.  That said we expect our international growth strategy which relies heavily on the licensed store model, will continue to contribute to grow in fiscal \u201909.  ", "During fiscal \u201909 we entered two new markets, the Czech Republic and Argentina.  We recently opened our first store in Portugal.  These openings have been wonderfully received in these countries and we continue to expand the global reach of our packaged coffee, tea and ready to drink products in international markets.", "Asia in particular has exceeded expectations for our consumer packaged goods offerings.  We have also gained strong support of our ready to drink products of key retailers in Mexico.  In Switzerland we launched packaged coffee in 200 grocery stores.  The first time our packaged coffee has been available outside of our retail stores in Continental Europe.", "As I alluded to earlier, we began fiscal \u201909 in a stronger position than we did in 2008.  Our operational structure and store footprint along with a solid and well thought out product and promotional calendar will allow us to successfully navigate the economic crisis and emerge as a stronger more efficient company.", "We are taking a different approach to the holidays this year and preserving our Christmas launch until we have had an opportunity to celebrate Thanksgiving.  With that in mind we introduced our new Thanksgiving blend coffee created in conjunction with restaurateur and celebrity Chef Tom Douglas.", "This new blend gave us the opportunity to showcase the culinary aspects of coffee and once again differentiate Starbucks.  The response to Thanksgiving blend is ahead of our projections.  Our Election Day free coffee offer spurred significant sales of Thanksgiving Day blend and we are on track to sell out of our inventory prior to Thanksgiving.  ", "Later this month we will launch what I believe to be the most relevant holiday lineup in our history.  While all retailers are in for a tough holiday season we are competitive offerings at a variety attractive price points with a view towards maintaining strong margins.  We are also offering customers a new reason to buy our special holiday beverages beginning on Black Friday, the day following Thanksgiving, through our partnership with Product Red and its founder, Bono.", "The Red partnership, part of Starbucks Shared Planet, will create awareness and we believe drive significant trial.  This is yet another way in which we are connecting with our customers and differentiating ourselves at a time when values mean more than ever before.  In these economic times we are keenly aware of the increasing importance of value to our customers.  The work we did in fiscal \u201908 to identify value options that resonating with our customers will continue to play out in fiscal \u201909.", "The enthusiastic response to our special Starbucks card offering through Costco bodes well for our holiday season.  We expect the millions of cards sold to begin generating traffic even after the holidays are over.  The Starbucks Gold Card which we have officially launched this week was thoughtfully and carefully planned.  ", "Gold Card holders receive a 10% discount on all store purchases, free WiFi and exclusive offers and discounts.  Annual Gold Card membership costs are $25.  We saw promising results when the program soft launched in October and last week when we launched in stores we outperformed our initial ambitious projections by five fold.  ", "We believe this is the kind of value that customers expect from Starbucks and we are extremely optimistic about the program.  We\u2019re being disciplined in our approach to value to ensure that discounts do not erode our premium brand and the position that we occupy while remaining responsive to the uncertain consumer environment.  We also remain focused on programs that we believe can increase sales while balancing any impact on margins.", "In terms of competition, we are keenly aware of the competitive environment which is why we\u2019re so focused on leveraging the heritage and differentiation of our brand as well as the opportunity to provide value in a way that is consistent with how we do business.  We offer the finest ethically sourced and roasted coffee in the world as well as a unique experience that has defined the specialty coffee business. ", "So, when fast food companies try to compare their coffee to one of dozens high quality coffee varieties that we offer, we believe our customers know better.  Our customer base is different and there is less overlap than people might believe.  In any case, because of the actions we took in fiscal \u201908 including our new cost structure, we are better positioned to win in a competitive market than ever before.", "So, while we continue to face challenges in the current operating environment, we accomplished many things in fiscal \u201908 which strengthened our business and our model and put us in a stronger position to help us weather these unprecedented times.  Because we took action early we enter fiscal \u201909 with a rearchitected cost structure, a much healthier store portfolio, a firm grasp on how to deliver value in a brand appropriate way, a strength and leadership team in our core, our product, our coffee and a team that at all levels is ready to deliver against this plan.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Pete who will review our Q4 and full year results.  Before I do that I want to just take a moment to thank Pete for his many contributions to Starbucks.  Pete is leaving the company later this month to join HP.  After Pete\u2019s remarks we\u2019ll hear from our new CFO Troy Alstead.  Troy started with Starbucks in 1992 prior to our IPO and has contributed greatly in a range of finance and operational roles.  ", "He was the finalist for the CFO role when Michael [Casey] retired and we\u2019re lucky to have him ready to step in and continue the work that Pete and the leadership team have done over the past year.  Troy has worked closely with me over the years and I look forward to his partnership.  Both Troy and members of our management team look forward to seeing you at the analyst conference in New York in early December.", "Peter Bocian ", "Howard provided you with a recap of a number of the strategic initiatives and actions we took in 2008 to strengthen the business.  In my time today I\u2019ll provide additional details on our fourth quarter performance which included executing on a number of strategic actions.  I\u2019ll then recap 2008 fiscal full year results and provide an overview of how we look as we enter 2009.   Then Troy will provide you our more detailed view for fiscal 2009.", "With the challenging operating environment as a backdrop, we continue to focus on implementing the transformation initiatives we laid out this past fiscal year.  In the fourth quarter we closed about 200 of the 600 US company operated stores that we had identified in Q3 as underperforming based on a detail review.  We also closed 61 company operated stores in Australia and reduced our leadership and non-retail staff levels by about 1,000 positions.  ", "I characterize these actions in two categories: first, we acknowledged that some real estate decisions made during the last few years were not good investments and took action; second, we saw a slower growth trajectory going forward and better aligned our cost structure.  Let me now provide you with a closer look at total company fourth quarter results.  We reported a 3% increase in consolidated revenues for the quarter to $2.5 billion from $2.4 billion a year ago.", "This was short of our expectations entering the quarter and was driven by continuing deterioration in same store comps.  As a note, this miss also showed up in operating income and EPS for Q4 which I\u2019ll discuss later.  Comparable store sales weakened further in Q4 driven both by declining traffic in our US business and a decline in average value per transaction.   We also saw deterioration in international primarily in the UK.", "For the quarter consolidated same store sales declined 7% of which 4% was due to less traffic and roughly 3% from a decline in average ticket.  The US performance in Q4 was weaker than we had anticipated entering the quarter and what we had guided on the Q3 call.  We believe the overall comp deterioration was directly linked to a worsening economic environment both in the US and in the UK.  ", "We reported consolidated pre-tax operating income of $14 million in Q4 which included $105 million of restructuring charges and other transformation strategy costs.  This compared to $248 million of reported operating income in the prior year.  Consolidated operating margin was .6% compared to 10.2% for the same period a year ago.  390 basis points of margin compression were due to the restructuring charges with the balance primarily due to sales deleverage.  ", "Earnings per share was $0.01 for the fourth quarter compared to $0.21 per share for prior year fourth quarter.  Fourth quarter EPS was negatively impacted by roughly $0.09 of restructuring charges and other transformation costs.  If we disaggregate the $0.09 nearly $0.05 is linked to charges associated with the announced closures of underperforming stores including asset write offs, lease exit costs and severance charges.", "Nearly all of the remaining $0.04 reflects actions taken to downsize our corporate support resources both in terms of facilities and staffing levels as part of the transformation initiatives designed to re-architect the cost structure of our business.  Let me now move to results for our operating segments beginning with our US business.  Total net revenues for the quarter increased by 1% to $1.88 million from $1.86 billion a year ago.", "Company operated retail revenues declined slightly to $1.7 billion for the quarter primarily due to negative comparable store sales of 8% which offset the revenue growth from 445 net new company operated retail stores opened in the last 12 months.  With respect to comparable store sales both traffic and ticket weakened sequentially from Q3 with Q4 showing a 5% year-on-year drop in traffic and a 3% decline in the average value per transaction.", "The year-over-year decrease in ticket was primarily the result of our de-emphasis in \u201908 of merchandise and music inventory in our stores.  US cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues increased to 45.3% compared to 41.7% in the comparable period a year ago.  Of this increase three quarters or 270 basis points came from cost of sales.  ", "The cost increase was due to three main factors: inventory adjustments related to the reduction of brewing equipment and other merchandise in our store all consistent with returning our focus to coffee as our core; expenses associated with our enhanced espresso excellence standards; new beverage innovation introduced in the quarter; and from higher distribution expenses from the expansion and migration of our distribution centers as well as higher fuel costs.", "Increases in occupancy related expenses as percent of revenue in Q4 were primarily due to loss sales leverage.  As a note the 205 store closures completed in the quarter did not yet have a material favorable impact on occupancy costs as many of the closing occurred late in the quarter.  US store operating expenses as a percentage of related US retail revenues increased 390 basis points to 46.1%.  About three quarters of the increase was the result of deleverage from softer sales.  ", "Also contributing to the rise in store operating expenses were increased marketing expenditures due primarily to new product launches.  US operating income was $51 million during the quarter down from $225 million during the same period in fiscal \u201907.  The operating margin declined at 2.7% of related revenues from 12.1% a year ago.  Sale deleverage was the leading contributor to the margin compression along with the cost items I just mentioned.  ", "Also included in the US segment results was about $43 million in restructuring charges which contributed one quarter of the margin decline.  Now, for a review of results from our international segment; international total net revenues increased 13% to $534 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201908.  Company operated retail revenues increased 12% to $446 million mainly due to the opening of 236 new company operated retail stores in the last 12 months.  ", "Comparable store sales were flat for the quarter reflecting further softening of the trends we talked about at the end of Q3.  With the domestic financial crisis spreading globally as the quarter played out the effects were particularly notable in our two key markets: the UK; and Canada which represent nearly 80% of our international same store sales.  International operating income decreased to $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201908 compared to $51 million a year ago.", "Operating margin for the fourth quarter was .5% compared to 10.8% a year ago.  In addition to softer sales margin compression primarily resulted from higher cost of sales and occupancy resulting from costs associated with the expansion of our centralized distribution system and higher fuel costs and $19.2 million in restructuring charges we reported for the quarter related to the 61 store closures in Australia.  ", "Now, let me move on to results from our third business segment, the global consumer products group or CPG.  CPG total net revenues declined 4% to $105 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 namely due to lower revenues from packaged coffee sales in the US market.  Operating income for CPG was $63 million in the fourth quarter compared to $62 million in the same period a year ago.  The operating margin expanded 340 basis points to 60.3% of related revenues.  ", "The different movement between revenue and income was primarily due to the mix of revenue being less weighted towards the initial sale of coffee and tea products to Starbucks distributor which have related costs of sales and more towards revenue profit sharing earned on the distributor sales to retailers which helped drive the margin expansion.  Now, for a few comments on Starbucks\u2019 balance sheet and liquidity.  ", "Starbucks is in a good financial position with a strong business model to generate cash in excess of our investment needs.  We also had the capacity for up to $1 billion in short term borrowings either through our credit facility, through our commercial paper program or a combination of both.  At fiscal year end the company had $271 million available for short term borrowings.  ", "A note on the recent amendment to our credit facility, this was directly related to adjusting for the near term accounting impact of lease termination costs associated with the 600 US company operated stores designated for closure.  The closures helped put us on a path to stronger credit ratios in the medium term as we boost operating cash flow and reduce rent.  The cost reduction initiatives we\u2019ve completed around staffing and real estate along with a slower store expansion target will help offset the impact from the sales deleverage we\u2019ve been experiencing putting Starbucks in a better position to generate higher free cash flow going forward.", "As a final note on the amendment, even though lease exit costs are now expected to be higher, we see little risk of breaching our coverage covenant.  The recent squeeze in the credit markets elicited a lot of questions from investors particularly near the end of the quarter related to our CP program and our ability to borrow so I thought it might be beneficial to remind you of the $1 billion in aggregate credit capacity we have and in the event the company has difficultly placing CP we can elect to borrow against the credit facility.  ", "We ended the year with $1.3 billion in cash from operations.  Our capital investments for the year came in at $985 million which was below our target of $1 billion.  Of our fiscal 2008 cap ex, approximately 80% was in support of our stores with two thirds of that allocated to new stores, more than 20% to renovating and remodeling existing stores and 10% represents investment in new equipment such as the Mastrena and warming ovens to name a few.  ", "The remaining 20% of the total $985 million spend was primarily investment in our supply chain and for IT systems projects.  Overall, capital expenditures in 2008 represented about 9% of revenues which is slightly lower than the past few years.  Let me now recap our fiscal 2008 performance by looking at a few key metrics.  Let me begin with store openings and net store counts.  In August of 2007 when we initially provided our 2008 store opening target we were planning to open 2,600 net new stores globally.", "As the economic environment continued to weakened and as we entered 2008 we lowered our store opening target for the year and for 2009 through 2011.  As the year progressed and the economic pressures mounted we conducted a thorough review and analysis of our entire US company operated store portfolio.  From that effort came the decision to close approximately 600 company operated stores and significantly slow our store growth in to the near future.  ", "We ended with fiscal 2008 with 883 or less than half the net new US store openings compared to fiscal 2007 including 60% fewer company operated and nearly 40% fewer licensed net openings than prior year.  We also evaluated our international company operated store portfolio and one underperforming market stood out, Australia.  We made the decision to significantly downsize our presence in that market by closing 61 stores while retaining 23 profitable stores in three key metro areas.", "Total net new international store openings in fiscal 2008 were relatively flat with fiscal \u201907 at 786 stores with more than two thirds of the growth coming from licensed stores.  Now, shifting to comparable store sales, overall they were down 3% primarily driven by the US segments decline in traffic.  The US business same store comps were a -5% for the year with slightly more than a 4% decline in traffic and less than 1% from lower average value per transaction.  ", "As the year progressed we began to feel the impact of a weaker global economy reflected in softer international comps.  We finished the year with 2% international comparable store sales growth driven primarily by the increase in the average value per transaction.  The slowdown in revenue growth for the year of 10% was the result of a combination of negative same store comps and fewer net new company operated stores.", "Fiscal 2008 earnings per share came in at $0.43.  When we factor in the approximately $0.28 attributed to restructuring and transformation related costs, non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 per share down from the $0.87 GAAP EPS we achieved in fiscal \u201907.  At negative 3% comps, non-GAAP EPS eroded by 18%.  As Troy will talk about shortly the new costs architecture for 2009 is very different as we expect to get very significant EPS expansion if comps in \u201909 are similar to 2008. ", "The last point on EPS, to provide better clarity in to the $0.28 delta between reported GAAP and non-GAAP EPS let me walk you through the specific P&L line items impacted by the roughly $339 million in restructuring charges and transformation related expenses.  Of that total $267 million or roughly $0.22 of EPS was directly attributed to restructuring charges and the remaining $72 million specifically to other transformation strategy initiatives.", "The $267 million in restructuring charges break down as follows:  about 80% represented charges related to the approximately 600 US store closures and 6% to the 61 Australia store closures.  The majority of the remaining amounts related to reducing our corporate real estate footprint and was assigned to our unallocated corporate segment.  The majority of the $72 million in transformation related charges about 90% was in store operating expenses with more than 80% of that in the US segment.", "These costs were primarily related to debt side costs and overhead write offs associated with the reduction in new store openings.  To recap our view of the year, recognizing the difficult operating environment in its early stages we focused on restructuring our business to build a cost structure to support the business for the long term.  We took action to close 600 underperforming stores in the US which should not only improve profits in the near term but also give nearby stores a boost in sales from transfers to existing stores.", "After a number of efforts to improve the performance in our Australia market over the past few years, we made the decision to close 61 stores retaining 23 healthy stores in that market and we rationalized our leadership structure and non-store organization by eliminating approximately 1,000 open and filled positions, nearly 15% of non-store positions globally and better aligned around the global ownership of functions which should give us leverage and efficiency going forward.", "We ended 2008 with a healthier store portfolio, a more aligned cost structure to allow for operating margin expansion at lower comp levels and with a solid business that generated $1.3 billion in operating cash flow.  Now, let me turn the call over to Troy to talk about 2009.", "Troy Alstead \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "As Howard mentioned earlier with the transitional year now behind us we are confident that Starbucks enters fiscal 2009 fundamentally stronger and better positioned to grow earnings and improve operating margins in the year ahead.  Historically our business model has been highly dependent on strong same stores sales growth to drive the kind of earnings growth that Starbucks had delivered.  ", "This past year Pete has tried to more clearly illustrate for you the link between comparable stores sales results and our ability to achieve certain EPS targets.  While we will continue our efforts to boost same store sales, we have the opportunity to take some of the pressure off that metric by prudently rationalizing our cost structure and the steps we took in fiscal \u201908 have put us in a much better position to deliver solid EPS growth in fiscal \u201909 even if same store sales are negative.", "Clearly, our goal is to deliver positive comp growth but it\u2019s important to note that the model is no longer as reliant on achieving that.  If we began with fiscal 2008 non-GAAP EPS of $0.71 as our base line, we believe that the range of FY 2009 EPS growth we can deliver keeping in mind that we are comping over -3% in same store sales in \u201908 if we have -2% comps in fiscal \u201909 we believe that we can still drive more than 25% EPS growth and hit $0.90 non-GAAP earnings per share.", "We believe that even a negative -5% comp could still deliver non-GAAP EPS of around $0.80 or greater than a healthy 10% growth year-over-year.  If we look at how we started the first few weeks of this fiscal year and if average transaction volumes remained similar for the balance of the year we would still expect to deliver 20% EPS growth.  Also factored in to our fiscal \u201909 EPS expectation is the $200 million to $210 million in the pre-tax positive benefit or $0.17 to $0.18 of EPS from the US company operated store closures, restructuring of Australia and cost savings from the leadership and non-store organization changes we made this past year.", "I want to remind you that fiscal \u201909 EPS on a GAAP basis will still be impacted by the lease exit and severance cost from the US and Australia store closures that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201908 and will continue in to fiscal \u201909.  We now expect an impact of up to $0.12 per share in fiscal \u201909 related to lease exit costs.  ", "As we look to the start of fiscal 2009 the first quarter will also be impacted by the investment we made in our field organization through the field conference held in late October which we estimate will impact Q1 EPS by roughly $0.03.  Keep in mind that our first fiscal quarter is also expected to be the toughest comparable period year-over-year.  ", "Let me now provide a comment on anticipated cost inputs for \u201909.  We currently expect the impact from our higher green coffee costs to be offset by favorable dairy this fiscal year.  Further, at our latest projection for foreign exchange rates we do expect an unfavorable impact to EPS of approximately $0.02.  These commodities and fx impacts are already reflected in the comments we\u2019ve made today regarding our expectations for delivering improved operating margins and earnings growth in 2009.", "What I want to leave you with here is that there\u2019s a better opportunity than there\u2019s ever been in the past for our model to drive EPS growth without as much dependency on same store sales growth.  That equates to a much healthier and sustainable model especially in challenging economic cycles.  For store openings in the US we\u2019re now targeting -20 net new stores in fiscal 2009 which includes a nearly 225 company operated store decline and approximately $205 licensed net new stores.  ", "In response to the global economic downturn and our cautious approach to expansion in this current environment, Starbucks is now planning to open approximately 700 net new stores in international markets during fiscal \u201909 two thirds of which we expect to be licensed.  As we factor in the current global economic climate with a continued particularly cautious approach in the UK and western Europe.  ", "Total net revenues are expected to be relatively flat with fiscal 2008 with variations around that of course driven by the level of comps we deliver.  We expect modest operating margin improvement for the total company as well as for both the US and international business segments for the full year.  The company is further reducing its projected capital expenditures to $700 million, adjusting for the revised international store opening target.", "Cap ex allocated specifically for our stores is targeted at around 70% of that total with more than half of that earmarked for renovations and remodels as well as new equipment to support our enhanced quality standards and expanded offerings.  Capital expense towards new stores is a much smaller portion compared to previous years as we shift investment priorities towards enhancing the quality of our existing store base.", "The remaining 30% of the total $700 million is designated for investment in IT systems and in our supply chain.  Our capital expenditure target for 2009 represents about 7% of revenues significantly lower than in previous years.  We expect cash flows from operations to be essentially flat with the fiscal 2008 level of $1.3 billion.  Improvements in operating income are expected to be offset by cash outflows related to lease exit costs.  ", "With our healthy operating cash flow we expect to substantially pay down our short term debt during the year and we do not anticipate any share repurchases.  In closing, we\u2019ve taken the difficult and necessary actions to position Starbucks for the challenging environment we face.  Our cost structure has been re-architected and is now more appropriately scaled to the size and growth of our business.  We\u2019ve taken actions on underperforming stores in the US and reduced new store growth resulting in a much healthier store portfolio.", "Our most troubled international market has been significantly downsized removing sizeable operating losses from the P&L.  We enter 2009 with a number of actions underway to drive greater efficiencies in our store operations and our supply chain.  Our business continues to generate healthy operating cash flow at the same time we have been very careful on capital spending and continue to be in 2009 and we have refocused our efforts on the core of the Starbucks experience in our stores while driving profitable innovation and meaningful value to customers.", "These efforts we believe will enable us to improve operating margins and grow EPS in 2009 despite the challenging global economic environment.  Now, let me turn the call back to Howard for his closing comments.  ", "Howard Schultz ", "Before we turn to Q&A I just thought I\u2019d like to frame what you\u2019ve heard today.  I think there are really two distinct stories, first a year of transition with the associated expenses required to transform a company and a quarter with higher than expected attrition and continued restructuring costs.  That first story is complete.", "The second story and the one I would like you to focus on is about the future.   With the right cost structure, vastly improved consumer offerings tied to value and quality and a reenergized team Starbucks is poised to drive EPS growth for fiscal \u201909.  We know what we need to do, we spent a year rebuilding and we are faring well in view of these challenging economic times.  Now, is the time for us to execute and that is exactly what we plan to do.", "JoAnne DeGrande", "", "Operator, let\u2019s move to Q&A please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Steven Kron \u2013 Goldman Sachs.  Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "I actually just have one bookkeeping question first, on same store sales if you could just give us what the traffic was in 2Q and 3Q, I think you gave us a little more detail this time around in the fourth quarter? Then also there is some comment about the first quarter how it started, I missed that in my notes if you could just repeat that.  ", "Operator", "", "We lost the caller.  Our next question comes from Steven Kron \u2013 Goldman Sachs.  ", "Steven Kron \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I guess as it relates to the guidance, I guess just taking a step back for a second basically what you guys are implying here is despite a negative 2% comp and backing out the $0.18 that you\u2019re going to get from these transformational strategies that you\u2019re still not going to see deleverage in the model?  And I guess you mentioned a couple of times in store efficiencies and supply chain efficiencies, is that where you\u2019re going to get these benefits to offset the -2% comp deleverage?   If so, please drill down and talk to us a little bit about what specifically is there.", "Peter Bocian ", "Let me answer the previous question about Q3, Q4 sequential and then Troy will do the Q1 and then talk about the guidance for \u201909.  We had -8% comps in the US in Q4, we had -5% in Q3 so sequentially we were down a little more than three points, some of that in traffic but a big part of it in the average value of the ticket which I mentioned was around the merchandise and the music in the stores.  So, we did have a deterioration Q3 to Q4.  ", "I had mentioned on the Q3 call that we would get to a mid 70s kind of EPS if comps stayed relatively flat; they didn\u2019t.  So, Q4 went down.  Troy, maybe you could talk about what we\u2019ve seen so far in Q1 and then kind of the guidance question from Stephen.  ", "Troy Alstead \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "What Howard had said about Q1 is encouraging to us is that we\u2019ve not seen so far in these early weeks of the first quarter a deterioration of comps which is what we are think we\u2019re hearing from any other premium brands and retailers.  We\u2019ve seen some optimistic movements from days to days, nothing to predict a trend yet but that\u2019s been encouraging so far to us and we\u2019ve not seen that deterioration so that\u2019s our specific comment about Q1 comps so far.", "Then with respect to how we\u2019re going to do it in \u201909, I\u2019ll tell you it is a wide ranging set of things around efficiencies at our store level but not only there, all throughout our supply chain, procurement, our distribution networks.  In the stores it\u2019s a number of things from waste management to lean efforts within our stores to how we lay out the bar so the efforts are easier for partners.  It\u2019s an entire range of things that are underway today some of which we\u2019re already beginning to see the fruits of, some which will pay out as we continue to focus on them throughout the year.", "I think the thing I\u2019d expand on here is that Howard and Pete throughout the year and this leadership team have taken the actions around the transformation agenda some of which were one time efforts to readjust our cost structure to where it needs to be but one of the benefits coming in to \u201909 that we continue to focus on is a relentless pursuit of doing everything we do better and that\u2019s at the store level it\u2019s in our supply chain, it\u2019s in the support center building here and I think you\u2019ll see that in the leadership team highly focused and as we go through  this year that\u2019s the new spirit, the new process and the new set of systems we have in place.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Lawrence Miller \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", "Lawrence Miller \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I wanted to ask a little bit about that ticket being down 3%.  It sounded like you talked about music and equipment driving that and what might that mean as we head in to the holiday season?  Can you give a little more color?", "Howard Schultz ", "I think that\u2019s an important question because personally I\u2019ve been more focused on the transaction and the traffic number than the overall comp especially in Q4 it was somewhat artificial as it relates to comparing it to a year ago.  The music business has been significantly downsized and we also had a fairly robust brewing sale in Q4 a year ago which we didn\u2019t have this year.  So, the traffic number is what I\u2019ve been focusing on.", "In terms of on a go forward basis, what we\u2019ve done for holiday and I think we were very early to do it is we completely revamped all of the holiday merchandise to reflect price points that we thought would out question be perceived as tremendous value for our customers.  So, the overall price points in holiday merchandise on the hard good side has a lower ticket price than a year ago with virtually the same margins.  ", "So, we feel like we\u2019re in a good position to execute against holiday with the same level of retained gross margin and there could be some attrition on ticket.  But then to offset that we are seeing a higher level of attachment on food to those people who have been buying beverages because of the success of oatmeal and the other healthy products.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "I\u2019ll actually get right to the point, the remodel campaign that you guys talked about are 20% of your cap ex going towards your remodels, it sounds like a larger number than I think you\u2019ve done in the past.  Can you talk about some of the things that are included in that?  What type of test you may have done with respect to that and what type of comp lift you might see?  Or, is that directed towards comps or cost reductions?", "Troy Alstead \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "There\u2019s a routine remodel program that we have in our store base as stores reach the five year market and generally the 10 year mark and those remodels are about refreshing the stores.  It\u2019s actually for the most part built in to our initial pro forma for each store that we build is an assumption that we will spend capital roughly at the five year market and again at the 10 year mark to renovate the store, to refresh it, to bring it current with our current standards. ", "So, what you see over the last year and in to \u201909 is some increase of that which is just to a large extent a natural aging of our store population.  Arthur Rubinfield, our President of Global Investment might want to add a little bit to that.", "Arthur I. Rubinfield ", "That\u2019s basically how we handle our pro forma and move forward in our renovation strategy, just like you were saying.", "Peter Bocian ", "", "The other thing I would kind of add is I think before we kind of have had two buckets around store cap ex.  We said it\u2019s either new or its renovation.  What we tried to do is break out where we\u2019re actually investing in equipment for the store and I broke that out on the $985 million of cap ex this year so the renovation piece \u2013 we actually talk about three buckets going forward because the warming and the Mastrena is actually a sizeable investment as well but you had the renovation piece right.  It reflects just the natural ramp in the store portfolio and the respective age.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I wanted to go back to the question that I didn\u2019t fully get the answer to on the margin improvement despite negative comps.  Two quarters ago you thought you could earning $0.90 with let\u2019s call it 2% or 3% positive comps.  Now, you\u2019re saying you can earn that amount with -2% or -3% comps.  Can you maybe break it down in to what you think you save at the store level, what is coming out of the corporate expenses or are there other areas maybe we haven\u2019t thought about in terms of benefits to deleveraging or tax rate benefits or something else that also contribute to that formula?", "Howard Schultz ", "I\u2019ll just start briefly with a brief comment and then I\u2019ll go back to Pete and Troy.  It think it\u2019s important to just take a step back and understand that the entire year with regard to transforming the company.  So much of that has been an assault and focus on things that we have not looked at in the past and that was at the growth of the company and success and double digit comps in a sense covered up these things and gave us the air cover not to have to address it or not to address it as intently as the disciplined we\u2019ve had now.", "The discipline, the focus and the relentless pursuit of efficiency and saving money at the backend, those things that are not consumer facing has given us the encouragement and the optimism to make the statements we\u2019ve made today and then Pete can get in to the specificity of that. ", "Peter Bocian ", "I think if you remember the last call at Q3 we were talking about the $0.90 to $1 and needing two to three points of positive comps to get to that and so I say it wasn\u2019t the $0.90 it was more the middle of the range.  But, that\u2019s said, it\u2019s correct to recognize that we\u2019ve gone after more costs than was there in Q3 and that covers in store operations, supply chain, procurement, store development based on for example a new international store number, etc.", "So, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything but we have gone after more costs around rearchitecting since we talked to you last at the end of Q3.", "Howard Schultz ", "And, I think we did that with the anticipation that we began to believe that fiscal and calendar \u201909 would be at least as bad in terms of the economic pressure and the consumer confidence and we had to do things before the year ended to put us in a position to win in \u201909 and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.  ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Howard, could you talk generally about the marketing and advertising opportunity and given the success of the recent election day promotion are you looking at becoming more aggressive on media advertising as a means to drive traffic going forward?", "Howard Schultz ", "Well, I think as you know we have not been a traditionally spender of classic marketing and consumer facing activities that have been associated with most consumer brands.  I think as we look back on last week we did something last week that I think is very interesting to try and get underneath and understand with the question of how do you leverage this on a go forward basis.  ", "But, I think what it showed was that we were able to make a very small relative investment in terms of buying a spot on national TV and running it once and leveraging new media, the digital world, the viral community the [blogosphere] and PR in a way that really very few brands can do but because of the cultural relevance of Starbucks on national footprint and the fact that we were part of the national dialog on election day gave us an opportunity to do that.  ", "We drove significant, and I mean significant incremental traffic in to our stores with impressions on a day that was really valuable to us because of Thanksgiving coffee and the launch of Gold Card.  We believe that there are other opportunities to do that.  I don\u2019t think we want to milk it but I think we want to be very disciplined and thoughtful about it.  Then, at the same time I think in view of the economy and consumer confidence, we want to be extremely thoughtful about how we\u2019re going to spend marketing dollars on a go forward basis.", "But, I think in this environment the rules of engagement no longer apply and what I mean by that specifically is I think our number one activity has to be to maintain our core customers and ignite our base and I think with Gold Card and that kind of promotion and the things we\u2019re doing around value we\u2019ve been able to that.  I think when you look at the way which our brand sits today, the relevancy of the sense of community that we have in our stores, that really did resonate with our customers and the public at large and we\u2019ll look at other opportunities to do that.  It was very clever, very smart and very cost efficient. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley \u2013 Banc of America Securities.", "Joseph Buckley \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "I have two questions, one is a follow up again, just to clarify the comments on October, Troy when you were running through the scenarios of -2% comp can give you 25% EPS growth or $0.90 and -5% comps gives you $0.80 did you say something to the effect that if the first few weeks of \u201909 is sustained that you would have 20% EPS growth?  If I heard right, what are you trying to imply by that.  ", "Then a question on Starbucks Gold, the fact that you\u2019re off to such a great start does it make you nervous that you\u2019re selling it to your best customers and then in effect discounting to your best customers?", "Troy Alstead \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "I\u2019ll start with the first question, you\u2019re correct what I was saying about the first several weeks of October and this is not a prediction by the way it\u2019s an illustration but, if we take transaction volumes as we see them today, and this is after a year of the negative comps we had and volumes lower than they\u2019ve been historically and just flat laying those over the rest of the year again, not predicting that\u2019s what would happen but to illustrate how the year goes, that would we believe give us the ability to drive 20% earnings growth still in 2009.", "The point here is that 2008 deteriorated throughout the year so even at today\u2019s lower volumes than we\u2019ve had historically as we play that out over the course of \u201909 comp growth doesn\u2019t continue as negative in a percentage basis as it did in Q4 and that\u2019s the point I was making for you.", "Peter Bocian ", "Just to add to that, if you look to the comps we saw in 2008 the first quarter was fairly flattish so that\u2019s what the October comp number or Q1 against the probably the last good quarter we had in 2008.  Then, it was -5% to -8% in the US as it went through the year so it\u2019s comping against a different number after Q1 it went down in Q2 through Q4.  ", "Howard Schultz ", "In terms of your other question about the Starbucks Gold card, in many ways fiscal \u201908 was a year of learning with regard to value and value testing and driving a number of regional tests in different markets.  In those tests I think we came away with the conclusion that if we provide unique value to our customers that really resonates with them, we will see a higher degree of frequency and perhaps even a higher average ticket.", "So, I think this is a opportunity for us to reward loyal customers.  It\u2019s a great opportunity between now and the first of the year for this to be a fantastic valued gift because the research strong suggests that a gift card of Starbucks, whatever face value it has, has a much higher value in terms of the connotation of the recipient.  ", "I believe between that and the millions of cards that we\u2019ve sold to Costco will drive traffic in to our stores at a time when the cost of acquiring a customer for others is much, much higher than the cost of acquiring a customer in this kind of thing that we\u2019re doing with both the Gold Card and Costco for us.", "Then lastly, what we\u2019ve always seen as a result of the gift card and we believe we\u2019ll see it in spades with both the Costco gift card and the Gold Card is an annuity that comes after the first of the year which will bode well for calendar \u201909.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from John Ivankoe \u2013 J.P. Morgan.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Again, just a housekeeping question and then one other, Pete I think it was in your comments that you talked about the 270 basis point decline just on the COS side in the US and much of that due to inventory write down.  Could you quantify that in both the fourth quarter and the full year 2008 and whether you think any of that will recur in 2009?  That\u2019s the first question and then I\u2019ll ask another one if I may as well.", "Peter Bocian ", "I think we tried to break out as much as possible the movements within the company.  I think when you think of the inventory adjustments, would not expect to recur.  When you talk about the espresso excellence standards I would say that we learned in 2008 so we introduced it, we implemented it but I think we\u2019re going to go back in store operations and find a more cost effective way to deliver the same standard.", "The other point I mentioned, so that one I think is an opportunity for us so that would have been in the P&L for pretty much three quarters.  The last one was really around the introduction of the new platforms in the quarter.  So, I think we will get also get better at some of the new platforms relative to procurement and cost of sales going forward on some of the beverage innovations we saw.  ", "It\u2019s all baked in to what Troy described relative to let\u2019s call it the sensitivities of EPS that we think we can achieve.  So, probably the only unique one is the inventory adjustments.  The other ones we\u2019re working on as part of our improvement plan to deliver better operating margin in 2009.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeffery Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Jeffery Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Actually just one clarification and then a question as well, just on the clarification side Troy I just want to make sure on [inaudible] a little earlier I think you had said in your ranges that if comps were down like 5% you\u2019d be looking at 10% plus EPS growth for around $0.80.  I just want to clarify that you\u2019re not saying if comps were to remain where they are now which is probably running in the down 7% range that you could deliver greater earnings growth than that.", "I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s some sort of quarterly mix shift that you\u2019re referring to?  Then in terms of my question, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about the international side having a greater benefit from being primarily licensed and offering less volatility therefore.  I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the US business?  I know going forward you\u2019re talking about opening a lot more licensed stores versus company operated but if you could look back at your existing stores base already, might you consider a shift of stores from company to license?", "I think in the past you\u2019ve kind of pushed that off a little but it seems that growth is slow in the US and now might be the time to consider shifting towards the license model for your existing stores in the US?", "Troy Alstead \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "I\u2019ll take the first question first here and I\u2019m going to read part of this over again because I\u2019m going to be very clear on what we\u2019re saying about what we expect could happen under various comp growth scenarios in 2009.  We believe that if we have -2% comps in fiscal \u201909 we can still drive more than 25% EPS growth and hit the $0.90 non-GAAP earnings per share.  ", "Further, we believe that even if comp growth ends up being -5% we could still deliver non-GAAP EPS of around $0.80 which is greater than 10% growth.  Those are the two sort of metrics that I spoke to.  I went further than to say if you start with what we\u2019re seeing in transaction volumes in our stores right now in the first several weeks of the year, again much lower than we\u2019ve had in the past because of our negative comp growth over the course of 2008 and then as an illustration extend that out, those same volumes over the course of 2009 even under that scenario we believe we will deliver roughly 20% earnings per share growth.", "That was attempting to give you a sense of the actions we\u2019ve taken and how we believe it protects us in this range of negative comp gross to still produce operating margin improvement and earnings growth over the course of 2009.", "Peter Bocian ", "On your second question, if you look at what we are planning to do for 2009 you can see that we\u2019ve still got the 400 store closures to impact the net number, we\u2019re planning probably about 175 very carefully picked net new stores in the US and then the license store number in the US is a little over 200 which was in the release.  So, there is at least in \u201909 more license coming out in the US than new company operated and that will continue to be the case for international where we have kind of a two thirds one third ratio.", "JoAnne DeGrande", "", "We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "", "Our last question comes from David Palmer \u2013 UBS.", "David Palmer \u2013 UBS", "This question is on innovation, Howard you wanted to cut through the bureaucracy and increase the effectiveness and turnaround time on the innovation.  I\u2019m just curious about could you give us some examples of how your innovation process is perhaps changing?  How involved are you personally in the product introduction choices?  And, what have you learned or what has Starbucks learned about innovation year-to-date the [inaudible] in this environment about what works and perhaps what doesn\u2019t work?", "Howard Schultz ", "I\u2019ve said in the past that I thought that in the early entrepreneurial years of our company the creative spirit and how that related to innovation was one of our core strengths and with the specifics of the facts that we were able to be extremely nimble and go to market very quickly.  As the company has grown and the scale of the operation, it becomes harder and harder to respond quicker to opportunities and get it to market in a timely fashion just because of the backroom issues of [inaudible] operations, product selections. ", "If you just take Vivanno as an example, we rushed Vivanno to market but then we had to find regional suppliers for bananas for thousands of stores.  You would think that would be an easy thing to solve for but when the banana supplier heard the order on a daily basis he almost had a heart attack.  It\u2019s that kind of thing.", "But, to put it in to precise terms, first and foremost innovation, creativity and our ability to create separation in the market place with regard to differentiating products and platforms is really key to the future.  I am intimately involved in all aspects of that from the ground up.  I also think what I\u2019ve learned is the following, is that in this environment it\u2019s very, very important to be decisive but you\u2019re not going to have perfect information.", "I think it\u2019s important in view of that to have the courage to go to market without perfect information but realizing that there\u2019s going to be issues that perhaps you have to solve on the fly.  I also think it\u2019s really important to maintain your core customers and do everything you can to ignite your base.  But please don\u2019t make any mistake about innovation, the success of the company in the past and today and in the future is reliant on our ability to lead with regard to coffee.", "The coffee experience, how we go to market with coffee, the aspect of sustainability and what we talked about today with regard to fair trade is that the innovation in terms of other platforms are complimentary to the experience.  I also think we have to innovate with our people and provide them new ways to participate in the success of the company as we did in New Orleans.  ", "I think this is a time at Starbucks where nobody wants to go through something like this but having gone through this year we are a much, much stronger organization for having gone through it with a galvanized common purpose and the optimism and enthusiasm that we have as a company has never been higher about the purpose that we have, the willingness to drive innovation and most importantly to exceed the expectations of the customers.  ", "We think we are better positioned to win today than we were a year ago when we were just beginning to face the downturn in the economy, the strong headwinds.  We got after it early and I think we are in a position to win in fiscal \u201909 despite the economic condition.", "JoAnne DeGrande", "", "That brings our fourth quarter and year-end earnings call to a close for today.

My name is [Jennifer] and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Starbucks Coffee Company second quarter fiscal 2009 conference call. (Operator Instructions)", "Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations at Starbucks Coffee Company. With me today are Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO, and Troy Alstead, CFO. Q&A will follow today's prepared remarks.", "Before we get started I'd like to remind you that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements and risk factors discussed in the filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. ", "Please refer to the Investor Relations section of Starbucks' website at www.Starbucks.com to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. ", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn, and good afternoon, everyone.", "Let me start by saying that shortly after my return as CEO I instructed our leadership team to scrutinize all aspects of our business and operations and to wring out savings and efficiencies wherever possible. They did just that. As a result, I can report that over the last year we have identified and are in the process of implementing over $500 million of permanent reductions in our cost structure in fiscal '09. ", "Importantly, these changes have not come at the expense of the Starbucks customer experience. These are permanent changes that reflect more disciplined management and better store unit economics. The changes will remain part of our organization and culture and will pay off even more as the economy improves. And at midyear we are ahead of plan on our cost saving efforts.", "During the second quarter we began to see early signs of progress, particularly in our U.S. business, in terms of operating margin. We are also seeing some signs of sequential improvement over Q1 in terms of consumer sentiment and traffic in our U.S. company operated stores, but I think it's still too early to call it a trend. The global economy continues to be weak and we are conservative in our view of any significant recovery in '09, particularly in light of rising unemployment, foreclosures and other key economic indicators. ", "In addition to solid progress on cost saving initiatives, we have seen top line improvements. We are beginning to gain traction from our efforts to strengthen the business for both the short term and the future. Although same-store comps are still in negative territory and we are working hard to reverse this, we have seen the trend improve slightly in the second quarter and we are confident as we continue to set the stage for long-term growth through innovation and channel diversification as well as international expansion.", "Consolidated net revenues were $2.3 billion in Q2, down 7.6% year-over-year. Comp store sales were negative 8%. ", "Earnings per share for Q2 were $0.03 after a $0.13 impact from restructuring charges and non-GAAP EPS was $0.16 per share. ", "At our recent annual meeting I made it clear that one of our major initiatives for 2009 and beyond is the introduction of Starbucks VIA, our entry into the $17 billion instant coffee category, a global category devoid of innovation for decades. We believe Starbucks VIA can elevate and re-invent in this space by creating a new category - super premium instant coffee\u00a0- leveraging the power of the Starbucks brand with a patent-pending technology innovation. ", "And since the initial limited launch in March in Seattle, Chicago and London, as well as distribution through our website, we've now experienced heavy demand and continued positive reviews from customers and the media. We have since expanded the distribution of VIA to select Barnes & Noble stores, Costco stores and Target locations in Seattle and Chicago markets, and I can now tell you that VIA has so far exceeded expectations in all of these channels. Last week we announced that VIA will now be offered on easyJet, the U.K.'s largest airline. ", "We think this highlights the appeal of VIA for the on-the-go occasions and there are many more of these opportunities for us to pursue. In fact, the early success of VIA has encouraged us to expand on our original distribution plans to incorporate additional channels and markets for fiscal year 2010. In addition, we are going to broaden the line beyond the two existing SKUs of Italian Roast and Columbian coffee and we'll be talking more about this over the next few months.", "As the effects of the global economic crisis continue to proliferate, consumers want to feel good about every hard-earned dollar they spend and we certainly understand that. To that end, we focused heavily on providing value in the second quarter and will continue to do so in a way that is consistent with our brand and values and communicated through the Starbucks lens. ", "We introduced breakfast pairings in the U.S. at a national price point of $3.95. Customers responded positively to our pairings and we've seen an increase in food attachment during this period. In fact, our internal research indicates customer perceptions on affordability and value for money have been positively impacted by this new initiative. As a result, we're going to continue the pairings promotion as part of our ongoing value strategy. ", "In addition, launched in November, the Starbucks Gold Card program now has over 700,000 loyal Starbucks Gold Card customers who visit us every other day and on average are buying 15% more per visit than the average customer. The Starbucks card experienced a 7% increase in money loaded over the same quarter last year. We loaded $250 million on Starbucks cards in Q2 and have increased registration of our cards by over 150% over last year to nearly 1\u00a0million. This is really important in that registration enhances our ability to communicate directly with our customers and we're certainly going to use that to our advantage.", "And success of the Starbucks card is not isolated to the U.S. The Starbucks card was launched in Korea last month and in the U.K. we introduced the rewards program to the existing card just this week. In both markets we've seen a great response, underscoring the powerful and unique asset that we have in our card program, both domestically and in our international markets.", "Turning to CPG, building on our successful launch of packaged coffee in the grocery channel in Switzerland, we expanded into select stores in France and Germany, and we have an opportunity to continue to expand outside of the U.S. ", "Our international business remains a very important growth opportunity for Starbucks. Three weeks ago, after several years of seeking the right strategic partner and the right locations, we opened our first store in Poland, our 50th country. The coffeehouse segment is one of the fastest growing of the dynamic culinary sector in Poland. Lines on opening day rarely dipped between 15 to 20 people deep and daily transactions for the first three days were among the highest we've seen in any Starbucks opening day anywhere. This performance, combined with the early success we've now seen in Russia, Romania, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, demonstrates the growing opportunity that we have in Eastern Europe. However, we continue to watch our international business closely given the ongoing financial crisis and currency issues. ", "In terms of competition, speculation that Starbucks is losing retail market share to competitors has been grossly exaggerated. It should be no surprise that a category leader like Starbucks would be a target for others wanting to take share. However, we've looked at markets where competitors have tested heavy coffee advertising and one thing remains apparent - our customers are not trading down. We are aware that the noise level is going to increase and we're prepared for that. ", "Let me give this point a little bit more context. The historical perspective suggests that greater awareness and education leads consumers to trade up to better quality and a better experience. We understand that mass marketing advertising can lead to trial; however, we also know that consumers will reject offerings that do not meet their expectations. So our view is that increased visibility to brewed coffee and espresso beverages plays to the long-term strength and our advantage - higher quality coffee and certainly a better experience.", "In terms of our own marketing, we know that customers are looking for meaningful value, not just a lower price but quality and the values that come with it. We have a great story to tell on this front and in the coming days we're going to arm our consumers and our partners with the facts about Starbucks coffee and our company - we will launch a long-term, multi-million dollar campaign focused on the quality, value and the values that Starbucks offers. And I should point out that we have been preparing this campaign for some time and it is baked into our financial plan. ", "The campaign will build over time and take full advantage of multiple channels, both traditional and non-traditional, supporting all of our distribution points in our business. It will also be a validation to our customers and our partners of what Starbucks is all about - exceptional coffee, a unique experience, and the values that have built our brand from the very beginning. This is key to driving more occasions from existing customers and attracting new customers to Starbucks. I want to stress that the investment we are making is long term and we are confident that our voice and our message will break through with our current and future customers. We'll have more to say on this in the days ahead. ", "In the next few months we will remain focused on providing value for our customers reflecting the continued relevance of our brand as consumer behavior shifts. Beginning May 5th Starbucks will offer a grande iced coffee for less than $2. This will be our next move to celebrate the quality of our coffee and extend value to our customers in a relevant way. ", "It is critically important that we also balance providing value to our customers with tightly managing our margins. To that end we will be fine tuning our pricing in several key markets to better reflect geographic, cost of goods and labor considerations. As a result, there will be minor changes that will lower prices on some of our more popular items such as tall lattes and slightly increase prices on our larger and more complex beverages. ", "Creating value while remaining a premium brand with a premium experience is something Starbucks can do because of the emotional connection and the reservoir of trust that we have with our customers. This connection is very much tied to the sense of community in our stores that we create and the humanity around Starbucks values. ", "As we open new stores - certainly on a smaller scale at this time in a more strategic fashion\u00a0- we will continue to elevate that experience. Our customers will see subtle changes in our stores, including a streamlined menu board and focused product offerings. Also as part of this overall effort we are continuously evaluating pricing, labor productivity, waste reduction, work flow and inventory analysis. These will not only enhance the customer experience but will also contribute to overall significant cost savings and greater efficiencies for the company.", "We are encouraged by the momentum of our business and the decisions we've made along the way that are now beginning to gain traction. As we continue to driver greater efficiencies at the store level, we will also take full advantage of a host of opportunities for top and bottom line growth.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Troy.", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone.", "As you heard from Howard, we are very encouraged by some positive trends in our second quarter performance. While there are not many meaningful positive indicators in the economy which would change our outlook for the balance of the year, we are pleased to see our efforts to date paying off in overall improvement within our P&L, which is something we can control amidst this very uncertain and challenging operating environment. ", "Several months ago we established and began executing against a plan to restructure the company to drive efficiencies in margin improvement to move the business toward a more sustainable model, one that is far less reliant on top line growth to drive profitability. Our second quarter results reflect a significant step in that direction.", "Let me begin my review of Starbucks second quarter performance with an overview of results for the total company. For the second quarter we reported consolidated revenues of $2.3\u00a0billion, an 8% decline from $2.5 billion a year ago which was driven by the 8% decline in comparable store sales in the quarter. As you would expect with fewer new stores contributing to revenue, the decline in overall revenue mirrored the decline in comps. Same-store sales were comprised of a 5% decrease in traffic and a 3% decline in the average value per transaction. ", "We reported consolidated operating income of $41 million in the second quarter, which includes $152 million of restructuring charges. Excluding those charges, non-GAAP operating income was $193 million compared to $178 million of reported operating income in the prior year and $213\u00a0million on a non-GAAP basis in the prior year, excluding the $35 million of transformation-related charges incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. ", "Restructuring charges in the second quarter of this fiscal year were driven by asset impairments and lease exit and other costs associated with store closures, valuation adjustments on corporate office facilities that are no longer intended to be occupied by the company, and the February non-retail work force reduction. ", "Consolidated operating margin was 1.8% and was 8.3% on a non-GAAP basis, nearly flat with the 8.4% non-GAAP margin from a year ago, reflecting solid progress in our efforts to tightly manage our cost structure. ", "Earnings per share was $0.03 for the second quarter net of approximately $0.13 of restructuring charges. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.16 compared with non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 a year ago. ", "Let me now review results for our operating segments, beginning with our U.S. business. In doing so, I will shift to discussing results on a non-GAAP basis. ", "The majority of our restructuring efforts and charges have applied to our U.S. business and the U.S. business is where we are seeing the earliest signs of progress. Non-GAAP operating margin in the U.S. segment was 10.9% in the second quarter compared to 11.5% in the second quarter of 2008. And of note, operating margin in Q2 improved sequentially by 20 basis points from the first quarter of the fiscal year when excluding the 130 basis point impact from Starbucks leadership conference in the first quarter. While we did not see improvement in consumer spending during the second quarter, we are pleased to have the U.S. business back in double-digit operating margin. ", "Total U.S. net revenues for the quarter decreased by 7% to $1.8 billion from $1.9 billion a year ago. Company operated retail revenues declined 7% to $1.6 billion for the quarter primarily due to an 8% decline in comparable store sales. The 8% decline was driven by a 5% decrease in traffic and a 3% decline in the average value per transaction.", "As a percentage of total U.S. revenues, U.S. cost of sales including occupancy costs increased 90 basis points to 42.3% compared to 41.4% in the comparable period a year ago. The fixed-cost nature of occupancy felt the effect of ongoing deleverage. Cost of sales was impacted by higher beverage and food costs associated with new product innovation such as Vivanno, tea lattes, additional warmed items and oatmeal. Higher coffee costs also contributed to the increase. We did experience favorable dairy costs in the quarter, both from lower commodity costs and from our own efforts to reduce waste, yet this wasn't enough to offset the other rising costs in the business. ", "We demonstrated early progress in our disciplined management of store operating costs. U.S. store operating expenses as a percentage of related U.S. retail revenues were 42.7%, nearly flat with the 42.5% last year on a non-GAAP basis despite the 8% decline in same-store sales. We are now benefiting from the positive effect of tighter expense controls and from cost savings initiatives directed at optimizing labor hours in our stores. However, impairment charges for retail stores and equipment were 40 basis points higher in the current quarter compared to the prior year, which offset some of that favorability.", "Moving now to results from our international segment, international total net revenues declined 12% to $434 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, almost entirely driven by foreign currency impact due to the stronger U.S. dollar compared with the British pound and Canadian dollar. Also contributing to the revenue decline was a 3% decrease in comparable store sales, unchanged from the first quarter, which was comprised of a 2% decline in traffic and a 1% decrease in ticket. This was once again driven by softness in the U.K. and Canada, by far the major components of international same-store sales. ", "Non-GAAP international operating income declined 18% to $20.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to $25.4 million a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin was 4.8% or 30\u00a0basis points off of last year's second quarter non-GAAP margin of 5.1%, in part reflecting deleverage from the decline in same-store sales. ", "Moving now to results from the global consumer products group or CPG, CPG total net revenues declined 2% to $95 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 due to increased discounting and lower sales volumes in the U.S. packaged coffee channel stemming from heightened competitive activity driven by the challenging economic environment. We believe our U.S. consumer product segment has experienced a lagged effect from the economic downturn as it took longer for consumers to demonstrate price sensitivity in grocery and warehouse channels than in our retail stores. Competitors in CPG channels are aggressively competing for market share, which has led to increased discounting. We are working closely with Kraft, our distribution partner, to address this situation and we have full intention of retaining our leadership position. ", "Operating income for CPG was $45 million in the second quarter compared to $43 million in the same period a year ago. The operating margin was 47.8% of related revenues compared with 44.3% for the prior year period. Last year's second quarter margin was unusually low due to the impact of weaker income from equity investees resulting from product write-offs within the North American coffee partnership. ", "Now for a few comments on Starbucks balance sheet and liquidity. ", "Starbucks continues to remain in a very good financial position, generating solid operating cash flow and maintaining strong liquidity. In the first quarter - typically the highest cash generating period of our fiscal year - we took the opportunity to significant pay down our short-term debt. During the second quarter we further reduced our short-term borrowings from $290\u00a0million to $226\u00a0million at the end of the quarter. And as a reminder, some of our excess cash in fiscal 2009 has been and will continue to be used to fund the payment of restructuring costs related to store closures. ", "On last quarter's earnings call, despite reporting strong free cash flow generation, I alerted you to our intention to seek an amendment to our credit facility. This was driven by the lease termination costs associated with our decision to close another 300 underperforming stores, which we announced on that call as well. In light of the worsening economic conditions we were understandably cautious in our assumptions around store closure costs. ", "However, as we have progressed through the initial store closures, we've determined that the impact from lease exit costs on the balance of fiscal 2009 will be lower than we previously expected. Our projected cushion above our covenant levels is now in a position where we no longer expect to require an amendment to accommodate the restructuring charges associated with the closure of those additional 300\u00a0stores. As a result, I am pleased to report that we are no longer pursuing an amendment to address that issue. ", "Capital expenditures for the first six months were $237 million, less than half of the $505\u00a0million in CapEx a year ago. We are maintaining our fiscal 2009 CapEx forecast of $600 million, with a larger proportion of the spend falling in the second half of the year as is our typical pattern. Existing store renovations and other store investments, along with corporate projects, are the primary areas of investment. ", "For the first six months the business generated $715 million in cash from operations and $479\u00a0million in free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. At our annual meeting of shareholders last month I provided an outlook on where we expect to be at the end of fiscal 2009 in both of these measures and it's certainly worth repeating here today. As with each of the past three years, we expect to deliver cash from operations in excess of $1\u00a0billion this fiscal year and we expect free cash flow in fiscal 2009 to reach a record level for Starbucks exceeding half a billion dollars.", "I would now like to spend a few minutes providing an update on our progress toward the half billion in cost savings we've committed to achieving in fiscal '09. The strong momentum we had going into this quarter allowed us to deliver approximately $120 million in savings in the quarter, exceeding our $100 million target for Q2. For the remainder of fiscal 2009 we expect to deliver approximately $150 million in the third quarter and approximately $175 million in the fourth quarter. ", "There are basically four primary categories of cost reduction initiatives that we've laid out for you: ", "First, cost savings related to store closures in the U.S. and in international markets, which represents approximately one-fifth of the $500,000 million. This has been under way since Q4 of fiscal 2008 and will continue throughout this fiscal year. Fiscal year-to-date we've recognized approximately $35 million in savings from store closures.", "Second, decreasing support costs through headcount reduction in our corporate support areas and groups outside the retail structure along with downsizing our corporate facilities. This is the largest single component of our cost savings target, representing slightly more than one-third of the total. The first wave took place in late July of last year and the second in late February of this year. To date we've delivered approximately $80 million of the targeted $180 million in this category.", "Third, in-store cost savings opportunities in the areas of labor and waste reduction, which is around one-quarter of the total savings opportunity. These initiatives got under way last quarter and through year-to-date Q2 we have realized approximately $45 million in savings toward our $100\u00a0million goal. ", "And fourth, the remaining one-fifth is in our supply chain and will be realized through savings in procurement and in manufacturing and logistics. Work in this area began last quarter as well and we are making good progress to date toward achieving the $100 million we committed to savings in fiscal '09, delivering approximately $35 million year-to-date. ", "In total these add up to slightly more than $500 million in real and sustainable costs that we are stripping out of our P&L. Due to the staggered timing for completion of these initiatives throughout fiscal 2009 the impact to our cost structure has even greater potential in 2010 and beyond when the full year impact of these initiatives can be recognized. ", "Now looking ahead at the balance of the year, there hasn't been any discernable change in the external operating environment, therefore we do not yet have improved visibility to provide you with our outlook for the balance of fiscal '09. Yet there are a few key metrics that we have articulated and I will provide you with our current view on those.", "Given the current environment and because this year's net new store count is heavily influenced by the timing of closures, the numbers have and will continue to move around a bit as we work through this fiscal year. We now expect to add around 20 net new stores to our global store base this fiscal year, which includes a reduction of approximately 365 company operated stores and the opening of approximately 385 net new licensed stores. We have once again provided a detailed schedule of the targeted fiscal year end store counts in the earnings release. ", "Our planned capital expenditures remain unchanged at $600 million. The outlook on our two primary commodities - green coffee and dairy - has improved slightly from our previous view. We experienced a slight favorability in dairy in Q2 and expect that to continue for the balance of the year. We now expect coffee and dairy costs for the balance of the year to net to a favorable $0.02 per share versus the prior year. This net favorability in commodities is offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange in both Q2 and the balance of the year. We now expect foreign exchange to have a $0.03 unfavorable impact to EPS on the full year.", "Before we move on to Q&A I'd like to summarize the quarter. Starbucks second quarter performance demonstrates measurable progress toward our efforts to drive costs out of the business and improve efficiencies throughout the organization. We continue to navigate in a difficult external operating environment but remain focused on the initiatives we have under way. ", "In a business climate that makes top line growth very challenging, we are listening to our customers more than ever and have introduced and will be launching products that meet their needs for value and health and wellness. And while work at retaining our customers, we are equally committed to reshaping our business model to make it healthier and more resilient to external pressures. That was demonstrated in the second quarter by a return of our U.S. business segment to double-digit non-GAAP operating margin and by the total company's non-GAAP operating and net margins, which were essentially flat with the prior year. We are on track with our plan and our second quarter financial results reflect that progress.", "Let me now turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Glass - Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Can you talk about the fine tuning of pricing? What's the net effect of pricing? Is it neutral or, I presume, lower? Can you talk about that?", "And can you talk about how you plan on communicating those changes with the customer this summer as well as maybe how you plan on communicating things like $2 iced coffees? ", "Troy Alstead", "We have over many months conducted significant customer research as well as analysis on our price architecture and have put a great deal of rigor behind this. The research and analysis factors in a whole host of things, including geography, size preferences, costs and margins, as Howard spoke about earlier, and as a result we'll make those price adjustments to reflect learnings that came out of that research. Some prices on some products in some geographies will go down; some will go up. Also we'll make changes to our menu boards to better communicate our product offerings and our value.", "Let me be clear here, though - no one should conclude from this discussion today that Starbucks is taking a price increase nor should anyone conclude that we're taking a price decrease. This is a new elevation of the kind of analysis we do on pricing. It'll mean movement and adjustments in various places. It's based on rigorous analysis that leads to adjustments up and down. And we believe ultimately it's good for customers and overall on net it'll be good for the Starbucks P&L.", "Howard Schultz", "In terms of the iced coffee, the grande iced coffee, there'll be both internal as well as external communication that will, I think, provide our existing and new customers a level of awareness about both quality and value that's consistent with and which we believe will drive incremental traffic.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company, LLC.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company, LLC", "I guess I'm curious, you mentioned sizing so I'm wondering if we'll see some larger sizes for the cold beverages with this change? ", "And then also could you give us more of an idea of what the streamlining of the menu boards really entail?", "Howard Schultz", "We have no intention of going to larger sizes. We do not think that is consistent with the equity of the Starbucks brand and the experience. We do not want to go down the route of a QSR. That's not who we are; not who we want to be.", "In terms of streamlining the menu, you know, Troy mentioned the rigor in which we've gone after this. In terms of the research we've used some external resources that have a lot of capability and experience in this and we've concluded that by streamlining the menu there'll be a lot more clarity to the things that we do and I think as a result of that a lot more attachment with regard to the customer. You know, some of this we've put in front of customers already and we feel very good that there's an opportunity here that we haven't gone after in the past.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "A question on, I guess, the bundling of product at breakfast. Can you maybe give us a little bit of insight as to how the margins are tracking on that product and how you're comfortable that those that are purchasing that bundle and attaching food aren't those that would have otherwise been coming in to get that same product?", "And then just secondly, if I can, just, Howard, maybe a big picture question. There's been a lot of initiatives over the last six to 12 months to stimulate the top line, everything from loyalty cards to bundling of products to new food items, new beverage items like Vivanno and teas and such. Can you maybe just take a step back and talk to us a little bit about the progress of some of these things, whether they've performed up to where you thought they were and, in cases where they haven't, maybe what went wrong in the processing?", "Howard Schultz", "Okay. Troy, you want to go first?", "Troy Alstead", "Yes, I'll take the pairings question first, Steven. ", "We went into the breakfast pairings with a couple motivations. One was to provide value to customers at a time when they need it, at a time when the economy and the situation our customers are in requires that, and to provide that value communication supporting this strategy to our customers. And then, of course, another part of the motivation here was to drive food attach and overall create an attractive offer that we think in the long-term positions the company to drive increased traffic.", "Now it's early results, but I'll say the early results have been positive on both of those metrics. We have seen an increase in food attach since we launched the pairings and in our studies with consumers we've also seen that there's an improvement in the value perception they have of Starbucks, the quality they get and about it being worth the price, and that's an important measure for us and, again, accomplishing really a big part of what we've gone into with this. ", "So with a pairing there is a discount and so there's some percentage margin hit from that, but net-net on balance over time the equation we believe is a positive one in terms of increased food attach and, again, the value perception with customers. ", "So, so far so good and it's something we'll keep working on and will be a continued part of our launch as we go through the rest of this year. ", "Howard Schultz", "In terms of your second question, which I think is a good question and one that I'd like to address, first off, if you look at the history of Starbucks, maybe even going back, say, 5 years, 3\u00a0years or even longer than that, and you look at the number of products/promotions and initiatives we've had during that time, I think that there's a common thread to the level of innovation and creativity and kind of entrepreneurship that we've always had. ", "And if you compare that to what we've done, say, over the last 12 to 18 months, I think you'd be surprised, to kind of look like for like, we haven't had that many more product introductions or developments in category than we've had in the past. Perhaps we've put more emphasis on it and maybe we needed more out of it than we've had in the past, but there has been a common thread of innovation and new introductions for many, many years.", "I think that perhaps there's three segments of this. One is we're in a different environment than we ever have been and as a result of that we had to make big bets on value. And some of them are really paying off; the Gold Card is a fantastic example. The pairings are new for us, but as Troy just went through that, I think the most important thing is that the research strongly concludes that our customers are giving us higher marks in terms of value for their money.", "So we want to continue to invest in and introduce new opportunities to provide a value opportunity for our customers. ", "There's another area which is health and wellness where we've had two, I think, significant product opportunities - one is oatmeal and one is Vivanno. In both cases, oatmeal probably scoring higher in terms of visibility and attachment because everyone knows what oatmeal is and we had a great price point on that and it tastes great, that was a real homerun for the company and something we will continue with on an ongoing basis. ", "Vivanno is the beginning of what we need in Starbucks and that is a healthy alternative which, again, going back to internal research, our customers really want healthier food not only from Starbucks but in general, both for themselves and their kids. And Vivanno was the first attempt and one that we're going to continue with and you'll see more things from us with regard to Vivanno this summer.", "And I think the third area, going from value to health and wellness, is just our core. And I would define our core as coffee and recently as tea. But if you go back to Pike Place Roast, the initiation of Pike Place and what that did for the company, the level of attachment and, as we look back on that, we feel really good about the level of success we've had with Pike Place. And then most recently bringing that back as a featured whole bean coffee, it was one of the strongest initiatives we've had in terms of whole bean and ground coffee as a new varietal in our stores. And you'll also see that in broad-based distribution. ", "The tea I would say we thought we had an opportunity to really leverage our expertise and core competency in tea during the winter months and, candidly, we didn't see the level of success that we had hoped with that category. And I wouldn't say we're going to give up on that because we think obviously there's a big, big opportunity on an ongoing basis with iced tea that we've always played in and played well in and you'll see that again this summer. ", "But the thing that I think we have to keep going back to is that Starbucks has been and will continue to be not only a coffee company and a retailer but we have to be a merchant. And as a result of that we've got to create excitement and differentiation and value for our customers and we will continue to do that. ", "I would want the answer to not be linked to one thing that's really important which I touched on in my remarks and that is Starbucks VIA. VIA is, from everything that we can see and the visibility we have, which is only about 8 weeks old, we have tapped into something that is very, very large, with a very big prize. Having been to Seattle, Chicago and London myself and seen what's going on, we really have a unique opportunity and you're going to see us do something quite significant with VIA as the weeks and months go forward. ", "And this is a large category, ripe for innovation and, as I said in my remarks, devoid of any innovation maybe for 50 years. And when you look at the category in terms of 80% soluble in many parts of the world and the fact that we're changing behavior in the U.S. - and one of the most encouraging things in Seattle and Chicago is that many people started off buying the three-pack and now we see a huge shift in terms of percentages of people who are shifting from the three to the 12-pack because of repeat business. And we're tapping into something that we're pretty excited about. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David Palmer - UBS Investment Research.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Research", "Just two quick modeling questions. How much do you think the Costco gift card promotion impacted same-store traffic and check in the quarter and perhaps how did those net out in terms of sales?", "And also how much do you think that the slowdown in your store growth and the store closures in addition to that, how much did that help your same-store sales, if you've calculated that.", "Troy Alstead", "David, I'll try to tackle that, perhaps not at the level of depth you're going to want, but let me address it here.", "First of all with respect to Costco, but more broadly I'd speak about the card programs we've done in general which have, as Howard mentioned earlier, been part of our value strategy this year and so have been providing value through some discount to consumers, we talked about that last quarter and again in the second quarter. Part of our negative comp growth in ticket is related to discounts on the card because that's where just that discount component shows up as we're providing that value on to consumers. ", "That's not the single biggest driver, by the way, in the negative 3 comp growth we had in ticket, so just to try to put that into perspective for you; there's a number of other factors going on in ticket which we've talked about over the last couple quarters, importantly including our strategic decision to narrow and pull out more significantly in the hard lines, narrow our entertainment selection in store and some of the other merchandise offerings, which does not hurt us on the bottom line but reduces that average ticket until we move through that. So a few other things going on with ticket, just one piece of which is reflected in the discounts through Costco and our other card. So hopefully that gives you a little bit to work with. ", "", "And then in terms of closed stores I don't have a specific impact on comp to provide to you. What we have said before and I'll repeat again because we believe we're seeing a common trend here is that as we close stores we're seeing a roughly 20% of the sales from the closed store picked up at neighboring stores. And that ranges from next to nothing in real remote stores to a very, very big percentage in real dense market areas. But that's the plan we had going into this and that's what we're seeing is that sales transfer on those closed stores. ", "Now the timing of closures varies throughout the quarter and throughout the year, so it's a little bit difficult to isolate and pinpoint for you an exact comp number, but I think that'll give you some perspective.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jeffery Bernstein - Barclays Capital.", "Jeffery Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Two questions, one just on the sequential comps. I believe you alluded to earlier kind of early but you're saying that traffic trends through the quarter and into the third quarter, I guess you were seeing improvement within that number? I'm just wondering if you can give some color, both U.S. and international, whether there's anything regarding traffic, mix, day part, whatnot, that would support that. ", "Then perhaps on the international side I think you mentioned the U.K. and Canada. I don't know whether you saw some sequential further negativity or whether there were other markets in terms of trends, stabilization - looking for a little additional color.", "Howard Schultz", "Sure, Jeffery. First of all, the comments about feeling as if we perhaps are seeing some improvement was really relating to the second quarter. None of our comments should be applied at this point to anything about the third quarter. We're not commenting on that, being in the middle of the quarter that we are. ", "But as we went through the second quarter, while it's not much improvement, we were somewhat encouraged by the fact that comp growth in the U.S. is slightly better on that negative than we saw in Q1 and we are similarly encouraged by the fact that in our U.K. European markets and international in general, which Canada and the U.K. together are 75% of our international comp growth, that we've seen some stabilization there, that as we went through Q2 the comp growth there did not deteriorate further. ", "We've perhaps been concerned that some of those markets would head toward our U.S. levels and that has not happened, so that was what we were referring to when we said we had some encouragement. It is too early to call it a trend, but it's something we feel good about coming through the quarter.

I was just curious how you might see some of these value programs evolve? Maybe you can give us some color about the pairings because I think I've seen, instead of the tall coffee [inaudible] latte, and just how you think about it evolving.", "And then can you also juxtapose the value strategy with your thoughts on the long-term pricing power of the company?", "Howard Schultz", "Let me take the latter first off. I think we've been very clear from the very beginning with regard to value that we have to do value through the Starbucks lens. And I think that what that means is that we don't want to do anything that would in any way dilute the integrity of the experience, the pricing power of Starbucks, the premium experience and what people have come to expect from Starbucks.", "I think the art form - and I think we've demonstrated it with pairings - is that we can provide value. For under $4 the customer is getting real value in terms of food and coffee and at the same time customers are coming into Starbucks and spending $9, $10, $11 for a pound of coffee and they recognize that is the best coffee in the world. I think we're also doing a very good job of starting to kind of demystify the fact that Starbucks coffee does not cost $4, as people are charging us with. And you'll see us communicate that in much of the things that I've talked about in terms of the campaign. ", "So in view of value and what we're trying to do, we would give ourselves pretty good marks for entering the space of value, doing it our way, and at the same time maintaining the pricing power of the company based on the other things that we offer. ", "And I think the other thing that I would say - and it goes back to the research we've done - the customers recognize that the environment that we create and the value of the company are very important. They also recognize that if hey are trying something else in a fast food environment, they know it's not Starbucks coffee, it doesn't have the quality, and they know that they're compromising. And I think that's going to bode well for us in the future.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan.", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "The question is on your international business. As I look throughout the last several quarters, you've kind of been bouncing around in most quarters under the 5% number. Is there kind of a magic number that we should be focused on in the international business that we should expect that business to grow to?", "And do you think you might have an opportunity to restructure the international business further, such as what you did in Australia to improve margins by perhaps cutting more money losing stores or perhaps even entire markets?", "Troy Alstead", "John, I'll tackle the second part of that first.", "The Australia situation, where we closed 60 some stores out of 80 some in the market, was unique. We don't have any other markets in our international business that were as underperforming as Australia was. And we took the action to correct it and have been very pleased with the results since then.

We don't believe now, based on what we see in the health of that international portfolio, that we have more to close in that 100 that we've already announced, but it's just part of the ongoing analysis that we go through each quarter and each year with that business. ", "", "Now, speaking to the first part of your question, over the long term I have announced previously and will say again today that I firmly expect our international business to trend toward the mid-teens in operating margin over the longer term - by no means this year and by no means next year, but that's the target we've laid out and we can expect to see that as we grow that business overseas. ", "Part of the thing to consider and keep in mind internationally is that international's really not one business; it's a collection of 49 or 50 businesses, all of which are at various stages of development, of size, and take longer over time to develop and grow to the kinds of returns that we expect to see. But we have been pleased with our progress there. Where we've seen issues, such as Australia, we're fixing them. And we're very optimistic about the future and optimistic about all the growth we have ahead of us overseas internationally.", "Now to the ownership question, we always look at ownership. That's an ongoing analysis around should we own more of somewhere or own less of somewhere else? That's tricky internationally where we have some great partners who help us grow and development. That's really a constant evaluation we go through. There's nothing significant I see on the horizon that would change that structure from where it is today. As we continue to look at that business, we'll talk more about it as time goes on. But, again, nothing on the scale of what we did in Australia.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Joseph Buckley - BAS-ML.", "Joseph Buckley - BAS-ML", "A question on the Gold Card program. You gave a couple of interesting stats that sounded pretty positive. I guess I'm curious if you've been able to track Gold Card holders who were former Starbucks holders and see if you've got an increased frequency or a higher check from those customers?", "Troy Alstead", "We have seen - I think Howard might have had this in his prepared remarks - we do see higher average ticket in Gold Card customers who we've got history on, meaning they held the Gold Card before, we could watch their behavior, and now we can watch it after. So there is a higher ticket there and that's an important part of our success as we continue growing that.", "Howard Schultz", "To put that in perspective, Joe, when we launched the Gold Card program in November prior to Thanksgiving, I think we all thought that if perhaps we could get to 250,000, maybe 300,000 by year end that would be a victory. Certainly a lot of people on the outside who kind of guided us in said that would be as well. ", "We ended the first quarter close to 500,000 members. We're now over 700,000. We're still adding over 1,000 new Gold Card members a day who are paying $25 and this thing is, I think, a very valuable asset for the company in ways that I think we really haven't articulated yet in terms of mining the information, the value we have in communicating with our customers, ways in which we can surprise and delight them, and clearly the fact that they're coming more often and spending more at Starbucks and feel really valued and appreciated.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc..", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Howard, a question on the advertising strategy that you mentioned. Could you give us a flavor for what the overall message might be? ", "And, Troy, maybe perhaps directionally how much the level of the spending that you might do this year and in 2010?", "Howard Schultz", "I certainly appreciate the question. I'm not going to get into the specifics, but we're not that many days away from unveiling this. As I said in my remarks, we feel strongly that we have a great story to tell about the heritage of the company, the values of Starbucks, how we can bring value to our customers and clearly a differentiation in terms of quality and experience. And in addition to that we want to be able to certainly define the fact of what's true and what's not, so we will tell our story in our voice in our way.", "Troy Alstead", "And what I'll speak about the dollars is that, as I think we said earlier, it's a long-term campaign. It will be a multi-million dollar campaign. I'll also comment that in general our spend this year already reflects our expectations around what we're going to spend on this campaign. And our spend this year in this advertising area won't be significantly different than our history. We're spending our money, however, in a different way. So while this will be some big spend in this particular area, it won't significantly change how much we're spending on our P&L against this.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Matthew Difrisco - Oppenheimer & Co..", "Matthew Difrisco - Oppenheimer & Co.", "I just have a couple of questions with respect to the turnaround. Can you give us a couple of timelines or where we stand as far as I remember some of the more impactful things from your first presentation where you had the video of the store with less labor in it. Can you tell us how that - I think the term was slimming the labor costs or at least a more efficient-looking store humming around, less people in the back doing as much productivity - where do you stand as far as evolving some of the high-volume stores that you had targeted for that? ", "And also is Sorbettos still in the plans to be rolled out this summer? That was another item that was talked about. ", "And then also just as far as the overall health and wellness, being a different product lineup, is that going to be something that we could hopefully see some advertising behind so the non-coffee drinker can be educated on what is being sold in the store to try and drive and expand your demographic appeal?", "Howard Schultz", "That's a lot of questions. Let me give you Cliff Burrows, the President of Starbucks' U.S. business, to address your questions around the store effectiveness and what we've done around lean. ", "Cliff Burrows", "", "Just to say that the work we shared around optimizing the labor behind the bar, we are well on the way with evolving that. Some of it is in specific tasks that we're putting into our stores and streamlining that activity and that is the first part of our rollout of our lean work. And we continue to evolve the holistic view of operating our stores and each time we revise a store into a refurbishment or each time we're opening a new store we are planning that store, equipment layouts and labor deployment, in line with lean principles. So directionally, yes, we're heading that way and we are very pleased with the progress, and that is indeed underpinning the labor savings that Troy was referring to earlier. ", "Just to say that certain activities are being rolled out in our stores around how we handle our food cases, how we deploy our brewed coffee stations, so those are, as we speak, in progress. The more holistic one will take longer, as I shared in the analyst conference back in December. ", "Howard Schultz", "In terms of the health and wellness initiative beginning with Vivanno and now oatmeal and other things we have planned, in view of the competitive issues, I don't want to get into the specifics of either category or products or how we're going to communicate that. Suffice it to say that we believe that we've got a unique opportunity to build that category consistent with what we've done already, and I think it speaks to the desire our customers have and the license that Starbucks has to participate in that space. ", "Also I'd say that very few people are aware that most Americans every single day, of all the beverages that they consume, coffee provides them with the largest level of antioxidants. So that's a very interesting opportunity as well, but we believe very strongly that we've got a unique opportunity to create a category within the company that currently does not exist.", "With regard to Sorbetto, we continue to evaluate Sorbetto. As you know, it was launched in Southern California as a test and we're continuing to evaluate it. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Tom Forte - Telsey Advisory Group.", "Tom Forte - Telsey Advisory Group", "I had a marketing question. So during the quarter, when you test launched the VIA instant coffee in Seattle and Chicago, it's our understanding that in Chicago the launch coincided with some local television advertising promoting the product. I wanted to know if you were to compare the launch in Chicago versus Seattle, what would be the comparison and what are your thoughts on using national television advertising when you launch the product this fall?", "Howard Schultz", "Well, you're exactly right. We had a control market which was Seattle which had no external advertising or marketing and Chicago which had kind of a comprehensive spend that was broadcast driven as well as outdoor. I'm not going to share with you - I don't mean to be coy but I'm sorry, I'm not going to share with you - the effectiveness of that other than to say that we were satisfied and continue to be satisfied with the success of Seattle and Chicago. ", "The U.K. got limited advertising and the U.K. has done extremely well with Heathrow Airport being just a fantastic example because mostly as a result of travel. But we've got plans for the fall. In the coming weeks and months we'll communicate more about VIA. One tidbit I can give you is the promise that we see in terms of the external distribution. Both Target and Costco have done very well. Costco was sold out of the product last weekend, couldn't find it in the warehouses, and we were scattering around to try and get them product for Sunday. ", "So we're pretty enthused and the most encouraging thing is just the repeat customers trading up from the three to the 12-pack and the stories we hear from customers who are now taking VIA in places where they've never been able to have Starbucks coffee before. And the level of cannibalization has been consistent with the expectations we've had, so we feel very good about it. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mitch Kaiser - Buckingham Research.", "Mitch Kaiser - Buckingham Research", "Just a point of clarification and then a question. Just on the comps results for the March period, was there any Easter shift in there?", "And my question is: On maintenance CapEx, with a lot of companies now cutting unit growth it seems like and building cash that it looks like perhaps some of this cash might be going into more aggressive maintenance and upgrading of the stores. Are there any plans or can you give us your plans for maintenance CapEx? Is that going to go up or any more efforts to just maintain the look of the store from a maintenance CapEx perspective?", "Troy Alstead", "Mitch, in terms of the Easter shift, Easter did move. It wasn't enough to have any kind of meaningful impact on our numbers that I would speak to, so nothing there particularly to report.", "And then in terms of CapEx, clearly as a percentage of total our reinvestment back into our existing stores is just a much bigger piece of the total since we're investing far less in new stores right now. And reinvesting back in our store base is a top priority for us. We will keep doing that and we will always do more of it. ", "That spend will grow over time in proportion to the store base as it has grown. Often that will be scheduled refurbishment of our store base to make sure that we're maintaining the excellence of that experience in our stores. At times that investment will accommodate things such as fitting Clover into a store as it comes up, remodels that we expand our ability to introduce that product to our customers in the right ways. And where we've made that kind of investment we see great success. ", "So I won't provide specific numbers to you, although I think if you dig back to the presentation I made at the analyst conference in New York we did provide a bit more breakout there of how we split up our CapEx among the various components. But I would just leave you with reinvesting back in our existing store base is critical; it's a top priority and we will keep making it a top priority.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions).

Howard? ", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report a very solid quarter. And to close out an extremely challenging, but ultimately very rewarding fiscal year. While few could possibly have anticipated the extraordinary economic and operating challenges, that has confronted us over the past years, it is with these same challenges that led us to some of our best work. Under a common purpose, and I know that Starbucks is a better and stronger company for having come through it.", "A more disciplined focus on operations and the introduction of numerous initiatives to permanently improve our cost structure each contributed to the positive earnings momentum that we are seeing.", "In addition, and even more important are the outstanding performance of our partners and the many innovations we introduced to improve our in-store customer experience in the US and abroad. ", "All of these efforts have set the stage for what we believe will be long-term revenue and profit growth. That said, we know that we have more work to do. I'm pleased to report that both one and two year sequential quarter comparable store sales trends have improved. With same-store sales in both our US and international businesses stronger as we exited the fourth quarter than when we entered it.", "Our results also point to the success of the broad based improvements that we have made globally in each of our beverage, food, Consumer Product Group and merchandise channels in the fourth quarter and throughout the year.", "I will take you through the business highlights for the quarter and year end, make a few remarks about some of the trends, we've observed in fiscal 2009, and then tell you what\u2019s on the horizon for fiscal 2010.", "Then Troy will discuss financial results in more detail and to provide updated guidance for fiscal 2010. Consolidated same-store sales trends improved to negative 1% from negative 5% in the previous quarter.", "Non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 10.4%. Non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4 totaled $0.24, compared to EPS of $0.10 in the prior year, an increase of 140%.", "Turning to the full year. Let me begin by highlighting some of the steps we took to improve our core business. The tough decisions we made to right-size our cost structure are well known. And at this point, Troy will provide a final review of the 2009 savings in a moment.", "This important work has allowed us to build a permanent, sustainable model for future profitable growth. I'm pleased to report, that we were able to accomplish the cost savings we did at the same time, as we were able to materially improve our in-store customer experience.", "On last quarter's call, I told you that we had been seeing gradual improvement in our customer satisfaction scores from the beginning of the fiscal year. While this trend has continued and we saw further improvement in the fourth quarter, in fact, by the end of the year, our customer satisfaction scores were up a full 10 percentage points from where we began in January.", "Our efforts to highlight our coffee differentiation and leadership position took a step forward during this quarter, building on the ongoing strength of Pike Place Roast, the sales success of (PRODUCT) RED whole bean coffee and continued benefits of espresso excellence training.", "We are seeing outstanding results for our seasonal offerings, where we've been able to build on high levels of customer anticipation with an integrated go-to-market approach. We brought Anniversary Blend whole bean coffee back to our stores every year, since we first introduced it in 1996 in honor of our 25th anniversary, and during the quarter it achieved the best sales results in its history, and Pumpkin Spice Latte is on the same track. ", "Complementing this improvement in the core business are several relevant consumer-driven innovations and initiatives. Our extensive work to upgrade the quality of our food has been well received.", "The reinvention of our bakery recipes with a focus on real and simple ingredients has improved taste, consistency and overall customer experience. As we have simplified recipes, we have also driven greater efficiencies through consolidation of vendors, reduced waste and better on-time delivery to stores.", "We launched the new program with a Free food day and drew 1.5 million customers into our stores to sample the new lineup. Importantly, we saw food contribute to ticket growth in the quarter.", "We'll continue to make progress toward evolving our food business, as we expand health and wellness options for our customers in the months ahead. ", "Momentum and excitement for our North American launch of Starbucks VIA\u2122, our 100% natural roasted soluble coffee, built throughout the quarter. VIA\u2122 gives us a very strong play in both single-serve and instant coffee markets. VIA\u2122 wins on quality, portability and ease of use. It produces less waste than other single serve options. And from a cost effectiveness standpoint, it requires zero investment for the consumer in equipment. ", "Most importantly, it wins on taste. In fact, VIA\u2122 was recently recognized by Progressive Grocer as a 2009 Editor's Pick for Best New Consumer Product. It\u2019s important to note that VIA\u2122 is not just a product introduction or promotion, it is a significant new global growth platform within our core business, with strong margins consistent with our other whole bean and ground coffees. ", "The integrated launch brought together partners in stores, advertising, PR, and digital and social media to begin to go after the $21 billion global instant coffee category in a big way. And we are encouraged by our research, which demonstrates that customers who tasted VIA\u2122 during our VIA\u2122 taste challenge were by a significant measure motivated to purchase. ", "Starbucks VIA\u2122 is not only resonating with our core customers, but it has enabled us to tap into new and incremental use occasions and niche states. Office workers for late night meetings, business travelers, teachers, healthcare professionals, the list goes on. ", "When we were planning to launch VIA\u2122, we were confident that its taste, quality and portability, combined with an increasingly on-the-go consumer, would create new use occasions for our company and this product. ", "We now know through our research that we're not only creating new use occasions, we're also seeing a significant number of customers using VIA\u2122 for their at-home occasions. At the same time, we've seen a de-minimis (Inaudible) of our whole bean and ground coffee business.", "As you know, we pre-launched VIA\u2122 in Seattle, Chicago and a number of stores in London in March and expanded the offering through the US and Canada at the end of September. I am delighted to report that in the initial weeks of the rollout, VIA\u2122 has outperformed the initial test markets. And VIA\u2122 has already given us opportunities for sales and conversions, where we've never had them before, in the aisles of specialty retailers like REI, on airlines like United and easyJet in the UK, and now in over 1500 major foodservice locations throughout the US.", "We recently announced the launch of VIA\u2122 Decaf, a top customer request, which will be coming out on November 17th. And we are now exploring ways to build on VIA's early success with multiple new varietals and blends and form factors.", "We are planning to expand VIA\u2122 internationally beyond Canada in 2010, including in the UK, where 80% of the coffee market is instant. And we are actively exploring opportunities to lead with VIA\u2122 in markets where Starbucks does not yet have a significant retail presence, but where instant coffee is dominant.", "VIA\u2122 is also providing an unexpected brand halo to Starbucks. After sampling VIA\u2122, customers we survey, told us that both the taste and the story enhanced their overall image of our company. We believe that VIA\u2122 will create long-term incremental growth and profitability in our stores and beyond, as we expand into new channels, and new geographies.", "Building, on our ongoing efforts to provide value to customers, last week we announced the next evolution of our customer loyalty program, My Starbucks Rewards. We based changes on customer feedback and learning over the past years, and we are confident that the new program will provide a simpler and more rewarding experience for customers, while at the same time driving increased traffic and frequency and ultimately increasing sales.", "More than 3.5 million customers are registered Starbucks cardholders. We've seen statistically significant increases in frequency and ticket from these loyal customers. My Starbucks Rewards, will launch on December 26, traditionally the start of our heaviest card redemption period. The new streamlined program delivers value with no annual fee, allows members to use their favorite registered card, a significant customer request and provides customized rewards that increased the more it is used, driving both acquisition and traffic. The Starbucks Card has also been a strong performer even in the midst of last year's difficult holiday season, so we have every reason to believe and to expect that the latest evolution of the card with its expanded benefits and value and ease of use, will perform well.", "As you can see, innovation is playing a key strategic role in our go-to-market strategy. In an increasingly competitive environment, we've been able to tell our story using social media and other tools to increase share with our existing customers in both frequency and spend, and to attract new customers as well. Our recently launched iPhone applications has exceeded 500,000 downloads in the first week, and have consistently been in the top three downloads on iTunes since it was introduced.", "We've now been recognized as the number one, most engaged brand online, the biggest brand on Facebook with nearly five million fans, the biggest brand in our category on Twitter with 450,000 followers. In 2009, we invested in a best-of-class digital team and capability, and we have a unique opportunity to connect with consumers in impactful ways.", "We see our recent ranking in a proprietary study as the number one preferred restaurant brand for teens as strong evidence that social media innovation is resonating. The combination of these new channels of communication and our retail store footprint has helped us deliver a consistent go-to-market approach, as evidenced in our recent campaigns for coffee and VIA\u2122, and you'll see more of this as we launch holiday this season.", "With more than 16,000 stores globally, we also have a unique opportunity to tell the Starbucks story and our retail experience. We are reinvigorating the physical environment of our stores through new store concepts and designs. All newly constructed company-operated stores worldwide will be LEED\u00ae certified beginning this calendar year, with projection, construction and cost parameters.", "This initiative, coupled with locally relevant store designs and renovations, is helping us form deeper connections to customers in their own neighborhoods. We've gained important insights on custom brewing from our new mercantile store, the 15th Avenue Coffee and Tea store, and we will be applying some of those as we move forward.", "I would be reminisced if I limited my comments on innovation to only the customer experience. Behind the scenes, we have continued to build on our work to drive efficiency through lean processes, optimal scheduling and technology upgrades. These innovations, though not always visible, continue to help drive margin growth and customer and partner satisfaction.", "Our overall international business closed the year with strong momentum. Margin expansion continued, and we are well positioned to begin our next phase of growth internationally.", "Troy will discuss specific results that I wanted to share, just a few highlights. We are particularly pleased with the ongoing strength of our business in China, which has continued to deliver positive same-store sales growth and improved profitability throughout this difficult economic period. We continue to see significant opportunities for store growth in Greater China, which we believe will ultimately be our largest market outside of the US.", "On a recent trip just this past quarter, I saw firsthand the ongoing emotional connection we've already created with customers. I visited Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hangzhou and was reminded of our early days of growth and development in the US. In each of these very diverse major cities, Starbucks has become part of the daily Chinese ritual. The China market, which now has nearly 700 stores, holds the potential for thousands.", "In the UK, we're seeing a number of improvements in the overall performance of the business, including increased traffic as several of our customer-driven initiatives beginning to take hold. We've also announced a set of initiatives with Fairtrade, a very important partnership for consumers in the UK and across Europe.", "Starbucks has converted all of our espresso drinks and beverages to Fairtrade in the UK, and we will do the same across Europe beginning next year. This is one of the many reasons why we've just been named the most ethical coffee company in Europe by Allegra Strategies. We are making a further brand deposit in the UK with the launch of (PRODUCT) RED, and we hope that it resonates as much there as it has in the US.", "We expect to continue to make steady gains in our international markets towards top line growth, not only by optimizing our retail portfolio, but by beginning to expand our CPG and other channels. CPG remains a highly profitable segment of our business. Packaged coffee has seen improved trends for the quarter, driven by aggressive pricing, new packaging graphics, new sizes and new distribution partners.", "We have also launched VIA\u2122 in some key CPG channels, and as I've mentioned earlier, including fantastic debuts and results in both Costco and Target. We will be launching VIA\u2122 in grocery, mass and drug accounts later this year under our recently signed distribution agreement with the cost of sales & marketing. This new strategic partnership will not only provide us the ability to drive broad and deep distribution for VIA\u2122, but it also allows us to continue to expand and grow our packaged goods business at an accelerated rate while capturing more value for Starbucks in the long term.", "We also made a significant leadership move in the fourth quarter by appointing one of our strongest executive talents, Michelle Gass, to oversee Seattle's Best Coffee as its new President. We have a meaningful opportunity to significantly profitably grow Seattle's Best Coffee brand in the US and around the world as its own distinctive experience.", "I'm pleased to report that by the end of 2009, more than 9000 Subway restaurants in the US will feature Seattle's Best Coffee, as well as our plans to expand into even more Subway restaurants during 2010. We also will bring Seattle's Best Coffee to a group of more than 800 Subway restaurants in Canada before the end of 2009.", "I am also very pleased to report that we recently made two key additions to our management team. Annie Young-Scrivner is our new Global Chief Marketing Officer, and Kalen Holmes will be joining us as the Executive Vice President for Partner Resources. Both of these executives have significant experience driving change in growth in large global organizations, and we are delighted to have them at Starbucks.", "While we have made significant progress in fiscal '09, we know that going forward we have much more to do. And as I said in the last call, there is no one at Starbucks doing the victory lap. We realize the opportunity, we realize the tough economic environment, but obviously we've made significant progress.", "In fiscal '10, we will continue to aggressively manage expenses and incorporate the learning from our US business into international markets. We will leverage our technology investments such as updated point-of-sale and scheduling systems to drive performance on a store-by-store basis. We will continue to innovate and stay relevant to consumers. I firmly believe that our innovation pipeline heading into 2010 and beyond is among the most robust and promising that we have ever had. And as always, we will continue to connect with our customers by staying true to our values and our guiding principles around the environment, the communities we serve and the ethical way we do business.", "Based on improving operating results and performance metrics over the last two quarters, the fact that we have a longer holiday period this year and the strength of our holiday products and promotions, we remain cautiously optimistic about the upcoming holiday season and the near term. More important, I am confident that by staying focused on our business and relevant to our customers, integrating the learning from our ongoing transformational agenda and continuing to respond to the new calculus of today's consumer marketplace, Starbucks will achieve steady growth in sales and profits both over the immediate and the long-term.", "I will now give the call to Troy.", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, Howard. And good afternoon, everyone. As Howard indicated, our fourth-quarter results represent an extension of the momentum that started to build in our third quarter. Today I'll provide additional details on our fourth-quarter performance, including the continued progress we've made in the area of cost savings and margin expansion, as well as the improvement we've realized in comparable store sales trends.", "Additionally, I'll recap our 2009 full-year results and then provide an outlook for our fiscal 2010, including some key financial targets. Fourth quarter revenues were $2.4 billion, down 4% from $2.5 billion a year ago. The revenue decline was primarily driven by foreign currency translation, fewer company-operated stores and a 1% decline in comparable store sales attributable to a 1% decrease in traffic.", "And importantly, consolidated comps, as well as US and international comps, ended the quarter higher than where they started the quarter. We reported consolidated operating income of $199 million in the fourth quarter, which includes $53 million of restructuring charges, nearly all related to lease exit and other costs associated with the store closures. Excluding those charges, non-GAAP operating income was $253 million. This compares to Q4 fiscal 2008 operating income of $14 million and non-GAAP operating income of $119 million.", "Consolidated operating margin was 8.2% on a GAAP basis and 10.4% on a non-GAAP basis, which represented a 570-basis-point improvement from the 4.7% non-GAAP operating margin reported a year ago. In line with recent trends, we are realizing the benefits derived from the operational efficiencies we implemented in our business throughout the year. I'll provide more detail around that shortly. ", "Slightly offsetting these benefits, G&A expenses increased as a percent of revenue compared to last year due to higher performance-based compensation. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was lower than normal due to an employment tax audit settlement. As a result of the settlement, we've recorded approximately $17 million in additional payroll tax for the quarter, which shows up in our store operating expenses. This additional payroll tax is fully offset by an income tax credit, resulting in no impact to net profit. This tax audit settlement lowered our effective tax rate by roughly 4.5 percentage points in the quarter. Otherwise, the effective tax rate would have been in line with our historical rate.", "And I will point out again, this unusually low tax rate had no impact on EPS as it was completely offset by additional store operating expenses. Earnings per share was $0.20 for the fourth quarter compared to $0.01 per share in last year's fiscal fourth quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.24 compared to non-GAAP EPS of $0.10 a year ago.", "Let me now move on to fourth-quarter results from our operating segments, which I will review on a non-GAAP basis. I'd like to point out that we have a segment reporting change this quarter, and my overview reflects that change.", "Our US foodservice business, which has previously been reported under the US segment, was moved this quarter to the CPG segment in order to reflect the direct line management reporting change to CPG leadership. Historical restatements will be published on our website in the near future. Total US net revenues for the quarter were $1.7 billion, a 4% decline from $1.8 billion a year ago.", "Company-operated US retail revenues declined 3% to $1.6 billion for the quarter, primarily due to 474 fewer company-operated stores and a 1% decline in comparable store sales. The comp decline was driven by a 1% decrease in traffic, while the average value per transaction was flat. ", "With respect to comp trends, we continued to see sequential quarter improvement on both a one-year and a two-year basis. One-year comps improved five percentage points compared to the third quarter, while two-year comps improved two percentage points. The average value per transaction was favorably impacted by food, as well as a more focused and more effective merchandise assortment. Offsetting this favorability was the impact from our value offerings, including the return this year of our Treat Receipt promotion, which ran four weeks longer than last year. These offerings are part of a strategy designed to increase frequency with our loyal customer base and to drive new customers into our stores.", "Reflecting back on Howard's comments earlier about VIA\u2122, while the fourth-quarter impact was minimal due to the timing of the launch, results from the two US test markets and early results from the late September rollout support our belief that VIA\u2122 will have no impact on brewed sales volumes within our stores.", "In fact, while we expected some cannibalization of our packaged coffee business within the stores, the actual cannibalization rate has been very modest to date. The result is a largely incremental revenue stream with a product margin that is accretive to our existing store product margins.", "US cost of sales, including occupancy, was 40.1% of revenues in the fourth quarter, a significant improvement of 520 basis points compared to the year-ago period. Most of this progress was the result of operational efficiencies designed to minimize waste in coffee, food and dairy.", "Favorable dairy costs also contributed to the improvement. We also continued to gain traction in the US from our efforts to optimize in-store labor. The evidence is reflected in US store operating expenses, where we finished the fourth quarter at 40.1% of total revenues, a 230-basis-point improvement compared to last year's fourth quarter. The $17 million payroll expense related to the tax settlement I highlighted earlier negatively impacted US store operating expenses by 100 basis points. US operating income was $207 million for the quarter, more than double last year's nearly $80 million in operating income.", "The operating margin improved 760 basis points to 12.0% of related revenues from 4.4% a year ago. The operational improvements we've talked about, played a big role in the margin expansion as they directly impacted our company-operated retail business. Also noteworthy, operating margins have improved in our licensed store business as we had similar success in strengthening the store portfolio, enhancing the food program and reorganizing the licensed store support organization.", "We are extremely pleased with the operating margin expansion that we've been able to generate in this difficult environment.", "Equally satisfying and encouraging is that we have been able to accomplish this while at the same time improving the customer experience, which is the heart of our business and a key indicator of future growth.", "Moving now to results from our international segment, international total net revenues declined 4% to $514 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, driven by foreign currency impact due to the stronger US dollar, compared with the British pound and Canadian dollar.", "Comparable store sales for the quarter were flat for the year-ago period, comprised of a 1% increase in transactions, offset by a 2% decrease in the average value per transaction. ", "The two percentage point improvement from the third quarter, was largely driven by the UK and Canada, our two largest company operated markets outside of the US. Importantly, the UK market reported positive comparable store sales growth in the quarter. Similar to the US, we've seen UK customer satisfaction scores increase, as we refreshed a significant number of stores and improved the in-store experience through a relentless focus on operational excellence.", "International operating income was $45 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, a significant increase from $22 million last year. Operating margin improved by 470 basis points to 8.8%, its highest level since the first quarter of fiscal 2008.", "Cost of sales in occupancy as a percent of revenue improved by 260 basis points, primarily driven by more efficient spending on store maintenance and in-store reduction of waste.", "Margin gains in store operating expenses and other expenses were partially offset by an increase in G&A. Of note, last year's G&A rate was unusually low due to performance-related compensation adjustments. We are pleased by the improvement in our international segment, now clearly back on the path for becoming a profitable growth engine for the company.", "Canada, the UK, China and Japan are our largest international markets and drive the majority of the segment's revenue in operating profits. Each of these markets is profitable to Starbucks. Each is a priority for future investment, and each is a key component of future growth. Our focus on these important markets, along with the ability to leverage key strategic partnerships in other markets abroad, positions us well as we move into fiscal 2010.", "I\u2019ll now move on to the results from the Global Consumer Products Group. CPG total net revenues decreased 2% to $188 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, primarily due to lower US foodservice revenues, partially offset by higher revenues from packaged coffee. ", "The foodservice revenue decline is primarily related to continued softness in the hospitality industry. Packaged coffee is an increasingly competitive segment of the business, and were focused on retaining our share of the market by reinforcing our product differentiation through increased and sharpened consumer messaging. ", "Operating income for CPG was $93 million in the fourth quarter, a 10% increase from last year. The operating margin improved by 530 basis points to 49.3%, driven by lower foodservice support costs and lower marketing expenses compared with last year, when we launched a new ready-to-drink product in Japan.", "In addition, our income from equity investments increased year-over-year due to improved profitability from our North American coffee partnership.", "I will now recap our fiscal 2009 performance in a few key metrics. Earnings per share was $0.52, compared to $0.43 last year. Excluding restructuring and transformation related costs, non-GAAP EPS was $0.80, compared to $0.71 per share in fiscal '08. We recognized $332 million in restructuring charges in fiscal 2009, the majority of which related to the previously announced store closures.", "Consolidated revenues for fiscal '09 dropped 6% to $9.8 billion. The decline was mostly due to a 6% drop in comparable store sales, comprised of a 4% decline in transactions and a 2% decline in the average value per transaction. ", "Foreign currency translation also contributed to the decline. With respect to comparable store sales, the overall performance was largely driven by the US segment, where comps decreased by 6% overall, with a 4% decline in traffic and a 2% decline in the average value per transaction.", "Internationally, we did not see as much deterioration, with overall comps finishing at minus 2%, comprised of a 1% drop each in transactions and the average value per transaction.", "As we've discussed today and in past quarters, we are encouraged by the fact that comp trends improved both in the US and internationally as the year progressed. Also encouraging this year was the performance of the fiscal 2009 age class of new stores. While, it is too early to evaluate the complete portfolio, the trends we are seeing support our belief that this age class will once again meet our historical hurdle rates and they will be the best performing group of the last few years.", "In terms of liquidity, Starbucks continues to enjoy a solid financial foundation. Even during this challenging year, in the midst of the most difficult economic cycle in decades, Starbucks produced the highest operating cash flow and free cash flow in the history of the company, underscoring the strength and resiliency of the brand and our business model.", "Operating cash flow for the year was $1.4 billion, enabling us to generate free cash flow in excess of $900 million. Short-term borrowings remained at a zero balance at year end, leaving essentially $1 billion borrowing capacity available to us under our existing credit facility.", "We also reduced our capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 to just under $450 million, driven by a reduction in new store openings in response to the global economic slowdown. As I mentioned earlier, through a dedicated effort across the organization, we delivered approximately $580 million in cost savings for fiscal 2009. As you will recall from our previous discussions, this compared to a most recent target of $550 million and the original target of $400 million established less than a year ago.", "The largest component of the savings comes from our efforts within the store to optimize labor and reduce waste. This category is the primary reason why we exceeded the projected savings targets, as we were able to gain earlier and better traction on these initiatives as the year progressed. ", "We finished the year with roughly $190 million of savings in this area. It\u2019s important that I mention again here, that at the same time we made our stores more efficient, we drove significant improvements in our customer satisfaction scores. ", "The next-largest savings component was associated with non-retail support savings, including headcount reductions. We delivered savings of about $180 million in this area. Supply chain savings in procurement, manufacturing and logistics accounted for approximately $110 million in savings. And finally, savings from the store closures totaled roughly $100 million for the year.", "Fiscal 2009 was a year of significant change for the company. It was a year of renewed focus on the excellence of the customer experience. It was a year of heightened financial rigor and discipline. And it was a year of relevant profitable innovation, setting the stage for growth in 2010 and beyond. With that foundation established, we are pleased to provide our outlook targets for fiscal 2010, reflecting a return to growth, generated from more diversified sources compared to the past and increasing profitability.", "We expect fiscal 2010 revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single digits, driven by modestly positive comparable store sales, a 53rd fiscal week, and approximately 300 planned net new stores.", "Of the 300 net new stores, we expect approximately 100 to be in the US, primarily licensed, and approximately 200 to be in our international markets, also primarily licensed. We recognize the difficult economic situation that many consumers still find themselves in, and we do not expect that to significantly change over the course of the year. We will continue to approach new stores with caution, given the economic environment, and we will evaluate these growth plans as we progress throughout the year.", "Overall, we expect little net impact to the bottom line from commodities. We expect dairy cost to be unfavorable for the year. As indicated in our third quarter 10-Q, we recently implemented a dairy hedging program to mitigate roughly a quarter of this pricing risk. Offsetting dairy, we expect coffee to be slightly favorable in fiscal 2010.", "Lastly, at this point in time, we foresee little impact from foreign currency movements. As I have said in the past, I expect operating margins for both the US business and the international business to reach the mid-teens. While we won't get there in fiscal 2010, the work we've done over the last year provides the foundation for meaningful progress in that direction.", "In both the US and international segments, full year non-GAAP operating margin improvement is expected to be in a range of 200 to 250 basis points. And our CPG segment margin is expected to remain in its current range of 35% to 40%. Our expectation, based on the cumulative result of these margins, is a consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 10% to 11%, crossing the meaningful full-year double-digit threshold for the first time since fiscal 2007.", "As a reminder, the segment operating margins reflect the reporting change I highlighted earlier. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 35%, which is close to its historical level. And this leads to our outlook for earnings per share. We expect fiscal 2010 non-GAAP EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20%, including roughly $0.02 to $0.03 per share coming from the addition of the 53rd fiscal week.", "Not included in this estimate is the impact from the remaining international store closures, which we expect to be $0.02 to $0.03 in restructuring that will be spread throughout the year. We expect to see a very favorable first quarter based on improving business trends and factoring in the lapping of a difficult holiday period last year.", "In addition, we will be realizing the full benefits of the cost savings work that gained much of its traction after the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The non-GAAP EPS comparisons will be more difficult in the last three quarters of the fiscal year. We are preparing to launch VIA\u2122 domestically in the CPG channel in the middle of fiscal 2010 through a recently signed broker agreement. While this avenue allows us to control what we believed is a great opportunity with our brand outside our stores, there are upfront investments in the business that we will need to make to support this model. Therefore, in line with our previous expectations, we expect VIA\u2122 to be profit neutral to Starbucks for fiscal 2010.", "Finally, we expect cash flow from operations to again reach approximately $1.4 billion in fiscal 2010. And our expectation for capital spend next year is in the range of $500 million to $550 million, a slight increase from fiscal 2009. Roughly half of this total is expected to go to renovations and store equipment upgrades, approximately one-quarter of the total is expected to be spent on systems and technology upgrades both in-store and back-office, and the remaining one-quarter is expected to be spread among new stores and other capital investments.", "In closing, fiscal 2009 represented a year of unprecedented challenges and change for Starbucks. As we enter the new fiscal year, we recognize that challenges remain and there is still a tremendous amount of work ahead. However, it is important that we acknowledge the accomplishments of our partners this past year.", "During that time, we shifted our culture and business model from one dependent on high top line growth to one that is more disciplined and operationally efficient, laying the foundation for profitable growth in the future. We have improved the Starbucks experience for our customers through a rededicated focus on in-store operational excellence. We have raised the bar on innovation, launching products and concepts that once again set the standard for the industry. And we are an innovator in how we connect with our customers through nontraditional channels such as social media while leveraging the relationships we have in our CPG channel to advertise for the broader benefit of the brand.", "Our balance sheet, cash flow and liquidity are all in excellent health, and our business mix continues to become more diversified as the international and CPG businesses grow. We are confident that the best days for Starbucks still lie ahead as we look to capitalize on the strength of our global brand and the abundant opportunities that remain in markets and channels around the world.", "With that, now let me turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Christian.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Troy, you highlighted the free cash in the business this year and what you expect to do next year, but you stopped short of talking about what's your plan to do with that. So if you could talk about either what you plan to do about it or what's the timeframe in which you might make that decision. And then just a clarification, you stopped short of saying comps are actually positive now. But I assume, just given the trend, that they would have to be currently positive. Is that true?", "Troy Alstead", "No, we don't report separate months. So I'm going to let you work on the arithmetic. All I'll let you know is that we had negative 1% comps for the quarter, and I'll repeat what we said. We had improving trends and we ended the quarter stronger than how we began the quarter. And just to be consistent with our history, we don't talk about specific months.", "Now, back to your first question, our top priority for cash of course is investing back in our existing business, making sure we're maintaining the excellence of the assets that we have in place. And next priority is just fund the growth opportunities that we have, VIA\u2122, new store growth around the world and so on. And we see abundant opportunities there.", "With that said, I think fiscal 2009 demonstrates the cash-generating power that we have in this business. And I do expect that as we move, again, into 2010, we will have excess cash above and beyond those critical business needs that I've described in the business.", "Now, with that said, I also remained a bit cautious about this economic environment that we're in. We are on the front end here of the first holiday quarter, which is our strongest cash producing quarter of the year. So we're not going to make any conclusions on how best to deploy that excess cash until it comes through this quarter.", "What I will say is that we are evaluating how to distribute excess cash and what is the appropriate distribution strategy. We're having those discussions with our Board. And I would expect as we get somewhere to the latter half of our second quarter, then we will conclude that work and be ready to talk about what the next step is for us. So, more to come.", "Operator", "Our net question comes from the line of Steven Kron, Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Maybe just to add on to that question, Troy, just the guidance that you provided of 15% to 20% earnings growth, it would seem, if my math is right, that you could pretty much get there with the rolling forward of the cost saves that you have kind of realized in the back half of this year and benefiting, really, the first part of the year, that alone.", "So simplistically, are you guys thinking that the same-store sales that you are guiding to is enough to offset some of the natural inflation that we might see in the business? Or are you expecting G&A to be much higher next year? And to John's question, will potentially the use of cash flow for buybacks be upside to the guidance that you provided?", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks Steve. There was a lot there. Let me start with the cost saves. I think the important thing to mention, I'll just repeat what we've talked about early in the year, these cost save initiatives that have delivered $580 million in '09, as you know, came in throughout the year. That will annualize to a bigger number in fiscal '10. And also point out that this muscle that we have built in '09 gives us opportunity to go after more in the years ahead. We have new capabilities here that we didn't have in the past around driving efficiencies through every corner of our business. And I would expect that beyond annualizing that number that we will continue to seek out and find efficiencies throughout the business. With that said, and you made this point well, there are natural inflationary pressures that\u2019s just over every unit business. Wage inflation, real estate, in perhaps different environments than now, but those cost increases are always there, commodities from time-to-time. ", "Healthcare is a critical element of ours. Given that we have such a broad-based healthcare program, we are more exposed to cost increases there the many retailers are. So the sum of all that is that the cost saves that we will get in '10 and that we will continue to seek are intended to at least give us a tool to offset natural inflation in the business. There was a day when the high comp growth we had was how we offset those cost increases. We've built a model this year that gives us one more way to do that. We expect positive comparable store sales this year. And the combination of that with increased cost saves are what we believes drives the margin improvement in the year ahead.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS", "Could you discuss the decline, it seemed like there was a deceleration in US licensed store revenue, and I'm wondering if I'm seeing that right. Is there any change and is this just the impact of certain types of locations, like we were talking about airports, hospitality perhaps not doing as well? Or is there a change in strategy by Starbucks on that? And then secondly, with regards to Seattle's Best licensing, how meaningful could that be to earnings? You mentioned the 9000 stores with Subway. Thanks.", "Howard Schultz", "This is Howard. We had a very good and robust year in licensing. Cliff, if you want to take the question with regard to his interpretation of the downturn in revenue, I think that would be helpful.", "Cliff Burrows", "Thank you, Howard, and David, thanks for the question. Our licensed business, as you know, feeds in part off the traffic volumes in people who operate the units. And certainly, most environments, a lot of environments, have had the same challenges over the last 12 months. We have certainly seen a very strong business model, and we're really confident that some of the disciplines we've brought around our overhead costs will pass through and are passing through to the licensed business. It's been a good year, and we see good opportunities for future growth.", "Troy Alstead", "With regard to Seattle's Best Coffee, I think the fact, first off, that the organization was willing to have Michelle depart the core brand and go after Seattle's Best Coffee represents internally, and now to this audience, how bullish we are ultimately on the future of Seattle's Best Coffee. I think the marketplace has changed to a large degree where the coffee consumer is going after multiple tastes, and although their loyalty to Starbucks is significant, there are times when they want perhaps a different kind of coffee, whether it's flavored or a lighter roast. In view of that, we want to be able to take Seattle's Best Coffee out of the shadow of Starbucks and really for the first time in its history have a life of its own. So the organization is beginning to take form. And what I would say is that we have lifted the guardrails of Seattle's Best Coffee in terms of licensing opportunities, sales opportunities, and the Subway opportunity that we've outlined today is just one of many conversations that we're having. And I think, candidly, given the fact that the fast-food players have gone after the breakfast business, specifically McDonald's, in such a big way and they've made such a big push in coffee, their core competitors want to compete directly in that space. And we have a coffee that is not just a supplier, but a national brand. And we've got training and competency that we believe we can help them. So the Subway situation I think is an interesting case study, and there\u2019ll be more to come. But I think SBC is in its infant stages of what it could be domestically and internationally. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein. ", "Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein", "I had a question about some of the news flow that we've seen recently in the international business. And that was just it seems like they are changing some of the ownerships, Spain and France. What piece is licensed, what piece you control. Is there anything that we should read into that? Is that kind of be a help in terms of managing G&A? Is there now G&A that you can reduce, because you're consolidating some of that ownership? Just trying to get a sense of the profitability for the international business.", "Howard Schultz", "I think I'll try and answer the first piece of that question as it relates to France and Spain and then give it to Troy on the overall strategy. France and Spain was somewhat of an outlier. We've got a very strong and long lasting partnership with the Arango family that operates a company called Grupo Vips in Spain, and they became our partner in France as well.", "France has some of the highest level of transactions of any market internationally. However, because of the economic downturn that was experienced in Spain this year, 20% unemployment, we felt that perhaps we were better positioned to invest in the growth and development of France, given what we believe to be a very strong future market for us. And so, we basically created a swap between Spain and Portugal and France. And I think both partners are happy. But more specifically, we see France as a long-term growth market, given how robust that business has been at the unit level in terms of transactions, some of the highest we have internationally. And Troy can answer kind of the macro question.", "Troy Alstead", "", "Sara, I think how I would expand on Howard's point is just to say that that transaction, for all the reasons Howard said, is really consistent with the strategy we have internationally. We intend to own the biggest markets around the world, where we can invest infrastructure, where we can control our destiny and go after that big opportunity. And that is consistent with China, Canada, the UK, now France and Germany markets that have huge growth opportunities in years to come, and make it worthwhile for us to invest against them and control the earnings and returns that we think we'll get down the road. ", "We have a great model in place where we can leverage partners who bring existing infrastructures to place in smaller markets around the world. And that transaction in Spain and France and Portugal really moves us clearly in that direction that creates accountability and clarity of ownership paths in those two places. It leverages our ability to go deep in the big market of France and our great partner's ability to go deep where they have expertise and capability and infrastructure.", "So, while I don't expect you'll see significant ownership changes happening internationally in the future, we are always looking at our structure and making sure that we're lining ourselves up in the way to be most effective. And from time-to-time, you may see more of that down the road. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. ", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair ", "Troy, I was wondering if you could talk about the customer reaction to the price adjustments that you did and whether or not you are seeing any incremental price stick or whether the transactions have picked up on some of the items where you adjusted the price downward?", "Troy Alstead", "", "Sharon, we've been moving to the new pricing architecture, as you know, throughout this year. As of the end of the fiscal year, we were partway through that work. We had more markets to go something in the range of half of the US territory yet to go through those pricing adjustments. We see no impact at all in terms of customer response to meaningfully talk about. And I'll just remind everybody that the whole motivation behind that pricing work is to bring more analytics and more customer responsiveness to what we do with our pricing. In every market where there's been some changes, prices have come down on those certain products. And in other cases they've come down on those products where, based on what we're hearing from customers and seeing, we are going to put a strong value foot forward. Other products go up, based on complexity and cost.", "So prices are up, prices are down. We think it's very successful. We've got a long way to go. And also say that even once we complete this initial round of work on the pricing architecture, this now is work that goes on forever. Again, it's similar to I think something I described earlier its new muscle, new capability we have around analyzing our pricing, our margins, our customers and where they're at, and that gives us, again, more tools in the toolbelt to just manage that going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ", "Question on the pending change with the Starbucks Gold Card and moving to My Starbucks Rewards. Have you done tests or run analysis to see what the average check impact on those moves will be? It seems to me like it should be a positive, but I'm curious what you're thinking going forward.", "Howard Schultz", "Cliff, did you hear the question? ", "Cliff Burrows", "Yes indeed.", "Howard Schultz", "Terry Davenport here as well.", "Cliff Burrows", "So Joe in some of the relationship with the consumer we have been listening to consumer and all this year we tried to rewards schemes this year we brought them together listening to our customers about what's most important, and we believe this game [both] recognizes loyalty and rewards frequency and we know that our most loyal customers are the ones who spend more with us and indeed the loyalty program and that we have launched is recognized to reward the most loyal customers and encourage increased frequency. Terry any insight.", "Terry Davenport", "Yeah Cliff thanks I think one of the big things is the feedback from both our customers and our story level partners is while both of the loyalty card programs exceeded our expectations its complicated to have two separate programs, and by combining them we feel like we have got a program that is much simpler and actually will reward increased visits with higher levels of benefits. So, unlike the [gold] program that was just a flat 10% across the board discount with no incentive to visit more often the new program actually rewards customers for coming more frequently.", "Howard Schultz", "", "Yeah, I would just add, just to close it up is that before we made these changes because of just being such an important customers base for Starbucks and such a visible application, this was based on a lot of not only consumer research that was both quantitative and qualitative, but really in depth discussions with our own people as well just to ensure the fact that we were all in alignment and we think we've got a winning formula here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco with Oppenheimer.", "Matthew DiFrisco - Oppenheimer", "Troy, I just want to understand the numbers and make sure we are looking at it the right way. I think you said the total number for all those numbers you gave as far as the savings from being more efficient, supply chain and the closure the stores. It looks like they are up in 2009 to $580 million which would imply, you were running at about $210 million fourth quarter run rate, given the data you have given us in the past. Is that a number that if that\u2019s the right number on a quarterly basis, just multiply that by four and you get 840 million for 2010. So, I think someone asked prior that you could basically do a lot of your earnings growth just off of harvesting that incremental nearly $300 million in savings on the operating income line. Obviously, you are going to reinvest some of that. I just want to make sure that that was the number around the 2010 million in the quarter and are those things that again will be sustainable fundamental changes to the model that will be saved. And then I just had a question I wanted to ask Howard about VIA\u2122 and longer-term, where that could go and even maybe including something that might even make more sense would be Seattle's Best with a flavored coffee and some other packaging things with the holiday, or what\u2019s on the front for Seattle's Best and VIA\u2122 possibly crossing paths?", "Troy Alstead", "Okay, Matt. I'll tackle the first part and I'll let Howard speak to VIA\u2122 afterwards. First, on the cost saves, your math is correct. We ended the year at $580 million for the full year. That essentially is $210 million in the fourth quarter. And yes, consistent with what I've been saying all along, that annualizes into that bigger number for 2010.", "Now, the caution I just want to remind everybody is that cost save intent, as well as new initiatives that we\u2019ll put in place and bring to bear as we go forward. Is about protecting our margins from natural cost increases that happen everywhere else, and importantly, giving us room to make critical investments that we need to make in the business.", "The cost saves this year are permanent. It has lowered our reset and lowered our cost structure of the company, giving us a place to grow from far more efficiently going forward. And freeing up room for us to deliver the kind of earnings growth that we expect to and that we've committed to and to, again, fund critical investments in our people, in our systems, in new products and new platforms.", "Howard Schultz", "Just to build on your other question, also, I\u2019d just like to just say that given Troy mentioned the phrase, a new muscle. And I think it's a fair assessment of what we've been able to accomplish, and on a go-forward basis, the discipline we now have in place.", "But I think it's also important that you all understand that we recognize we can't, nor do we want to, cost our way to prosperity here. We're going to grow the company. We're going to create the kind of innovation that significantly separates us from everyone else. A great example is VIA\u2122 and other things that are planned. But we are going to create the kind of attachment and relationship with our customers in the marketplace domestically and around the world that is not going to be based on the foundation of just cost containment, but we are going to start growing and innovating our way that would be very complementary to the new muscle that Troy has talked about.", "With regard to VIA\u2122 and SBC. Clearly, we now have developed a pattern pending process now that gives us a very significant competitive advantage but we are in the infant stages of what VIA\u2122 is ultimately going to be. We understand the capabilities of the Starbucks brand and a times whether or not just limitations in terms of whether or not there is a cost propound whether it\u2019s in deal or in a package bag. And as a result of that there is opportunity for SBC to come underneath. But we are too early to really kind of go after.", "What ultimately we are going to do. I will say that the VIA\u2122 opportunity is multi faceted both in terms of the instant opportunity and the runaway success that Keurig has had with Green Mountain Coffee and we believe that we have got a single serve opportunity that complements the instant coffee market very well because of the things I have already described. So this is very, very early days for what VIA\u2122 ultimately will going to be and we will be back to you in subsequent calls about the attachment it is receiving in our stores and the innovation around new varietals, new blends, other form factors and other geographies.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Just a two part question on your existing units. First, I think it was mentioned earlier that primarily the 300 units are going to be licensed in fiscal '10. I'm just wondering whether that is maybe an early indication or a preface some updated thoughts on refranchising some of the existing US units as you shift more towards the licensed-type model.", "And then secondly, Troy, you mentioned 50% of the $500 million plus CapEx, I think you said, was for renovations and upgrades. I'm just wondering whether you can give a little more color on the system as it gets older now. I'm just wondering we don't hear it too often, but perhaps an update on the status of the system, the percentage has been upgraded in recent years. When the entire system might be upgraded or what the sales comp lift returns are, just some metrics to support the reinvestment of stores and where we are on that path? Thank you.", "Troy Alstead", "Jeffrey, let me speak to that piece first, and then Howard or I will talk a little bit about the stores coming for the next year. But with respect to innovation, what you see in that capital target that I laid out for next year. Its actually very consistent with the kind of reinvestment we've made back against our system in recent years and in the year just ended 2009. ", "We have kept the portfolio maintained as it should be. When we originally make a capital allocation decision to invest in a new store, we justify that capital investment by also including, down the road, reinvestment back into the store to keep it fresh, to upgrade equipment, to maintain the leaseholds the way they need to be. So this is a part of an ongoing, routine program, not particularly a change. ", "Now, as stores age, they do require more investment. But that is not a significant change to the program that we've had in the past. That's a top-priority critical investment. And I'll point out that this past year, in '09, when we significantly pulled back capital spending in our business, that was around new stores. We did not cut back on the critical investments and renovations and upgrades into our existing stores. That's a critical asset that we will maintain.", "Now, in the years ahead, as we renovate the existing portfolio, in addition to refreshing and improving the site and the physical environment, we will also bring elements of our new designs into those remodeled stores. So that will come through the portfolio over time as we do the normal remodel program.", "Howard Schultz", "In terms of your initial question, we have no plans to in any way change the ownership structure of our company-owned stores in the US and in Canada. Obviously, we've been more flexible and more willing to do that overseas, where we get local relevancy and local competency from international partners that we couldn't get on our own.", "But I also would say that a great deal of what we've been able to accomplish this year, at the heart of that is the commitment, the passion and the operational excellence of our own people and the culture of Starbucks. I don't believe we could have done any of that to the degree we have in a system that was franchised or licensed.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "A question on the new point-of-sale system that includes better fine-tuned labor scheduling. Could you talk about the timing of that as you move throughout fiscal '10 and what you're seeing potential benefits from a cost perspective and employee perspective, from a customer perspective, and if any of that is in your numbers for fiscal '10? And just a clarification, Troy, why there wouldn't be any Forex benefit in fiscal '10. Are you hedged for the year?", "Troy Alstead", "Let me tackle the Forex real quickly, and then I will ask Cliff, John, to answer your question about point-of-sale. On foreign exchange, just given where the rates stand today and the hedging program we have in place, we don't see any impact coming, based on, again, today's rates and how that compares to '09.", "Now, that can change as we go throughout the year. So that commentary in my prepared remarks is really based on just what we see today and how that compares to, and what we have hedged and then how that compares to our experience in 2009.", "Cliff, can you talk about point-of-sale?", "Cliff Burrows", "Yes. John, this is really quite an exciting year for the stores in terms of technology. And both the [EPO] system that is in test at the moment and the labor-scheduling model are all things that we will be deploying in 2010 in the coming year. And really, it is a year of deployment. But they will certainly provide benefits for us, which as soon as we've been able to quantify those benefits, we will be able to share them. But this year is primarily around deployment and we plan for the US business and indeed North America to deploy during 2010 to all stores.", "Howard Schultz", "Cliff, can you just add what the benefits have been in the pilots?", "Cliff Burrows ", "Yes. We've seen two sides. One, it's a lot easier to operate. And it is frankly an intuitive [EPO] system where it's much easier for the consumer to order their beverage, the customer to order their beverage the way they like. They can change their mind. And it's much faster to operate, much faster to learn. And so it should improve accuracy and speed and ultimately capacity of a store at peak. There are other benefits, like the speed of processing credit cards or, indeed, our Starbucks Reward Card.", "So we see both partner benefits in terms of the time of training, the ease of use, and customer benefits in terms of speed, and benefits from the business in terms of accuracy and efficiency. So it's an exciting year.", "Howard Schultz", "I think we will take one more question. ", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird", "A question on the company-operated growth outlook. Given the trends we're seeing and development costs coming down and with your comps certainly getting better or stabilizing, why not start looking at capitalizing on the current cost environment and ramp up some unit growth, given some of the opportunities especially you have in international markets?", "Howard Schultz", "I think that's a very good question and a good way to end. Troy mentioned before, we want to go through the holiday quarter and see how the environment is shaping up. But on a parallel track, we've identified both domestically and internationally, those key markets in key cities that we feel are very important strategically for the company to both maintain and build on our share position. Both in terms of number of stores and pure share of the market. And we are and have been in discussions with key landlords and developers to really understand with great specificity, what really is the economic real estate deal that we could secure at this time.", "And as those opportunities unveil themselves, I can assure you that we will take advantage, but we want to go through the holiday quarter and really understand where the economy is going domestically and internationally and not just get too far ahead of ourselves. I think the one thing that I think we're all encouraged by is that the class of stores in 2009 are extremely promising, coupled with the new designs that Arthur Rubinfeld and his team have put together. I mentioned that last quarter that we have a store in Seattle called University Village, another one called First & Pike. We've opened one in Paris Disney and one in Tokyo. These four designs are very encouraging, very promising. And we want to leverage that.", "So I think what you're hearing is just a balanced approach to both caution and conservativitism as well as just making sure that we don't get too far ahead of ourselves, given where the environment has been. But we are going to be opportunistic, but we want to get through the holiday quarter.", "With that, we'll say goodbye. We thank you for your time, and we'll talk to you after the holiday season. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's Starbucks Coffee company conference call.

All lines are being placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Ms. DeGrande you may begin the conference.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations at Starbucks Coffee Company. With me here in Seattle today, are Troy Alstead, CFO, and Clifford Burrows, President of our US business. And joining us from London are Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO and John Culver, President of our Starbucks International business. Both Cliff and John will be available during our Q&A session following our prepared remarks.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10K.

Please refer to the investor relations section of Starbucks\u2019 Website at www.starbucks.com and to the financial statements accompanying the earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that are mentioned on today\u2019s call with the corresponding GAAP measures. ", "Before I turn the call over to Howard, let me highlight two up-coming events. First, we will be filing Starbucks proxy statements this Friday, January 22nd, which is associated with the second event, which is Starbucks 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, to be held at 10 am in Seattle on Wednesday, March 24th. The meeting will be available via webcast. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Howard.", "Howard Schultz ", "As part of our renewed focus on Starbucks international business, I\u2019m here in Europe for the next 10 days with John Culver, President of Starbucks International. Visiting countries where Starbucks has operations or is considering new opportunities. It\u2019s been a little bit more than two years since I returned to Starbucks as President and CEO. Very soon after my return, it became apparent to our leadership team and to me, that Starbucks would have to undergo a significant transformation in order to address the myriad of challenges confronting our business. ", "For the first time we were beginning to see traffic in our US stores slow, competitors were focusing their efforts on taking share from us and like many fast growing companies before us, we had allowed success to make us complacent. What we did not know two years ago, was that we would have to undergo this top to bottom transformation against the backdrop of the worst global economic crisis of our generation. ", "Today, I am pleased to report continued progress in our efforts to transform Starbucks and return this company to sustainable profitable growth, while at the same time remaining true to our core values and guiding principles. The numbers tell the story of and extremely strong quarter. Consolidated net revenues increased 4% to $2.7 billion. Comparable store sales increased 4% and reflected our first positive quarterly comp growth in eight quarters. Consolidated operating margin almost tripled to 13% from 4.5% in Q1of fiscal \u201909. EPS increased to $0.32 a share compared to $0.09 share in Q1 of \u201909. A new quarterly record for us despite the continued economic challenges confronting business and consumers around the world. ", "This was very satisfying quarter by any standard and follows three successive quarters of continued improvement in our business. Our US Company operated stores reached a significant milestone in Q1 as all regions reported positive comp growth and our US licensed stores also delivered strong results. As in prior quarters, our business this quarter benefited mightily from continued innovation from the success of our company wide efforts to improve customer experience from our continued laser focus on controlling operating costs and improving operating efficiency and from the impact of decisive actions we took early in 2008. ", "Today, I want to recognize and extend my heartfelt thanks to our Starbucks partners around the globe who have delivered these results. Much was asked of our partners and they have rose to the occasion time and time again. Before moving on to the business highlights of the quarter I want to make it clear that despite our strong showing we have much more work to do and we will have to perform this work in a largely uncertain and unchartered economic environment. ", "The global economic crisis has profoundly shaken consumer confidence and retailers who want to stay relevant in the future will have no choice but to recognize and respond to this new reality. At Starbucks, we know that to continue and to accelerate our recent momentum we will have to continue to improve, continue to innovate, and continue to focus on strengthening our connection to our customers. We know that our success in the past is no assurance of our success in the future. Simply stated, we know that we have to earn our business every day and we are committed to doing just that. With this unequivocally clear, let me now turn to our highlights of the quarter. Then I will turn it over to Troy to discuss the financial results in greater detail.", "Beginning with our holiday performance, our holiday performance was among the best in our history thanks to improved merchandising, a highly effective, well designed in store customer experience, compelling value offers, disciplined inventory control and above all else, energized, passionate Starbucks partners who exceeded the expectations of our customers. Our strong holiday performance continued the momentum we established in our stores during the fall with the North American launch of Starbucks VIA and as I said on our last call, we have developed new muscle in how to go to market at retail as evidenced by the fantastic customer and partner response to Starbucks VIA in our stores. ", "Our customers responded enthusiastically to all of our holiday innovations and initiatives this year. Our holiday beverage platform which this year included caramel brulee latte was a big hit, delivering 30% up lift in holiday beverage sales compared to last holiday season. We offered a relevant and more focused merchandise selection, including a selection of gifts for under $10. A Starbucks card beat sales targets with over $500 million loaded in the first fiscal quarter and our legendary Christmas sled holding coffee, a seasonal favorite, celebrating its 25th Anniversary this year not only handily beat sales targets but also sold over 300, 000 of this extraordinary blend in one single day. ", "In the quarter we also advanced our partnership with Product Red by leveraging our strong Facebook presence to connect with consumers in 156 countries for a global, virtual sing-a-long to raise money for the global fund. This effort was the largest global campaign ever on the Facebook platform and further strengthens Starbucks unique connection with our customers. I am particularly pleased to report that to date our partnership with Product Red has helped to provide over $7 million days of life saving medicine in Africa. ", "We continue to see continued improvement in our US customer satisfactions results. The measures we tracked speed of service, friendliness of our people specifically the barristers, accuracy of beverage, taste of beverage, and overall satisfaction all continue to show improvement from a year ago. Our customers continue to respond very positively to the healthier products and choices we are making available to them through our revamped food program. Tory will provide details on our continued progress toward delivering a leaner, better and more efficient operating structure. However, the improvements in our operations to date, combined with the permanent operating cost savings, we have implemented and the improvement in store traffic we are seeing gives us confidence that our US business is well positioned to continue delivering solid operating margins and income into the future. ", "In the final days of the fiscal first quarter, we launched next evolution of our customer loyalty program, My Starbucks Rewards. The program has been simplified and offers more benefits to customers based on transaction frequency. Since then, we have doubled the number of cards registered for the new program over last year and thousands of our customers are already earning their way towards highest level of rewards. ", "The company continues to be the most popular brand on Facebook, with sites now launched in 14 countries and we are the biggest brand within our category on Twitter, adding more than 1000 new followers each day. The importance of our social media expertise continues to grow, and we evolve the conversation with our core customers. Starbucks continues to be recognized for the way we\u2019re engaging and we\u2019re seeing it pay off in ways we have not anticipated. ", "In addition to the popularity of social network communities, our iPhone applications, which we launched near the end of September have been helping customers find our stores, determine nutritional information and reload their Starbucks cards. In the few months since we launched the apps we have had over 1.2 million downloads, we were featured in Apple\u2019s holiday campaign, and we were featured on iTunes as a top 10 productivity essential. Earlier this month, we were named the most popular US chain for a location based mobile application. More signs of the growing relevance of the Starbucks brand and experience. ", "In Q1, Starbucks international business showed improvement thanks largely to improved operations and execution. Here in the UK we believe we are seeing the beginnings of a turnaround with very strong growth in traffic in the quarter contributing significantly to the 4% growth in comparable sales reported by our international segment. Since last quarter, we launched a new locally relevant beverage within the UK called Flat Light, bringing innovation needed to establish cultural relevance and connection with consumers in unique ways depending on market and customer trends. ", "We also opened a new neighborhood focused store on Conduit Street in London to a very strong reception. Conduit Street is one of the latest of a series of new stores in which we are pushing the envelope in coffee innovation, design, sustainability and the overall customer experience by relying on local artisans and innovative concepts and we create further differentiation with these stores. We are also bringing in to integrating what we have learned to existing stores to upgrade or refurbish for remodels. ", "As the largest purchaser of fair trade coffee in the world, nowhere is the consumer impact more relevant than in the UK. All of our espresso based beverages are now Fair Trade certified coffee here and we have recently extended our partnership within the UK on Product Red. So, while we are off to a good start in reenergizing our UK business, we have much more work to do outside the US and the leadership team and I have identified a number of areas for improvement in our international market and global consumer products business. We are dedicated to bringing the same laser focus we brought to our US business in fiscal 2008 and 2009 to these businesses in 2010 and beyond. ", "For example, we are developing a new regional support model for our international business with an amplified focus on local relatives. France and Germany are beginning to perform better as a result of structural changes like these that we made last summer and I look forward to traveling to both countries in the next few days to meet our teams on the ground, talking to customers as we make plans in the coming months and quarters to enhance that business just like we did in the US over the last two years. Canada our oldest, and currently largest market outside the US, posted strong sales within the quarter driven by holiday offerings. The Canadian market is also benefiting from the implementation of many of the initiatives rolled out within the US which initiatives should gain further traction in the remainder of the fiscal year. In fact, we expect Canada to be one of the strongest Starbucks markets in fiscal 2010. ", "We are also focusing on China and continue to believe that China will become our largest market in the world outside the US and while we are seeing solid performance in this market we know that we are not yet remotely where we want to be or where we could be. Over the coming months, we will be in a position to tell you more about the changes we are implementing in China to better leverage and capitalize on one of the biggest opportunity the company has. ", "Our consumer products and food service division continues to be a promising business for us globally. However, our performance this quarter was somewhat disappointing and for the first time we are exploring opportunities to expand with a variety of offerings down grocery aisles domestically and internationally. Our retail launched the Starbucks VIA in North America was a highlight of Q1 bringing lots of excitement to our partners and a powerful halo to the brand. Our research has suggested that a significant percentage of customers who sample Starbucks VIA become repeat purchases and after only three months, VIA is now available in nearly 15,000 locations across the US and Canada. This includes company operated and licensed locations, Costco, Target, REI and online at Amazon.com, Cooing.com and OfficeDepot.com. ", "We followed the North American retail launch with the release of the very popular new skew and that was decaf VIA in November. Our customers have told us that their most frequent usages of VIA are in their homes or at work as a single serve option they savor for its flavor and taste and because it does not require costly, proprietary brewing equipment. Building on the broad customer acceptance through our retail channels, we are ramping up VIA launch efforts to our retail company operated stores outside of North America and poised to introduce distribution of VIA through North America and international channels in the third quarter of this fiscal year. ", "We are also planning to introduce additional premium coffee varietals and form factors to aggressively go after the at home and office single serve markets, as well as the $21 billion instant coffee category. VIA continues to excite and represent a major significant opportunity for the company. ", "Finally, as Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee, we need accelerate the growth of a significant, yet underinvested brand within our portfolio. SBC is currently in 9,000 Subway restaurants and gaining further traction in food service channels across North America. We also announced a new line of SBC branded ice latte coffee drinks that will be available in major grocery, convenience and other retail stores marking the entrance of the SBC brand into the $1.4 billion US ready to drink coffee category. Our research strongly suggests that we have an opportunity to position SBC with new customers and we plan to create compelling franchising and distribution opportunities in 2010 and beyond. We believe that SBC has the opportunity to capture new customers, position us to enter new channel to ultimately increase our overall share of the coffee market. ", "Looking ahead, continued innovation, continued enhancement of the customer experience, and stream lined, more efficient cost structure have brought Starbucks to a significant milestone and a return to profitable growth. While we are encouraged by our recent progress, we are aware of the profound economic uncertainty that exists in the world and that to continue to succeed we must continue improve, continue to innovate, and continue to maintain our laser focus on serving customers and strengthening our connection to them. ", "We also recognize that we must now apply the same rigor that enabled us to transform our US business to our international and consumer products business in order to take full advantage of the significant growth opportunities in multiple channels that exist around the world. Finally, I want to emphasize how personally proud and appreciative I am to the loyalty, the commitment, the passion and the tireless effort of our partners all over the world who have enabled us to make the kind of progress we have made in transforming the company, despite the formidable headwinds we have had to navigate within. Because of our partners, Starbucks today is a better and stronger company than it has ever been and I am more optimistic than ever about its future.", "Now, I would like to turn it over to Troy in Seattle and as I do I want to wish Tory a happy 18th anniversary with Starbucks.", "Tory Alstead ", "As Howard indicated we are very encouraged by our first quarter results building on the positive momentum created in the back half of fiscal 2009 and reaching an important milestone in the return to positive comparable store sales growth for the first time in two years. Today I will provide additional details on our fiscal first quarter performance and I will update you on our expectations for the balance of fiscal 2010 given the improving trends in the first quarter.", "First quarter revenues were $2.7 billion up 4% from $2.6 billion a year ago. The revenue increase was primarily driven by a 4% increase in comparable store sales and favorable foreign exchange offset in part by a smaller store base and softness in specialty revenues. The comp growth was attributable to a 1% increase in traffic and a 4% increase in the average value per transaction. ", "We reported consolidated operating income of $353 million in the first quarter including $18 million of restructuring charges. These restructuring charges were primarily related to lease exit and other costs associated with store closures the majority of which were in our international segment. Excluding those charges, non-GAAP operating income was $371 million. This compares to first quarter fiscal 2009 operating income of $118 million and non-GAAP operating income of $193 million. ", "Consolidated operating margin was 13.0% on a GAAP basis and 13.6% on a non-GAAP basis which represented a 620 basis point improvement from the 7.4% non-GAAP operating margin reported a year ago. In line with recent quarters we are realizing the benefits from the operational efficiencies we implemented in our business throughout fiscal 2009. These efficiencies have created additional sales leverage within our business model which became more visible this quarter with the return to positive comp growth.", "Earnings per share was $0.32 for the first quarter compared to $0.09 per share in last year\u2019s fiscal first quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.33 compared to non-GAAP EPS of $0.15 a year ago. The strength of this quarter was driven primarily by the comps store sales growth and the operational improvements we have made within the business. Of note included in this quarter\u2019s earnings was roughly $0.02 per share related to the France, Spain and Portugal transaction completed at the beginning of the quarter. That $0.02 net benefit includes an accounting gain reported in other income and a favorable impact on the effective tax rate for the quarter. This earnings favorability is strictly related to the transaction completed in the first quarter and is not reflective of ongoing financial impact from operations.", "I will now review the non-GAAP results from our operating segments beginning with the US business. Total US net revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion, a 1% increase from a year ago. Company operated US retail revenues increased 2% to $1.8 billion for the quarter primarily due to a 4% increase in comp sales offset by a reduction in the number of stores. The comp increase was driven entirely by an increase in the average value per transaction. ", "Sequential quarter same store sales trends continued the momentum from previous quarters with the one year comp improving for the fourth straight quarter and the two year comp improving for the third straight quarter and the encouraging comp performance was broad based. These trends confirm that the underlying business is healthy and that the momentum we are seeing is sustainable.", "VIA drove nearly have the increase in the average value per transaction while changes in our pricing architecture improved holiday offerings and the final leg of our warming oven roll out contributed to the remainder of the increase. Building on Howard\u2019s comments earlier about VIA, customer adoption and higher than excepted single serve at home usage has helped drive revenue beyond our expectations while cannibalization of our in store package coffee sales has been very small.", "US cost of sales including occupancy was 39.1% of revenues in the first quarter, a significant improvement of 470 basis points compared to the year ago period. Most of the improvement was the result of supply chain efficiencies, lower food costs from our redesigned food program and the implementation of in store programs that have driven measurable reductions in coffee, food and diary waste. Favorable commodity costs and sales leverage in relation to our occupancy costs have also contributed to the improvement. ", "US store operating expenses were 36.6% of total revenues, a 350 basis point improvement over last year primarily driven by the continued application of lean principles in our store operating model plus the effect of company operated store closures. I will point out here that we improved labor management and labor costs in our stores over the past year at the same time we have seen a dramatic improvement in customer satisfaction scores.", "US operating income was $342 million for the quarter, more than double last year\u2019s $165 million in operating income. The operating margin improved 910 basis points to 17.7% of related revenues from 8.6% a year ago. This quarter\u2019s US operating margin was the highest quarterly operating margin in four years. The US operating margin improvement is largely the result of the comp store sales growth as well as the work we started at the beginning of fiscal 2009 to better align our cost structure to the changing business environment.", "As a reminder, we reported $580 million in savings in fiscal \u201909 but only $75 million fell in to the first quarter with the cumulative impact growing as the year progressed. We were also lapping some significant and unusual costs from the first quarter of last year, particularly the leadership conference in New Orleans, the Starbucks card program through Costco and significant merchandise markdowns. As a result we expect our first quarter fiscal 2010 results to reflect by far the greatest year-over-year margin improvement of any quarter this year.", "The strong US results are further confirmation that the actions we have undertaken to improve the business have been successful. Another positive indicator is the strong performance of the fiscal 2009 new store age class. Based on performance to date, this age class is on track to meet our targeted two to one sales to investment ratio and to post the first positive year one profit contribution for a new store age class in the past three years.", "Moving forward in the US we will continue to execute on our three key focus areas: the customer experience; operational excellence; and relative innovation and while we are excited about the success we have had in turning the business around we recognize that opportunity still exists for improvement and that it will take a relentless focus throughout the business to have long term success in an increasingly competitive environment. We are confident in our ability to introduce innovative products and concepts and to provide our customers with an experience that is unmatched by others.", "Moving now to results in our international segment. International total net revenues increased 19% to $591 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 driven by favorable foreign currency translation, the acquisition of the France market and positive comparable store sales of 4%. The comp growth was driven by a 4% increase in traffic while the average value per transaction remained flat compared to last year. A number of international markets contributed to the solid traffic gains for the quarter with the UK, Canada and China posting the largest increases. ", "Howard\u2019s earlier remarks referenced the encouraging traffic trends in the UK. Our business in Canada, similar to the US benefitted from a strong holiday line up and China\u2019s comps have remained strong throughout the economic slowdown underscoring the increasing strength of the brand and the size of the long term opportunity in that market.", "International operating income was $54 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, a significant increase from $15 million posted last year. Operating margin improved by 610 basis points to 9.1% and finished at its highest level since the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Key drivers of the margin improvement included operational efficiencies designed to reduce waste, a smaller negative impact from store impairments, improved labor management and sales leverage. ", "The improved health of the international business is encouraging and we continue to make progress towards double digit margins in 2011 on the way to our long term mid teens target. We are focused on growing the international business in a disciplined manner utilizing the key learnings we\u2019ve obtained from our experience in the US. We will leverage the skills and expertise of the global organization while striving to offer locally relevant products and concepts in each market. The international opportunity is enormous and we are putting the appropriate resources behind it.", "Now moving to the results of the global consumer products group. GPG total net revenues decreased 4% to $197 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 primarily due to lower revenues across multiple lines of business including packaged coffee in the grocery channel and US food service. The food service revenue decline is primarily related to continued softness in the hospitality industry while the packaged coffee business continues to experience the effects of the challenging consumer environment and increasing competition. Despite the growing competition we continue to maintain a dominate position in terms of market share and we are increasing our marketing innovation spending to reinforce our category leadership and drive future growth.", "Operating income for CPG was $67 million in the first quarter, a 10% decrease from last year. The operating margin declined from 220 basis points to 34.1%. The softness in packaged coffee was a significant contributor to the margin compression and was driven primarily by increased marketing expenses and a mixed shift to the lower margin club channel versus groceries. ", "We ended the quarter in excellent financial condition with $1.4 billion in cash and short term investments, no short term borrowings outstanding and only modest long term debt on the balance sheet. As I mentioned last quarter and perhaps to head off the questions I expect to get as soon as we move in to Q&A, we continue to evaluate with our board the appropriate uses of excess cash and expect to conclude the work on our distribution strategy in the coming months. ", "The business is a very strong producer of cash flow which enables investment in our existing business, investment in new stores, investment in innovation and new growth platforms and we expect excess cash beyond those requirements that would be available to return to shareholders. Given the strong performance in the first quarter and our return to profitable sales growth, we are updating our outlook in a few key targets for the balance of fiscal 2010. ", "We now expect revenue growth to be in the mid single digits for the year driven by modestly positive comparable store sales growth, the extra week of this fiscal year and approximately 300 net new stores. While the first quarter showed measurable progress and we reached a significant milestone by generating positive comps, we are still accurately aware that the consumer faces a difficult environment with high unemployment among the many concerns. We believe this uncertain environment is still having a negative impact on our customers.", "With respect to commodities and foreign currency we except the balance of the year to be flat compared to last year with unfavorable dairy costs offset by favorable coffee costs and foreign currency. This compares to a favorable impact of roughly $0.01 in the first quarter driven by both commodities and foreign exchange. Based on first quarter trends, we now expect fiscal 2010 non-GAAP operating margin improvement of roughly 400 basis points in the US and in line with prior guidance 200 to 250 basis points in international. The operating margin from the CPG segment is expected to be approximately 35% at the low end of its recent range. All together we expect this will get us to a consolidated operating margin in the range of 11% to 12%. ", "We now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.08 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Similar to the targets we provided last quarter, this range includes roughly $0.03 per share benefit from the addition of a 53rd fiscal week and excludes roughly $0.03 in restructuring expenses mostly related to international store closings. ", "Finally, for fiscal 2010 we expect cash flow from operations to be roughly $1.5 billion and free cash flow to be approximately $1 billion. As I have stated before, earnings comparisons become more difficult as we move through the year and we begin lapping the increased cost savings and improved comp trends from last year. Additionally, we had some contribution to earnings in the first quarter that we expect will not be repeatable as we move through the year such as the non-recurring benefit from the France, Spain and Portugal transaction that I noted earlier. ", "It is also important to highlight some of the investments we will be making back in to the business later this year. With the health of the business rapidly returning, we do intend to increase spending in support of key growth platforms and initiatives which we expect will drive revenue and earnings growth in 2011 and beyond. First, fiscal 2009 was a year in which we adjusted our marketing strategy towards a broader brand building campaign. We have started to see benefits from this change in strategy including a contribution to the recently improved revenue trends.", "As a result of these learnings, we intend to significantly increase our overall market spend for the balance of the year. We estimate marketing expenditures to be roughly $0.04 per share higher in the balance of fiscal 2010 than in the last three quarters of fiscal 2009 with most of the increased spending coming in the second and third fiscal quarters and the benefits coming in Q4 and beyond. ", "It is worth noting that these increases in marketing expenses are in addition to the increase related to VIA. As I have explained in the past we do expect to spend heavily against VIA throughout the year some of which occurred in the first quarter with the North America retail launch and some of which will occur in the second and third fiscal quarters as we launch in our CPG channels. Although VIA is outperforming our expectations we still expect it to be profit neutral for fiscal 2010 as the performance upside will be allocated back in to increased marketing spend as we invest to support this critical growth platform.", "The other area where we plan to increase our investment is in our existing store portfolio to bring a refreshed look to many of our stores that will incorporate pieces of the innovative new design concepts we have highlighted on previous calls. This is an important element to the health of our brand and we believe will contribute to growth in the years ahead. As Howard mentioned earlier in his comments about the dedication of our partners, I\u2019d like to add that from a business perspective we are always focused on making the right investments. One of the most vital investments that sometimes is overlooked is the investment we make in our partners.", "Given the sequential improvement we are seeing in our business it is even more important to honor the deep commitment of our partners and business leaders. We have been able to compensate them through a discretionary match to the company\u2019s 401K savings plan, funding merit increases for eligible partners and discretionary bonuses to our field partners and business leaders. These compensation elements are important for us as a company to retain our partners and increase performance so we can continue to drive positive momentum in our business.", "We feel that these are the right investments for the future and while this will increase spending in the current year the projected long term return on investment is significant. We still have tremendous opportunities to grow the business long term and it is imperative that we invest now in order to drive profitable growth in the future. The first quarter was confirmation that the steps we\u2019ve taken to improve the business have been successful. We recognize that there are still areas for improvement and we continue to face a challenging economy and consumer environment. ", "We are confident in the strategies that we have adopted and we will continue to sharpen our focus on execution while we deepen our focus on driving growth as we move forward. With that now let me turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "I guess just towards the G&A question it looks like you grew that about 30% or so in absolute dollars. Is that fully the marketing expense also incorporated in that G&A or is that somewhat allocated across G&A but also in some of the retail stores? Then, I just wanted to be clear, you mentioned something about cards loaded in the beginning of the call over $500 million, could you put that in to relation on growth year-over-year because I think there was a spreadsheet released as of December 27th it looks like your activations are down year-over-year. I just want to know what you have as far as balances on a year-over-year basis?", "Tory Alstead ", "Let me take the G&A one first in particular and Matt it is really not particularly driven in the quarter by what you mentioned. There are two drivers that really push G&A, one is an item you\u2019ve heard me talk about before and this is the most significant thing in G&A and that is we have a deferred compensation plan and a tracking portfolio that impacts our P&L in a couple of difference places. Now, each quarter the net impact to the bottom line is zero but in this particular quarter the impact is to drive G&A costs up and that was the most significant G&A contributor to that.", "The offset to that by the way is in other income which you\u2019ll also notice was an unusually high increase in other income this quarter. That is really a complete and opposite offset to that increase in G&A. That is the single biggest item in G&A. Another component of G&A is really related to incentive compensation plans which are accruing at a higher rate given the record earnings the company reported in the quarter.", "Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Then what about the balance on the cards?", "Tory Alstead ", "The card balances were reasonably close in the quarter. We don\u2019t have specific numbers I can produce for you right now. I would remind you that last year in the first quarter we had a heavily discounted card program through Costco which was conscious decision in that first quarter of 2008 to really drive traffic in what was an extremely difficult quarter. We did not continue that program this year and so offered no discounts through the card program so we are very, very pleased we had the great reaction we did to cards even without that heavy discounting going on.", "Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "There was a headline that came across about VIA going out to the grocery stores. I was listening to the call and feverishly putting down notes but I didn\u2019t get the date when you said you were going to introduce that in to the grocery.", "Howard Schultz ", "We have not announced the date for grocery nor have we announced where internationally VIA will be. We said it will be in Q3.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ivankow \u2013 JP Morgan.", "John Ivankow \u2013 JP Morgan", "First just a quick question on VIA. When we look at the US comp I think you mentioned that a half of the price increase, in other words two points, of the comp came from VIA in the first quarter. Did I hear that correctly?", "Tory Alstead ", "It is a little bit less than two points but it is about half that increase in the average ticket was driven by VIA and just the great volumes that we sold in the quarter higher than we expected.", "John Ivankow \u2013 JP Morgan", "Just going forward Troy or Howard, when we think about VIA in fiscal 2010 do you think there is a lot of trial and there won\u2019t be as much repeat or is there room for that number to expand as we move throughout fiscal \u201910 in terms of contribution of comp?", "Howard Schultz ", "I think it is still early to be able to kind of articulate what is going to happen but I think the really positive news that we have is two things, trial leads to purchase and we also saw and that is apparent in the average ticket that the people who bought the trial size of three began to trade up to the 12 in subsequent purchases. We have no reason to believe that will change and as Troy said we\u2019re going to spend against VIA both in terms of our retail stores and the introduction at grocery because we feel that we\u2019ve got a very significant opportunity to build a major platform for the company but we have to invest spend against it.", "John Ivankow \u2013 JP Morgan", "Just a quick one also on the pricing architecture if you could remind us how many stores in effect it was in the first quarter and what you think the possible contribution of overall pricing based on the new architecture could be for fiscal \u201910?", "Tory Alstead ", "By the end of the first quarter we had rolled the revised pricing architecture across most of the US, 90% plus of our stores across the US and we\u2019ll complete that roll out really during the second quarter. What I\u2019ll point out as we talked about before John is that it is an initial rearchitecture of pricing that as you know includes many prices coming down really responding to customers\u2019 request for value and reacting to that and providing that to them in our stores, adjusting some of the more complex costly products to make up in the mix of things and that was an impact in the quarter but second or perhaps third on the list of things that impacted our average ticket.", "I will also point out that the work on pricing now continues forever. We believe we have created some competencies here and built a muscle that will allow us to continually rearchitect pricing based on value, based on customer reaction, based on particular markets and demographics that is an important new tool in our tool belt here going forward.", "John Ivankow \u2013 JP Morgan", "Several years ago when you took pricing there was an effect on value perception at the customer level. Did you experience any change in value perception with the new architecture?", "Tory Alstead ", "What we have seen with value perception this year is it actually improved. The snapshot of our customers most recently would say they believe Starbucks is offering better value today than we were a year ago and I think that is a reflection of everything we have been doing in our business in terms of how we\u2019re communicating, how we\u2019re differentiating the things that make Starbucks different so that top half of that valuation equation, not just the pricing piece of it but really the differentiating quality elements then also what we have done earlier in the year around parings, the pricing architecture which had some things going up but many, many products in every market coming down. The net effect of all of that has been an improving perception of value among our customers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I guess a question just clarification on the France, Portugal Spain deal, so it was $0.02 of onetime EPS benefit in the quarter? And, talk about the benefits going forward why you did the deal and what we might see flow through the numbers for the balance of the year on an operating basis not a onetime basis?", "Tory Alstead ", "You\u2019re right on the non-recurring element of the transaction and that was really just the painful transaction accounting relative to that acquisition. On an ongoing basis Spain adds to our top line as we consolidate the revenues from that market and is accretive to earnings overall. It is very, very small in the big scheme of our business, not something that you\u2019ll see pop through the results by any means in the short term but the most important element of that transaction that we completed was really fine tuning our international ownership to put us in a position to own and operate the markets where we see the biggest ultimate long term opportunity.", "We\u2019ve got great top line in France, we\u2019ve had great reception in the market and we believe in the long term it is a very, very significant, large and deep market for us. It is a place where it is appropriate and we can make the right investments to drive the right long term returns out of that market. That same transaction had us put in the hands of our long partner, excellent partner that we\u2019ve had on the Iberian Peninsula full ownership of Spain and Portugal which also serves our ownership strategy in the right way, smaller markets where they bring great capabilities to bear it puts them in their hands. The big benefits here in France are not so much what you\u2019ll see in fiscal \u201910 it is the long term opportunity for us to go after what we think is a big, big market.", "JoAnn DeGrande ", "Joe just to clarify Troy\u2019s initial comment, the consolidation is France not Spain.", "Howard Schultz ", "I just want to add one thing, when we look at France I think we are significantly under stored versus the opportunity and France has among the highest level of transactions throughout Europe in the system.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Sarah Sinatory \u2013 Sanford Bernstein].", "[Sarah Sinatory \u2013 Sanford Bernstein]", "I just wanted to ask you actually about the traffic versus ticket in the US, the comp coming from ticket but obviously I think we\u2019d like to see traffic as the more sustainable driver so can you talk a little bit about what you have in place to drive traffic and why you think that balance looked different in the US versus the UK?", "Clifford Burrows ", "I\u2019ll take the US comment first, we have seen over the last four quarters steady improvement in our US store traffic and that continued to the net position of flat transactions in quarter one so we are pleased with the progress so it is a trend which we obviously plan to work on continuing and the ticket Troy has talked about VIA, holiday and the work around pricing. ", "Howard Schultz ", "In international we saw as Troy said earlier, we saw the exact opposite. We saw strong transaction growth overall in our international markets across all international markets and as Tory stated it was right at 4% for the quarter.", "Tory Alstead ", "I think whether we are talking about the US business or the international business we recognize all too well that transaction as a catalyst for growth is something that we have to get. I think it is important to remind everybody we\u2019re dealing with 10% unemployment throughout America and most retailers are not only reporting down traffic but down comps so to get to this level compared to where we were a year to a year and a half ago is quite something. But we certainly recognize the vital importance of creating incrementally for traffic in 2010 and that is where our sites are set.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffery Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Jeffery Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Actually just one clarification and then a question, the clarification in terms of the cost savings I think Tory you mentioned that you were lapping the least amount of savings from a year ago. I think we had said in the past that $260 million was what was going to roll over from fiscal \u201909 in to fiscal \u201910 from those savings. I am just wondering whether you had found additional cuts? I know you said that there were likely to see additional cuts in fiscal \u201910 above and beyond the roll over. I just want to clarify that. ", "Then just separately on Seattle\u2019s Best, it seems like a great opportunity in the very early days. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give some long term color on the opportunity whether it be grocery, restaurants or actual stores in terms of market share or whether or not there is any risk to cannibalizing the core brand? How you think about growth and development of that brand over the next many years?", "Howard Schultz ", "I think as we look at the portfolio of opportunities that we have and the way in which the coffee market has evolved over the last say five to 10 years, it is clear to us that SBC is just a hidden treasure for the company in terms of its mass appeal. Starbucks coffee in terms of its taste and robustness compared to SBC, SBC is much more approachable as a flavor profile. As a result of that we think that we can distribute SBC in multiple channels of distribution where Starbucks would not be available or appropriate.", "A good example of that is what I talked about originally in my comments and that was Subway. We\u2019re talking to other QSRs about the opportunity that might exist for SBC to be available in those QSRs in which they want to go after the breakfast business not unlike what McDonalds has done. We think there is opportunities to create a franchise system for SBC and certainly a different approach to the grocery channel domestically and internationally at different price points in different kinds of coffee both in varietals lends and form factors that Starbucks would not be available in.", "These are early days. Michelle Gass one of our most senior, strongest executives in the company has had a myriad of job opportunities and has always done well is now leading that effort and what we said to her was take the shackles off SBC and grow it as if you own it and we think we\u2019re on to a very big opportunity that is much, much larger than the business today that is complementary to Starbucks and will be significant competitor to other brands that exist on the shelf today.", "Tory Alstead ", "To your cost question you are correct really in the numbers you quote. In the first quarter of last year we had reported about $75 million of our cost program which ramped up throughout the year for a total of $580 by the end of the year. Now, just those actions in 2009 gave us really a great head start in 2010. By annualizing what we did last year that results in a carryover essentially, a lapping effect really of greater than $200 million of more savings that come through the P&L this year and that has given us a real head start for those margin improvement targets and EPS growth targets that I have articulated.", "Now, in terms of finding more I will tell you we are relentlessly focused on our P&L and ways to improve it. I would not articulate it as cuts however any longer, there was some element of that in the first wave but now this is much, much more about searching for efficiencies in our massive supply chain, in procurement, in distribution, about continuing to uncover ways to be more effective in operating our stores, to reduce waste, to improve the cost structure of the company and to really turn over every rock we can in terms of efficiencies and productivity. ", "That work will continue, it will continue this year and in the years ahead. To us it is just an important additional tool in addition to innovating and driving the top line to help us offset and overcome the natural cost increases that happen through inflation on the P&L.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC.", "Sharon Zackfia \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC", "I was hoping you could maybe give us an update on the pilot of the new POS system, what the anticipated roll out of that is in the US and what you are seeing so far in terms of benefit from the new POS?", "Clifford Burrows ", "We are in the early phases of piloting this. We\u2019ve put it out in some stores close to us here in Seattle and they\u2019ve operationally now worked through that. I am delighted to say that we\u2019ve extended that to about 130 of our stores and we\u2019ve found very effective ways of deploying it and really that is a focus for us and a primary platform focus for the US retail in the coming three quarters and we\u2019re looking to have that roll out completed.", "There are many benefits to both the training and operating the system and then indeed supporting the system and the data we get from it. In terms of quantifying those benefits it really is too early but I do see benefits coming from both the partner who is operating the new system and in terms of the ease, accuracy and speed of customer service. So there will be more upside to share with you and really once we\u2019ve quantified that in coming quarters but I see the benefit coming in really FY 2011.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Kron \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kron \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "I was wondering if you guys can comment a little bit on how same store sales may have tracked through the quarter? I ask kind of in the context of your guidance for the year of modestly positive same store sales. Is there anything in your business that is giving you a little bit more of a cautionary tone specifically as it relates to VIA recognizing that sometimes when you launch a new product you may have a bit of spike based on the promotional activities surrounding that product in your stores. Can you talk a little bit about how things tracked at least directionally throughout the quarter? ", "Then just a follow up question on the margins if I can, it looks like you carried a lot of overage you saw in the first quarter to your increase in operating margin guidance of 400 basis points for the US, didn\u2019t seem like you carried over overage from the international business which I suspect was probably better than expected at least internal projections. Can you talk a little bit about what might be an offset?", "Howard Schultz ", "I\u2019d like to take the comp question if you don\u2019t mind and you can answer the later. I think we don\u2019t want to get in to the sequential growth of the quarter in terms of comps. It maintained a level of consistency throughout the quarter. I think the modest guidance that we want to give on comps I think is the absolute right approach given the high level of uncertainty in the economy and the strong level of unemployment that exists and could get greater. So I think we still have a lot to prove, these are still early days.", "The kind of comp quarter that we posted, the first comp positive in eight quarters does not make a trend and we want to be very careful in how we\u2019re providing guidance being highly thoughtful and disciplined in our approach.", "Tory Alstead ", "Then to the question about the margins and international in particular international did have a great first quarter there is no question. The improvement in margin was very, very strong and we\u2019re very pleased by how we\u2019re getting closer to that next milestone for us which will be double digits on the way to our long term target of getting that business in to the mid teens. We also recognize as you\u2019ve heard from us before that this year is largely about international to a great degree where we have focused heavily in the last two years on restructuring and transforming our US business we\u2019re seeing the results of that payoff tremendously for us.", "Now, we\u2019re turning that same level of focus and attention to international which means there may be as we concurrent with driving improving margins in the business we may be making some investments back in to that business just as a year and a half and two years ago we made investments in to the US. That is what leads us to what we think is a very quite strong and solid margin improvement for the year of 200 to 250 basis points but moderated and reflective of our interest to improve the business at the same time that we heavily invest against it for the long term opportunity that we see ahead of us there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer \u2013 UBS.", "David Palmer \u2013 UBS", "A question on the sales mix and particularly on brewed coffee, how much has your brewed coffee increased as a percent of your sales mix over the last year, maybe a little longer if you want to go two years? And to the degree that brewed is increasing how much of that do you think is really getting the same folks that might have been having other espresso based beverages to trade down to brew rather than trade out during tough economic times or are you perhaps attracting new users to the brand?", "Tory Alstead ", "What I would say to that is if you look over the last year or two our mix of brewed coffee has not changed meaningfully. Occasionally perhaps around the edges a bit here and there but it has not been a big trend that I would tell you about in the business so I don\u2019t think that is a particularly meaningful thing to speak to. We\u2019ve always said as over the past year we\u2019ve looked at our business and tried to understand impacts on the business trade down was not a meaningful element that we could find in the business. We\u2019ve analyzed it everywhere we can and there probably was some of it but it was just not something that jumped out in particular.", "It has always been about largely preserving a core customer, a core Starbucks customer but losing some of their frequency. Much of our efforts in the past year of rebuilding that trust and that relationship with customers has been about regaining frequency but again, without material or substantial changes particularly in that brewed coffee mix.", "Clifford Burrows ", "Just to share what we have focused on is the quality in the cup, the freshness and availability of our brewed coffee. So in terms of certainly the relationship with the brewed coffee customer and their satisfaction with both the availability and the freshness of the coffee in the cup we\u2019ve had great positive feedback on that. And, as we shared about a year ago our key focus was around retaining our existing customers. We recognized that the competition had grown in the market and we reset our standards and we\u2019ve delivered against that to essentially maintain our customers and make sure we satisfy them when they come in to our stores.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley. ", "John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Could you talk about the learning specifically that you plan on taking from the US in to the international markets? Is it as simple as taking the playbook that you had in international and applying it to each market or is it somewhat unique problems in each market or unique opportunities? And, can you do it all at once or do you have to address a single market at a time? It sounds like you\u2019ve worked on Canada do you do it in that order or can you go at everything at once in 2010?", "Howard Schultz ", "Let me start and I will give it to Troy and perhaps John will chime in as well. I think one thing that you need to realize is that 18 months ago the entire company\u2019s focus, the leadership team and certainly my priority personally was restoring the health and strength of the US business and the focus and the attention and the transformation took a comprehensive effort of basically the entire company. As a result of that we did not pay as much attention and certainly as much focus on the international business as we did on the US, we just didn\u2019t have enough resources.", "Now that the US business has come back the way it is and we feel it is healthy and on solid ground we\u2019re doing two things, one is we\u2019re doing a comprehensive audit of all the things that we did in the US business that worked, that got our customers back, that put lean in our store and things that not only were consumer facing but also behind the customer as well. What you said was appropriate, there is not one international there are many, many different countries with different complex issues, different ownership structures but a store, is a store, is a store and we believe that we can provide many of the opportunities throughout international that we brought to the US business.", "I think one thing is just focus as we did on the US business on international. The fact that I am here with John and visiting the European countries and we\u2019re going to shift our focus to the international market should be a very strong signal that we are intent on leveraging the strength of the business on to international. We do think that we can do multiple countries in multiple regions at once but this is not going to happen overnight it is a journey and it is going to take a while for it to emulate the kind of numbers that we posted in the US business.", "But, there isn\u2019t one international. We have some markets that are very, very strong and some that are under pressure because of the local economy like in western Europe and then some markets like Asia, specifically China where we\u2019ve got very strong comps and very strong profitability at the unit level.", "Tory Alstead ", "I think the only thing Howard I would add and perhaps underscore a bit is if you go back two years ago when we really began this work in the US the first and foremost focus was very heavily around the customer, the customer experience in store, the elevation of the product and the product quality and our partner experience. Of course we\u2019ve consistently also moved in to managing the P&L and disciplines around growth but I think first and foremost remembering that focus on the customer as we bring those lessons to bear outside of the US is critically important. ", "Then, disciplines around new store growth, focus on unit economics, the cost to build stores, store profitability, driving same stores sales again, I think the bread and butter of a retail business like ours but those things that were perhaps a bit lacking in the focus and ability to manage a couple of years ago are now very accurately focused on them in the US and bringing that to bear in the UK, in Canada, in China and so on. That\u2019s where we see the opportunity over time.", "Howard Schultz ", "I think the headline I would just close with is in 50 countries outside of the US the Starbucks experience, the sense of community, the third place and the relationship with our partners demonstrates the high degree of relevancy of the Starbucks experience. Where here in the UK, we\u2019re serving over two million customers a week, we have a high level of transactions in France and I mentioned other countries as well. We\u2019ve cracked the code on the ability of the Starbucks brand and Starbucks store experience to be accepted.", "Now, we have to elevate the customer experience and do the kind of work behind the scenes and the cost structure, the expense control and the kind of marketing that makes us highly relevant on a local level. But, we\u2019ve got great upside here not only in our stores but most importantly on a complementary basis to bring the consumer products group in to the international business and in some cases you might see us do it ahead of or in parallel with store growth which would be a strategic change for the company", "JoAnn DeGrande ", "Thank you all for joining us today.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.  After the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer session.  (Operator Instructions)  Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "", "This is JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations at Starbucks Coffee Company.  With me in Seattle today are Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; Troy Alstead, CFO; and John Culver, President of our International business.  Before we get started I would like to remind you that this conference call will be containing forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factors discussions in our filings with the SEC including our last annual report on Form 10K.", "Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.  Please refer to the investor relations section of Starbucks\u2019 website at www.Starbucks.com and to the financial statements of the company and the earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call along with our corresponding GAAP measures.  ", "With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Howard Schultz.", "Howard Schultz ", "The second quarter results we announced today demonstrate the success of our efforts over the last two years to dramatically transform Starbucks\u2019 business and to position the company for sustained profitable growth in to the future.  I am pleased to report that our Q2 results reflect the strong underlying fundamentals of our business and the significant improvements in revenues, comp store sales, operating performance, margins and earnings per share that we sought to achieve.", "Our top to bottom transformation has created new discipline throughout our company and a solid foundation from which to grow.  Starbucks today enjoys a leaner, vastly more efficient operating structure, increased operating leverage, a highly relevant pipeline of innovative new product offerings both in the market and yet to be introduced, powerful marketing muscle, a deeper, stronger connection with an increasingly more satisfied customer base and a renewed passionate, committed 200,000 partner work force in 52 countries around the world.", "We\u2019ve learned valuable lessons over the last few years and we are now sharing and integrating these lessons in order to improve our operations across the global.  Global retail expansion in the future will be achieved by combining our coffee leadership position with cost discipline and operational excellence as unequivocal prerequisites.  We have created an innovative differentiated model to adapt to the changing rules of engagement in traditional marketing and have embraced social networks and digital media as part of an ongoing 360 degree conversation with our customers all over the world.", "The success of these efforts has resulted in our becoming the number one brand on Facebook and one of the leading brands on Twitter.  We have infused this digital mindset in to all of our marketing and communications to leverage our already effective brand voice enabling a powerful, highly relevant low cost customer acquisition vehicle and we will continue to innovate and strive to be best of class in all aspects of our business internationally and domestically.  ", "We\u2019ve also refined our longer term strategy beyond the retail experience and can now offer consumers innovative new coffee products in multiple brands, form factors and across new and established categories, formats and channels.  Taken together, these efforts and initiatives represent a strategy that we believe will provide us with a run way for disciplined profitable growth long in to the future.  ", "The results for Q2 exceeded our expectations in many ways and let me just touch on a few.  Consolidated net revenues increased 9% to $2.5 billion.  US comparable store sales increased 7% driven by a 3% increase in traffic and a 5% increase in average ticket.  Importantly, this is the first quarter in 13 in which we saw a return to traffic growth in our US stores.  International comparable store sales also increased 7% driven by a 6% increase in traffic and a 1% increase in average ticket. ", "Reported consolidated operating margin increased to 13.4% from 1.8% in Q2 of the prior year.  EPS for the quarter increased to $0.28 per share up from $0.03 per share in the same period last year.  Increasing business momentum over the last four quarters and the operating leverage inherent in our business model have also enabled us to generate a very strong cash flow which we are investing against our global growth strategy.  At the same time, we are able now to return cash to shareholders in the form of a quarterly dividend and have increased the number of shares authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase plan.", "Together, these programs reflect the strength of Starbucks business today and the confidence we have in the growth and health of Starbucks\u2019 business over the long term.  Before turning the call over to Troy to discuss in detail the financial results of the quarter, let me share some segment highlights with you from my own perspective.  Our US business has been completely transformed under the stewardship of Cliff Burrows and his excellent field leadership team and performed well ahead of expectations.", "In fact, despite continuing economic headwinds, Q2 turned out to be a record second quarter in our history for our US segment with revenues up 5%, comp store sales up 7%, a non-GAAP operating margin of 17% and an operating income up 80% to $323 million.  Traffic growth in our US business is being driven by significant qualitative improvements in key customer metrics with scores in the areas of speed of service, accurateness, friendliness, taste of beverage and overall satisfaction all rising appreciably, a continuing trend that began last year.", "Two years ago we asked our partners to elevate the Starbucks experience in all of our stores and they have responded with passion and enthusiasm.  Once again, Starbucks\u2019 success is a direct reflection of our partners\u2019 dedication and commitment.  Let me turn your attention to our new loyalty program.  The My Starbucks reward program has been an overwhelming success, driving unprecedented levels of customer engagement and loyalty as noted by both store visit frequency and cash loaded. ", "In fact, the rewards program is cited by core customers as the number one reason for increased visits versus six months ago.  Since relaunching the program in December, registered card users have shown a significant increase in frequency with continued steady ticket performance.  Card reloads were up nearly 45% this quarter versus Q2 \u201909 driven largely by reloads on the new gold level card and since the program launched in December we\u2019ve added over one million new accounts.", "In addition, more than 200,000 customers have earned their way to gold level by visiting Starbucks 30 times in just eight weeks illustrating the tremendous traffic driving power of the card and the ongoing loyalty of our customers.  Early this month we expanded our Starbucks card mobile payment, a test to 1,000 of our licensed locations in Target stores nationwide allowing card members to load their cards and pay for their Starbucks purchases using their iPhones.  Stay tuned for further announcements of important consumer facing initiatives that will enable us to leverage mobile payment and other technologies that are ready made for the Starbucks brand in the months ahead.", "A clear highlight of the quarter was our ongoing bold coffee promotion, an eight week campaign offering our customer their favorite proprietary Starbucks bold coffee in an engaging way to track their journey with a coffee passport, reaffirming our coffee authority and leadership position it the market place.  We\u2019ve also refreshed our coffee advertising in digital campaigns to emphasize value, quality and differentiation that we offer our customers in our retail stores and in our ongoing growing CPG presence.  The promotion is reigniting coffee passion with both our partners and customers, elevating our brand and serving as a key transaction driver for increasing brewed coffee sales.", "The launch of warm panini\u2019s in the US and a new healthy snack platform are helping to drive increased sales and incrementality during key day parts.  We will continue our efforts to improve quality of food and deliver healthier choices for our customers.  Over the last 18 months, we\u2019ve continued to build a closer connection and an ongoing communication with our customers by addressing issues really relevant to them.  ", "Our latest initiative, rewarding customers for bringing their own tumblers brought more traffic in to our stores while raising consciousness about the issues of recycling, waste and environmental stewardship.  We deployed our store partners as well as media, digital and communication channels to drive the initiative providing our customers with a tangible way to celebrate earth month with us.  Significantly, this was a global event with stores in over 50 countries participating.  ", "As some of you may remember, we conducted our January earnings call from London.  We were in the UK because with our US business strengthening the time has come for us to refocus our efforts and our attention on the tremendous growth and profit opportunities that exist for Starbucks around the world.  Since then John Culver, President of Starbucks international and I have traveled to Europe, to the UK for the successful launch of Starbucks VIA and throughout many countries in Asia as we bring the learnings from the transformation of the US business to our operations in every country in which we compete.", "Though we only have one quarter or so of impact of these efforts behind us, the results to date are very encouraging and I\u2019d like John to share some of the highlights of the progress we are making in key international markets.  Let me introduce to you John Culver.", "John Culver ", "Starbucks Coffee International represents an enormous opportunity for Starbucks as we applied the same rigor, discipline and energy that have enabled us to transform the US business to all of our markets around the world.  As Howard indicated, the results to date have been very encouraging.  Second quarter revenues were up 23%, comp sales were up 7%, non-GAAP operating margin increased significantly to 8.9% and operating income more than doubled to $48 million.  ", "Given the progress we are seeing, we expect our international business to reach sustainable double digit profit margins beginning in our fiscal 2011.  While we are very pleased with this quarter\u2019s performance, I can assure all of you that no one on the international team is close to taking any victory laps.  Quite to the contrary, we are heads down and sleeves rolled up addressing the critical issues in identifying key opportunities market by market so that we can great even more momentum in our global business in the months and quarters ahead.", "With stores in 51 countries internationally, our focus this year is to drive depth in several key markets with stronger partnerships and locally relevant innovation.  Troy will discuss the international financial results with you in greater detail shortly but, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to call out a few highlights of the business and performance for you now.  ", "Our Canadian business performed exceptionally well in the quarter benefitting from the Olympic games in Vancouver and several highly effective transformational initiatives introduced by the team to drive increased traffic and improve overall operating efficiencies.  UK comps remain positive and we are seeing continued momentum and incrementality following the successful introduction of Starbucks VIA in to all of our stores throughout the UK.", "The training that surrounded the introduction of our new flat white beverage has improved the quality of our espresso in the UK overall and several competitors in the UK are now attempting to play catch up in our wake.  We are also seeing strong consumer reception to our fair-trade partnership across the UK, France, Germany and throughout Europe and are maintaining our focus on operational rigor and the development and introduction of improved food programs in each of these markets.", "As Howard mentioned, we just returned from a four country trip to Asia, a trip that reaffirmed our view of the fantastic opportunity that Asia represents for Starbucks.  The foundation of our growth is our partners and we were once again blown away by the passion and quality of our partners in Seoul, Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong.  During our visit, we celebrated Starbucks 10th anniversary in Hong Kong and in a terrific visit to Shanghai saw firsthand the excitement of our Shanghai partners and the hard work in which they are engaged as they prepare to host visitors for the World Expo in May.", "Our growing presence in both greater China and the Asia Pacific region represent significant opportunities for us.  We will continue to pursue thoughtful, disciplined and profitable growth in China, a market we believe will ultimately become the largest market for Starbucks outside of the US.  Our plan includes rapid, targeted expansion, the introduction of locally relevant innovations such as our China grown, south of the clouds blend coffee, Starbucks tea and further development of cross channel opportunities within our CPG business.", "I am particularly pleased to report that our profitable China retail business again delivered strong comp growth during the second quarter.  We have a very clear line of sight to the opportunities in our international markets and we are poised to make significant progress over the coming months as we focus our efforts and intentions on the tremendous growth opportunities that exist for Starbucks globally.", "With that, let me now turn it back over to Howard.", "Howard Schultz ", "As John said, Starbucks is in many ways just beginning to scratch the surface of the enormous potential we have around the world.  I would like to share a few of the areas in which our learning is being applied globally.  First, we continue to see a terrific response to our newly highly differentiated store designs in Paris Disney, Tokyo, Conduit Street in the UK and Seattle among other places.  Over the next 12 to 18 months we will bring the learning from new store design initiatives to a very aggressive phase of existing store remodels and refurbishments in the US.", "We recently reopened our Spring Street store in Soho and for those New Yorkers on the call, I encourage you to drop by to see firsthand how we are integrating new designs in to our existing store base and significantly elevating the customer experience.  On our recent trip to Tokyo, Shanghai and Hong Kong we saw firsthand how these new design elements integrated in to refurbishments in these markets with a strong customer response.  ", "At the same time, we are creating new stores, new destination stores in these markets through creative designs such as those incorporated in to stores like Duddell Street in Hong Kong, Pudong in China and [Jaboya] in Japan.  Another way we are leveraging our learning among US in international markets is reflected in our approach to the global launch of Starbucks VIA.  ", "After successfully launching VIA in the US, Canada and the UK, last week we went after a very big prize Japan.  The at home market in Japan is a $5 billion market half of which is instant that hasn\u2019t had much innovation in over 50 years.  Last week John and I participated in truly a fantastic launch of VIA in Japan in which we incorporated all the learnings from the prior launches and leveraged best in class digital media and integrated marketing and promotional campaign and passionate store partners to create sampling and a taste challenge localized and highly relevant for the Japanese customer.", "The results have been extraordinary.  VIA has been a huge hit in Japan and we have significantly over performed against our sales projections.  We are convinced we have a big winner with VIA in Japan.   VIA continues to exceed our expectations in every market we have launched and we remain extremely excited about VIA\u2019s prospects in the future as we add new markets during the coming year.  ", "Our global consumer products business, CPG, represents another important growth vehicle for Starbucks as we accelerate both product innovation and distribution.  Starbucks VIA is becoming an increasingly significant platform for us with the CPG channel roll out having begun towards the end of Q2.  We now plan to expand to more than 30,000 points of distribution by the end of Q3 and look forward to offering new form factors in other innovations in the very near term for all things VIA.", "The VIA rollout will be supported by a nationwide US advertising and marketing campaign, both print and broadcast designed to support the positive customer reaction we continue to experience in our stores.  We\u2019re beginning to see improvement in our US packaged coffee business and are increasing the capabilities of our CPG business globally.  In January, we announced our entry in to the ready to drink RTD coffee category in Europe, a $550 million market and earlier this month we launched Starbucks Discoveries chilled coffees and Starbucks Double Shot Espresso Milk drink in UK grocery and convenience stores.", "Also this month we began offering Starbucks Double Shot Espresso drinks to consumers in Hong Kong.  In addition, we are making significant progress with Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee.  By the end of the year with Burger King, Subway and Max Convenience Stores, a Canadian company now offering SBC as part of their breakfast program, we will be expanding from 3,000 to 30,000 places where customers can get a cup of Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee.   ", "In fact, you may have seen Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee on TV or billboards as part of the feature part of the new national Subway ad campaign.  Building a strong retail footprint continues to be part of our strategy utilizing a franchise go to market model.  We are very encouraged by the deep pipeline we are building and are getting high marks from perspective franchisees as we leverage our coffee and operational expertise.  SBC is also now offering its first line of ready to drink ice latte coffee drinks in the US through major grocery, convenience and other retail stores initially in the west coast.", "Looking ahead, Starbucks growth will come through continued expansion of our domestic and international retail store base and through growth in complimentary channels of distribution.  We\u2019ve adopted a discipline approach to profitable growth in the US and we will accelerate growth of our international businesses by embracing and sharing the learning from our US transformation.  We will continue to bring significant breakthrough innovation in order to build on our coffee authority and enhance our leadership position around the world.  ", "Finally, I would like to just from my heart thank all of our Starbucks partners for the strong results we reported today.  Our partners once again demonstrated their resiliency and their commitment to our company and most importantly to our customers.  While we are gratified and encouraged by today\u2019s results, we know we have much more work to do but we also know the strength of our business and dedication and hard work of our partners ideally positions us to continue to achieve profitable growth well in to the future.", "Now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Troy to go through the financials.", "Tory Alstead ", "As Howard indicated, this was an outstanding quarter by almost any measure and underscores the success of the company\u2019s transformation over the past two years.  Building on the momentum created in the back half of fiscal 2009, we generated the highest second quarter earnings and operating margin ever recorded in the company\u2019s 39 year history.  This record performance is driven by a significant move back in to comparable store sales growth and by improved operational efficiencies which created powerful sales leverage.", "Today I will provide additional details on our fiscal second quarter performance.  Then, I will update you on our expectations for the balance of fiscal 2010 given the ongoing improvement in the trajectory of our business.  Second quarter revenues were $2.5 billion, up 9% from $2.3 billion a year ago.  The revenue increase was primarily driven by a 7% increase in comparable store sales and favorable foreign exchange partially offset by a smaller store base.  ", "The 7% comp growth was the strongest comp we\u2019ve seen in four years and was attributable to a 3% increase in traffic and a 4% increase in the average value per transaction.  We reported consolidated operating income of $340 million in the quarter including $8 million of restructuring charges.  These restructuring charges were related to lease exit and other costs associated with store closures, nearly all of which were in our international segment.", "Excluding those charges, non-GAAP operating income was $348 million. This compares to second quarter fiscal 2009 operating income of $41 million and non-GAAP operating income of $193 million.  Consolidated operating margin was 13.4% on a GAAP basis and 13.7% on a non-GAAP basis which represented a 540 basis point improvement compared to last year and set an all time record for our fiscal second quarter.", "In line with recent quarters, we are realizing the benefits from the operational efficiencies which we implemented in our business throughout fiscal 2009 and which we continue to refine in 2010.  As noted earlier, these efficiencies have created additional sales leverage within our business model which has become more visible with the return of comp sales growth last quarter and the acceleration of that growth this quarter.  ", "Earnings per share was $0.28 for the second quarter compared to $0.03 per share in last year\u2019s fiscal second quarter.  Non-GAAP EPS was $0.29 compared to non-GAAP EPS of $0.16 a year ago.  I will now review the non-GAAP results from our operating segments beginning with the US business.  Total US net revenues were the quarter were $1.8 billion, a 5% increase from a year ago. Company operated US retail revenues increased 5% to $1.7 billion for the quarter, primarily due to a 7% increase in comp sales offset in part by a reduction in the number of stores.", "The comp increase was driven by a 3% increase in transactions and a 5% increase in the average value per transaction.  The 3% increase in transactions marked an important milestone, the first time in 13 quarters we\u2019ve had positive year-over-year traffic.  This transaction increase is highly correlated with the notable improvement in our customer satisfaction scores over the past year.  Also as Howard noted, the new Starbucks reward program launched at the start of the quarter, is driving increased frequency among registered card holders.  Account registrations, dollars loaded to the cards and redemptions are each up significantly over last year.", "With respect to the increase in average value per transaction, the changes we\u2019ve made to our pricing architecture drove roughly one third of the increase while both VIA and the final leg of our warming program rollout also contributed to the increase.  Sequential quarter comp trends continued the momentum from past quarters with the one year comp trend improving for the fifth straight quarter and the two year comp trend improving for the fourth straight quarter.  ", "The improvement was also broad based day parts, regions and product categories.  US cost of sales including occupancy was 38.9% of revenues in the second quarter, a significant improvement of 320 basis points compared to the year ago period.  Most of the improvement was the result of lower food costs from our redesigned food program, supply chain efficiencies and the implementation of in store programs that have driven measureable reductions in coffee, food and dairy waste.  Sales leverage in relation to our occupancy costs also contributed to the improvement.  ", "US store operating expenses were 36.2% of total revenues, a 340 basis point improvement over last year.  The majority of this improvement was attributable to sales leverage, the closure of underperforming stores and the continued application of lean principles in our store labor deployment.  Lower benefit expenses related to health and welfare programs which tend to vary from quarter-to-quarter also contributed to the improvement.  ", "As a result of the lean work to date, productivity and customer satisfaction have both improved dramatically compared to last year.  We continue to refine these important activities as many of them are customer facing.  In addition, we have other initiatives underway such as a new labor scheduling tool and a new point of sale system that we expect will further increase productivity once fully implemented.  ", "US operating income was $323 million for the quarter, an 80% increase compared to last year.  The operating margin improved 740 basis points to 17.8% of related revenues from 10.4% a year ago.  This quarter\u2019s operating margin set a second quarter record for the US operating segment and it was on par with our fiscal first quarter operating margin which is typically the highest of the year due to the holiday season.  ", "The impressive US operating margin results are due to the work we started at the beginning of fiscal 2009 to better align our cost structure to the changing business environment and to become a more efficient operator at the store level.  This work has also allowed us to capitalize on the strength we\u2019ve seen in comp store sales growth as the better operating leverage now translates in to more dollars flowing through to operating profit.  ", "The progress made over the last two years to transform the US business is particularly satisfying given the extent of the challenges we faced during that time.  The financial results speak for themselves but importantly these results have been achieved as customer satisfaction scores have improve more than at any point in our history.  Customer satisfaction metrics along with other positive indicators such as new store performance, provide us with confidence that we made the right decisions for the long term health of the business and that the improvement we are seeing is real and sustainable.", "The US segment is critical to the overall well being of Starbucks and now that it is healthy and highly profitable again, we\u2019re able to focus more attention on areas such as the international business which I will now discuss.  International total net revenues increased 23% to $534 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 driven by favorable foreign currency translation, positive comparable store sales of 7% and the acquisition of the France market at the beginning of the fiscal year.", "The comp growth was driven by a 6% increase in traffic and a 1% increase in the average value per transaction.  Similar to last quarter, a number of international markets contributed to the solid comp gains with Canada, the UK and China having the most significant impact.  Also encouraging, this quarter\u2019s two year comp of 4% is the best two year comp growth in six quarters. ", "International operating income was $48 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, more than double the $21 million posted in last year\u2019s comparable period.  Operating margin improved by 410 basis points to 8.9%, easily setting a second quarter record for the international segment.  Key drives of the margin improvement included reduced food costs, sales leverage in relation to occupancy and strong operational performance from our largest joint venture markets.", "The continued improvement in the international business is very encouraging as we progress to a double digit margin target in 2011 on the way to our long term mid teens target.  Starbucks have a very small share of the global coffee market and with roughly one third of our current global store base and the potential capacity for much more, we recognize the enormous international opportunity in front of us.  We also understand the need for excellent execution and delivery of the Starbucks experience, locally relevant products and store designs and strong relationships with key strategic partners across the globe.  Recognizing these factors, our focus as a management team is to position the international business to profitably capture an increasing share of the global coffee market.  ", "I\u2019ll now move on to the results in the global consumer products group.  CPG total net revenues increased 4% to $180 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 while operating income increased 8% to $68 million for the quarter.  The result was an operating margin increase of $110 basis points to 37.6%.  The increase in both revenues and the operating income are primarily due to VIA and the Subway SBC launch which was announced earlier this fiscal year.  The VIA impact is partially due to sales in to grocery as we are in the very early stages of filling this channel of the broader third quarter launch and marketing campaign.  ", "I will provide an update on our overall outlook for the balance of fiscal 2010 in a moment but I wanted to take this opportunity to elaborate more on the CPG segment in particular.  As we move through the balance of the year in CPG, we expect to see accelerated revenue growth in relation to the second quarter driven by both VIA and the SBC QSR expansion.  However, we do not expect the year-over-year operating income growth that we recorded in the second quarter to continue as we will be investing heavily in two areas.", "First, we will officially launch VIA in to the grocery channel in the third quarter and there will be significant levels of advertising to support that launch, much of which will not pay off until later periods.  Second, we plan to continue to invest more in to our packaged coffee business in order to protect market share as that business has become increasingly competitive.  Recent investments in to packaged coffee are starting to show results already as February and March Neilsen data showed year-over-year market share gains for the first time since March 2007.", "While these two areas of investment will suppress CPG margins in the near term, they are necessary to build on Starbucks coffee leadership and to support the growth of this high margin business segment. As Howard mentioned, Starbucks announced its first ever dividend at our annual shareholder meeting in late March initiated as a quarterly distribution of $0.10 per share with the first payment scheduled for this Friday.  We have targeted a 35% to 40% payout ratio going forward.  At that time we also announced a resumption of our share repurchase program with 15 million newly authorized shares bringing the total for repurchase to 21 million shares.  To date we have not executed any buybacks out of this pool due to our quarterly blackout period.", "Both the dividend and share repurchase programs are strong signals of the financial health of the company which has never been stronger than it is today.  And, they reinforce our commitment to thoughtful, disciplined growth.  There are abundant profitable growth opportunities ahead for Starbucks and the powerful cash flow that we generate will allow us to go after those opportunities while still returning cash to our shareholders.  We believe this is part of our evolution in to a more diversified growth company and that investors will benefit from this multipronged approach to shareholder returns.", "Given the improving trajectory of our comparable store sales growth and the significant flow through on those sales, we\u2019re updating our outlook in a few key targets for the balance of fiscal 2010.  We now expect mid single digit revenue growth over the comparable 52 week period and high single digit revenue growth with the inclusion of a 53rd week driven by a mid single digit comparable store sales growth.  ", "We have been pleased by the resiliency of our customers in the first half of this fiscal year.  With that said, we are still aware of the pain that many face given stubbornly high unemployment, rising gas prices and continued problems in the housing markets.  We have become more confident in the potential for recovery and we\u2019re clearly seeing some signs of it in our business.  But, we also recognize that there are several risks that still exist and continue to create an uncertain future for the economy.", "We now expect fiscal 2010 non-GAAP operating margins of 15% to 17% in the US segment and 8% to 10% in the international segment.  We continue to expect the operating margin from the CPG segment to be approximately 35% in line with our prior outlook.  All together, we expect this will get us to a consolidated non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 12% to 13%.  We now expect earnings per share to be in a range of $1.19 to $1.22 per share on a non-GAAP basis.  This range includes roughly $0.04 per share benefit in Q4 from the addition of a 53rd fiscal week and excludes roughly $0.03 in restructuring expenses mostly related to international store closings.", "Finally, for fiscal 2010, we expect cash flow from operations to be at least $1.5 billion and free cash flow to be more than $1 billion.  As I have stated before, earnings comparisons become more difficult as we move in to the back half of the fiscal year and lap significantly higher incremental cost savings and better comp trends from fiscal 2009.  Also, as I pointed out on the first quarter earnings call, we\u2019re making significant investments back in to the business as we move through the balance of fiscal 2010, including increased investment in marketing, in our partners and in our existing store base.", "With respect to the marketing expenses, our outlook on last quarter\u2019s call included a significant investment over the balance of the year with much of this in the second and third quarters.  In fact, we ultimately shifted much of that expected investment in second quarter marketing spend in to the third quarter which provided some benefit to our Q2 results compared to our expectations.  ", "For the remainder of the year, we now expect the incremental marketing expenditure to be roughly $0.05 per share compared to the last two quarters of fiscal 2009 with the majority of the increase coming in the third quarter in support of the customizable frappuccino rollout and the VIA launch in the broader CPG channels.  ", "With respect to VIA we now expect a slightly positive contribution to profit for the full fiscal year based on the strong performance year-to-date.  As I mentioned earlier, we plan to aggressively launch VIA in to our traditional CPG channel during the third quarter supported by that significant marketing investment.  As a result of the planned third quarter marketing expenditures, combined with the addition of an extra week in the fourth quarter, we expect stronger margins in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter.", "We continue to believe that these are the right investments for the future health of the business.  While the impact suppresses this year\u2019s results, the potential long term return is significant.  The second quarter was an outstanding quarter but we continue to believe that the best days for Starbucks lay ahead of us.  With a reinvigorated and healthy US business as a foundation, the stage is set for profitable growth ahead.", "We will continue to execute our plan in the US focusing on the customer experience, operational excellence and delivering innovative products.  Internationally, we\u2019re intensely focused on improving the health of that portfolio in much the same manner as we improved the US and on capitalizing on the enormous expansion possibilities that exist abroad.  ", "Finally, outside of the traditional store channels we are aggressively pursuing significant opportunities to take great coffee to more customers in more places with products such as VIA and our complimentary SBC brand.  With that, now let me turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "A bigger picture question, as you look out over the next few years, where do you see the greatest growth coming from of your three major segments?  That is to say domestic, international and CPG, can you talk about where the incremental growth is coming from in each of those segments as you map it out?  And, as part of the answer, I think VIA will be mentioned.  Can you talk about where VIA sales are today or give us a sense of where you think those should be by the end of this fiscal year?", "Howard Schultz ", "I think John as we indicated on the call, I think there\u2019s a number of things going on with regard to the growth of the company.  We still believe that there is a fair amount of growth domestically but we\u2019re going to take the next 12 to 18 months to focus on refurbishing a significant amount of the portfolio given the fact that we see incrementality in some of the remodels that we\u2019ve gone through already. But clearly, the lion\u2019s share of the growth of the company on the long term basis is international retail stores and specifically looking at the core footprint today, that has to be Asia and the number one market is going to be China.", "When we were in China last week and we were talking to some of the journalists we also mentioned that there are two markets that we are not in that we are intrigued by and that\u2019s India and Vietnam.  But, in addition to that we now believe that we have a go to market strategy leveraging the retail footprint of our store base to go to the CPG channel in a unique way.  What I mean by that specifically is I think VIA is a great case study for the outside world to kind of model in terms of what we\u2019re capable of doing and that is introducing a new product or sub brand in our retail stores, gaining awareness, gaining trial and ultimately loyalty and as a result of that benefitting from the core base of customers using it, in this case VIA and then taking it to the grocery channel.", "The grocery channels are responding to VIA in a unique way and that is because of the margin opportunities and the momentum built in from our retail stores, it\u2019s being embraced by that channel in a unique fashion unlike other new products.  We think we can do that countless times domestically and we\u2019re beginning to build a competency to do that internationally.  So this is the beginning of leveraging our retail store footprint to benefit the CPG business and at the same time significantly focusing on the learning and transformation that we have gone through in the US and applying it with great rigor and discipline on our international business and taking advantage of the core business we now have in China that is profitable and the customer base is local Chinese which makes us very, very happy.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC.", "Sharon Zackfia \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC", "I\u2019m intrigued by what you were saying about the refurbishment program in the US, so maybe if you can give us some more parameters around how many stores are you looking to touch?  Are these like the normal refreshes that we would see but just with a more kind of comprehensive look to them?  And, what you\u2019ve seen kind of in the past when you\u2019ve done these refurbishments which I guess is a relatively new program.", "Clifford Burrows ", "As we open stores we always plan a phased refurbishment after five and then after 10 years depending on the details of the lease.  What we are doing at this time is taking that opportunity to do a more comprehensive refresh certainly with the major refurbishments and as Howard said earlier, I think a great example is the total transformation we\u2019ve made of Spring Street in Soho.  To a similar or lesser degree, we are investing in our new pallets and taking the opportunity to really refresh our stores in a major way like we haven\u2019t done before.  ", "We\u2019re taking the opportunity while we\u2019re not opening 70 stores to try and bring forward some of those refurbishments and we will accelerate that rate as we see the returns on those investments.  Not only does it give us a chance to refresh it from a customer point of view but also to include new developments such as our Clover brewed coffee which we\u2019ve introduced in our first store in New York in Spring Street and it\u2019s a much better way for us to give a total comprehensive upgrade to the Starbucks offer.  The reaction of the customer so far has been fantastic.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from [Sarah Sinatory] \u2013 Sanford Bernstein.", "[Sarah Sinatory] \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "I just have a question on the margins which obviously huge material improvement but I guess I want to get a sense of how much of the investment going on now like you talked about is sort of behind product launches and how much of it is a run rate that we should expect?  Because, if I assume for example you allowed all of the incremental cost cuts to flow through this quarter I think that would show up as something like 30 basis points of leverage on each of your points of comp.  Is that right?  Are you sort of over investing now and then the kind of steady state leverage would look better than what we saw in this quarter?  Can you just give us a sense of as we get to a more normalized operating model what kind of margin expansion we should think about?", "Tory Alstead ", "I think the one thing I would say and you\u2019re quite familiar with all the work we have done over the past year and that has really come to bear now on this second quarter.  We saw it in the first quarter, it\u2019s more apparent in the second quarter where we have US operating margins moving to record levels.  We have now moved past the highest points in our history in terms of margin level attainment both at the total company level and the second quarter particularly in the US segment which has really been the dramatic engine of that profit growth over the past year and specifically this fiscal year.", "The margins that I would expect going forward are sustainable with all the work that we have done and I would also say that we will invest against the brand to drive growth in to the future, recognizing that we don\u2019t have our eyes set on any one quarter but we have our eyes set on the specific growth pillars that we have in the years ahead.  That\u2019s why I specifically mentioned that while the second quarter did not have as much of for example, this marketing investment that we will see in the third quarter, frappuccino is a multibillion dollar brand for us and we will spend appropriately and heavily against that very long standing and profitable brand in the second quarter.", "VIA will be one of our billion dollar brands in the future so we will appropriately invest against that and balance these investments at the same time with driving improved margins.  So as I said over the past year, while we have delivered significant cost saves, not all those cost saves will flow to the bottom line.  We take care of our partners, we fund healthcare and we invest for the future.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Analyst for Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Analyst for Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I\u2019m wondering if you can talk more about the traffic and the comp momentum?  I guess you noted that it was more broadly driven across day part and category so what piece do you think is maybe macro driven and maybe across the specialty coffee category?", "Howard Schultz ", "I\u2019m going to anticipate a comment from someone about McDonalds so let me hit that first in terms of macro trends and the noise in the marketplace.  First off, in terms of the economy and the issues we\u2019re all facing I think there\u2019s some evidence that consumer spending on the margin is better than its been but I don\u2019t think any of us who are operating a consumer brand or a retail business is assuming that the economy is going to get much better.  So I think the credit that we deserve is that the operational people of Starbucks, the marketing and all the efforts on a comprehensive basis are driving traffic in to the store because of the service levels and the fact that we are exceeding expectations around all things coffee and the brand.", "With regard to McDonalds, we certainly saw their numbers today and the things they\u2019re saying about coffee.  If they\u2019re getting incrementality on coffee, they\u2019re not getting it from us and the numbers speak for themselves.  As we said last year when they spent a fair amount of advertising dollars, we benefitted from that because of the level of awareness that was created in the marketplace and the significant differentiation between our experience in the cup, in the store between they and us.", "On a go forward basis we feel very comfortable that we can operate and navigate through the headwinds of the economy at this point and we\u2019re certainly feeling no effects from what McDonalds is doing or saying, it\u2019s a non-factor.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Ivankow \u2013 JP Morgan.", "John Ivankow \u2013 JP Morgan", "I just wanted to get back to the US margins, as we\u2019ve kind of talked about you\u2019re very close to or at peak margins now and I do understand some of the specific investments that you have coming up for the US but you\u2019re obviously not spending money just to spend it, you\u2019re spending it for a return in the future and that\u2019s a fairly obvious comment.  To further editorialize, US total employment year-over-year hasn\u2019t even bottomed and yet your traffic is up over 3% so I guess I\u2019m asking the question is, is there anything that really prevents the US margins from continuing to march up?  ", "Do you internally have a number like 18, or 19 or 20 that you don\u2019t want to get us beyond that you\u2019ll just reinvest to take market share?  Then, if we could just continue on with that and talk about potential benefits from things like a new point of sale system, continued supply chain work and even ERP that might help your margins in the future.  So just the overall question is about what we could expect for US margins assuming continued recovery in the US economy?", "Tory Alstead ", "There\u2019s a lot there so let me try to tackle it.  In terms of the US, yes we\u2019ve recovered that business back to peak margins and as I\u2019ve said very clearly over the last year we expect that the US has not seen its peak.  So where two, three, four years ago the US hit its peak margins, I\u2019ve been very clear that I expect that business with the benefit of the work that\u2019s been done led by Cliff and his team over the past year to be able to exceed that.  I\u2019ve typically said that I expect that business to settle in somewhere in that mid to upper teens range and I still believe that\u2019s the appropriate place for that business.  ", "I\u2019m not going to put out a specific percentage target today but suffice it to say that we\u2019re very confident we have a healthy US business that can sustainably deliver that kind of margin performance.  Now, to try and push it beyond that would be not appropriate in terms of investing back in to the health of our store base, our people and the growth opportunities that we see and so we\u2019ll always strive to find that right balance between investing in our future and delivering results now.", "You\u2019re right, the investments that we make now we fully expect to pay off or we wouldn\u2019t be spending them but they tend to pay off over the longer term and that\u2019s the basis for them.  So that speaks to that issue.  What I would tell you in terms of point of sale, I\u2019m going to turn that over to Cliff here in just a moment to speak a little bit more in detail about supply chain has been over the past year and continues to be an area that is delivering efficiencies to us.  That\u2019s something that I would expect we\u2019ll continue to see in the coming years as we continue to improve procurement, distribution and manufacturing efficiencies.", "Clifford Burrows ", "We are in the midst of our deployment of our new POS system and our ERP systems and as you can imagine that\u2019s quite a major work stream with our US company operated install base.  All of these new systems combined with the work of lean, the store designs and new products as we bring them on stream are all designed to help us build capacity in stores and build efficiency to give us time to concentrate on building our relationships with our customers and delivering the Starbucks experience with obviously the longer term goal of delivering great satisfaction for our customers and with the help of our rewards program to encourage people to come more frequently.", "These are a lot of investments and a lot of time going on to making the process improvements which will help support the longer term profitability and margin enhancement in the US business.  So again, as Troy said, no specifics but lots of work programs against it and we\u2019re encouraged by the early deployment that we\u2019ve done so far.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "My questions sort of following on to that supply chain efficiency and how it might relate to food, on our checks I guess we\u2019ve noticed we\u2019re kind of spoiled in New York and its considered I guess internally what is sometimes a fresh market where we have the full array of food and I\u2019ve noticed in travels that you\u2019re starting to see more and more of the turbo chef ovens showing up in the Midwest markets and they\u2019re getting now the lunch as its rolled out.  Can you give us an update where you stand as far as those markets that do have the full array of food and what\u2019s the time table before you have the entire company owned store base, and I\u2019m strictly talking company owned not the Target stores and the license stores, when you could have the potential to have the full array of products and we could maybe see food cross in to the 20% or better as a percentage of overall sales?", "Clifford Burrows ", "Just to say we have now this national recipe here in the US or program of recipes, some of those markets are fresh, some of those markets because of logistics are frozen.  We have focused in recent years on deployment of our warming oven and really by the end of this year we will have covered the vast majority of our portfolio.  I\u2019m talking 90% of stores will have been reached and that most probably because of lease details or indeed supplier issues to remote markets will be just about the program rolled out.", "In terms of the growth of food, we are focused on better quality food, on improving the assortment and also serving better day parts.  It\u2019s not about seeing food increase to the levels you described as a percentage of sales, we are focused on helping customers justify another visit or another occasion.  We do see food playing a more strategic part in different day parts as well as supporting the overall growth of our business.", "Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Then how does that 90% compare to where you stand now?", "Clifford Burrows ", "We\u2019re getting pretty close.  This is my I suppose catch up year to reach that portfolio so we\u2019re getting pretty close to that number.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jeffery Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Jeffery Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Actually just two follow up questions, one as it relates to VIA.  I\u2019m wondering if you can give some updated color in terms of it seems like it is continuing to go very well but the contribution to the comp versus margins and mix shift?  I\u2019m wondering how you even go about measuring cannibalization of that product or the competitive threats that are coming in to the market around that product.  Then other one was just China, which I know you guys have periodically said is the largest market outside of the US, I just wonder if you could talk about perhaps the pace of development?  I know you said comps were strong but relative to international how are they faring?  And, what\u2019s the food and beverage mix on the China business?", "Howard Schultz ", "Let me try and take VIA first.  Troy mentioned in his remarks that we believe we\u2019re sitting on at least two new billion dollar new growth vehicles for the company, one is Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee and the other is VIA.  To frame the VIA opportunity and the size of the prize it\u2019s a $23 billion global instant coffee and at home market with only $1 billion or so coming from North America.  So the big opportunity is outside the US.", "Having said that, we\u2019re not really competing with existing instant coffee, we are reinventing a existing category and changing behavior.  We went in to VIA in our US retail business assuming that we would have some level of cannibalization.  The truth is we have seen no cannibalization to VIA and in fact, all ships have risen around things for coffee at home.  That\u2019s been a big win for us. ", "What we\u2019re seeing is that VIA is changing behavior because of the mobility of the product, being able to take it on the go and the fact that we went from two SKUs and added decafe which is almost 20% of the specialty coffee market overall and as I said in my remarks we are just getting started with VIA.  VIA is not a product or a promotion, it is a significant new platform for the company which will have multiple varietals, multiple blends, multiple form factors and ubiquitous levels of distribution domestically and internationally.", "It will be a competitive environment but we\u2019ve got the brand and most importantly we\u2019ve cracked the code in terms of quality and being able to replicate the taste of coffee and we have our store base to be able to tell the story and sample the product.  What we\u2019ve decided internally though is we are no longer going to break VIA out in terms of its contribution to comps because of competitive issues. We just don\u2019t want that information out.  But, we can tell you it is driving incrementality, it\u2019s not cannibalistic and it\u2019s creating new behaviors and we think the best is yet to come because we\u2019re just getting started with three SKUs and we only have it in existing retail stores.  Within this quarter you\u2019ll see it in 30,000 points of distribution supported by a major marketing campaign.  With regard to China, I\u2019ll just give it to John.", "John Culver ", " First off, as we said, China represents a tremendous opportunity for us and we had strong momentum in the second quarter.  We have a very profitable business there and we are poised to grow.  We\u2019re going to do it in a way that brings the Starbucks experience to life to the Chinese consumer and the good news is that our customers in China are responding very favorably to not only our beverage offerings but then also to our food offerings and our newly designed stores. ", "What we will continue to do is look at how we create locally relevant products whether it be in food or whether it be in beverage that will speak to the Chinese customers and resonate with them and ultimately drive traffic in the stores.  But, we see huge opportunity there, we\u2019re going to continue to grow the store base.  Then in addition to that we\u2019re going to look at other channels to grow in whether it be the packaged goods business, whether it be food service, or whether it be with SBC.  So we see huge opportunities in China and we are going to go all out for that opportunity.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Nicole Miller Regan \u2013 Piper Jaffray.", "Nicole Miller Regan \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "On the topic of VIA I\u2019m extremely interested about what other form factors could mean just generally?  Then, it was very helpful to understand Japan is a $5 billion market, what would be the next biggest market that you would target and how fast could you get distribution there?", "Howard Schultz ", "I don\u2019t mean to in anyway try and evade the question but we\u2019re not going to get in to what markets we might go in to next.  There is a big, big prize outside of North America where solidable instant coffee is more than half of consumption in most of the markets outside of America, with quality of coffee that hasn\u2019t really doesn\u2019t taste like coffee so we\u2019ve got a big opportunity. ", "I can\u2019t get in to other form factors other than to tell you that we\u2019ve been studying VIA for quite some time and we believe that we\u2019ve got a big, big opportunity.  If you look at what we have done in Japan in just a quick period of time, we used our retail stores in Japan to tell the story, to replicate the taste challenge.  We have enormous press and interest and as a result of that be in a position to take advantage of the fact that that market is 80% instant with over 50 years of coffee that doesn\u2019t taste like coffee.  We\u2019ve got the brand, we\u2019ve got the story, we\u2019ve got the national footprint in order to be able to execute a strategy that no one else could do.", "We can do that in many, many markets around the world.  So you will see an array of product, an array of form factors as we believe we can take a significant share of a $23 billion category that has seen no innovation that is still growing.  It\u2019s just a very, very big opportunity for us.", "Operator", "", "Your last question comes from Mitchell Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research.  ", "Mitchell Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research", "In general it seems like the focus or the increasing focus is on the CPG segment and of course VIA and they do tie in to the at home market.  One thing that I think you\u2019ve talked about over the years and have is brewing equipment for the at home market and I\u2019m just wondering on a go forward basis is that an opportunity for you as it seems that at home is becoming an increasing focus and yet brewing equipment has not been a big part of the Starbucks story?", "Howard Schultz ", "We\u2019re certainly well aware as the leading specialty coffee brand as to what\u2019s going on around single serve and specifically at home and have had a watchful eye on what Green Mountain and Keurig have been able to do and they\u2019ve done a fantastic job.  We\u2019re looking at this two ways, one we think that VIA has an interesting opportunity to position itself in a way against what Keurig is doing at home because there is no waste, there is no cost of equipment and you can take VIA anywhere and the quality of the coffee is significantly better and we\u2019re going to have multiple SKUs and form factors that will create a portfolio of products.", "However, I think the market needs to stay tuned that we have every intention of understanding what single serve can be and we\u2019re not going to just sit back and watch Green Mountain and Keurig march their way in to 20% to 30% household penetration without Starbucks doing anything.  So, just stay tuned.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "", "Thank you very much.  That concludes Starbucks\u2019 call for the quarter.  We\u2019ll talk to you in July.

I am delighted to report the record fourth quarter and fiscal 2010 results we announced today. Before taking you through the highlights of the quarter and the year, I want to pause to thank our Starbucks partners around the world that have enabled us to deliver these great results to our shareholders. We did it by delivering a great experience to our customers, one cup at a time, every day of the week. The success we describe today belongs to you. I'm grateful for and humbled by your dedication, your passion and your determination, all of which have powered our transformation into the dynamic and growing company we are today. And to each of you, I say thank you.", "I believe that fiscal 2010 will prove to be a defining year in Starbucks' history, topped off by record fourth quarter and full year financial and operating results. And the results we reported today are that much more significant when considering against the backdrop of the extraordinarily challenging economic and consumer environments in which they were accomplished. The hard work our Starbucks partners undertook around our transformational agenda over the last two years has enabled us to where we are today. More importantly, I am convinced that the work has provided us with solid and secure foundation we need to profitably grow both new and existing lines of business well into the future.", "Today, I will share highlights of our Q4 and full year 2010 financial and operating results, discuss a number of important accomplishments that may not be evident from the figures alone and introduce some themes that we will discuss in greater detail at our December  investor conference. And I'll turn things over to Troy who will take you through financials in greater detail.", "As we reported today, our comparable store sales in Q4 were outstanding in both U.S. and international markets, resulting in an 8% increase overall that was driven by a 5% increase in traffic and a 2% increase in average ticket. Strong top line results, combined with a continued focus on operational excellence and cost management initiatives, drove our consolidated operating margin to 14.1% of sales, significantly ahead of the 8.2% we reported in Q4 of the prior year. Our EPS followed suit, increasing to a record $0.37 a share in the quarter and up from $0.20 a share in Q4 of 2009.", "The positive trends we saw in Q4 capped the year of continuous, quantifiable improvement and progress in our business. Q4 represented our fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp growth and our fourth consecutive quarter of positive traffic growth. For the year, our revenues increased to $10.7 billion, and our operating income increased by $857 million to $1.4 billion, from $562 million in fiscal 2009. Our full year operating margin of 13.3% represented the highest consolidated operating margin in our almost 40-year history, surpassing the previous high of 12.3% we achieved in fiscal 2005.", "Our record's results are a function of solid performance both in the U.S. and in our International business. Let me share a little about each of our business units performed in fiscal 2010 starting with our U.S. retail business.", "Starbucks' ability to innovate and create excitement around new beverages and beverage combinations continues to drive traffic and generate incremental sales, and we are just beginning to benefit from the strategy of leveraging our brand, our retail footprint and our power to innovate to expand our range of coffee offerings and create new rituals, categories, occasions and formats both in our stores and other complementary channels of distribution. Sales of Starbucks VIA continue to accelerate, with our retail stores continuing to drive trial and acceptance and create positive momentum in all channels. VIA represents a broad and innovative coffee platform that generated about $135 million in global sales for Starbucks in retail and CPG channels in its first year, making it a runaway product success by any objective measure.", "Sales of Iced VIA, introduced only this summer, have been more than 80% incremental to the original product line and the early results from Flavored VIA introduced in our North American retail stores in September are even more encouraging. VIA is playing a key role in the rapid expansion of the premium single cup category, which includes pods and sticks with a retail price point of $0.50 per serving or more. And with our ongoing commitment to innovation, we will continue to build the VIA platform and bring more new customers into our world of premium coffees.", "With the retail introduction of VIA in our innovation pipeline is only part of the story. We will discuss the unique cross channel distribution and marketing model that we have developed for VIA in much greater depth and detail at the December investor conference.", "We are also equally excited about Starbucks Reserve, our new brand of super premium, whole bean, specialty small batch coffees introduced in Q4 to about 700 of our stores, online at starbucks.com and to an exclusive loyalty promotion on gilt.com. Customer response to the debut of Gal\u00e1pagos coffee, a superb, exotic coffee, was nothing short of overwhelming. Gal\u00e1pagos sold completely out in our stores at a full price point of $25 a pound. In the gilt.com site, the coffee was sold out in less than 12 hours.", "Starbucks' coffee authority and the breadth of our reach today is demonstrated by our growing range of product offerings from VIA instant to complete lines of packaged and flavored coffees and now to Starbucks Reserve. In the future, you will continue to see us drive trial and acceptance of new products and formats in our stores, and then migrate these new products and formats into CPG channels in a way that no other coffee company can hope to do.", "We are very excited about the upcoming holiday season, including the introduction of a new VIA offering and that will be VIA Christmas Blend. We will be offering our popular traditional holiday beverages, Creme Brul\u00e9e Latte, Peppermint Mocha and Gingerbread and Eggnog Lattes, and we will reprise our successful 12 Days of Sharing promotion and offer many exciting new products for the gift-giving season.", "Our continued laser focus on improving our customer experience is resonating with our customers, and I am pleased to report that despite increased store traffic, every single performance metric, from accuracy, speed of service, beverage taste and overall satisfaction improved in fiscal 2010 from the already industry-high levels.", "In addition, lean initiatives are playing an instrumental role in our ability to achieve success by improving our capacity at peak times and providing our progress with improved beverage preparation routines, which in turn has lead to order accuracy and beverage quality and taste. As our business and our financial and operating performance have strengthened, so too has the overall health and vitality of the Starbucks brand. We continue to enjoy top-of-class status as a consumer brand on social and digital networks such as Facebook, where we continue as the number one brand with over 22 million connections globally. Twitter, where we have 1.1 million followers and Foursquare, where we have more than 2.5 million check-ins.", "Media campaigns around Starbucks VIA, customizable Frappuccino, our recognition as the number one best coffee according to the Zagat Survey, and most recently, Starbucks Reserve, provide us with a consistent advertising voice throughout the year. We will continue to utilize traditional and nontraditional marketing approaches to drive traffic, trial and acceptance as we continue to make our marketing efforts and programs even more proactive, cost-efficient and effective in the future.", "I am particularly excited about the future opportunities presented by the new Starbucks Digital Network. I'm convinced that the Starbucks Digital Network, in conjunction with Spring Wi-Fi in our stores, will become an increasingly more compelling brand and in-store differentiator over time, one that will enhance the Starbucks' customer experience and reinforce Starbucks' position as a unique and critically important local community gathering place.", "In 2010, we refreshed or remodeled about 1,000 stores in our U.S. portfolio. In 2011, we plan to do about the same, while maintaining cost discipline and introducing new store designs that are locally relevant, emphasize coffee and create a sense of innovation and excitement for our customers. Our newest stores in Seattle, Olive Way, is our most recent introduction. This Seattle flagship store will also better inform our understanding of the afternoon and evening day part opportunities for a segment of our store base around the world.", "Growth in our Starbucks Card business continues to accelerate at record rates. During fiscal 2010, we loaded more than $1.5 billion on the Starbucks Cards, a 20% increase over 2009 and the Starbucks Card is now used to pay for nearly one in five consumer transactions. And My Starbucks Rewards continues its fantastic momentum as our loyalty platform. Nearly 2 million customers have joined the program since its launch 10 months ago, and more than 1.25 million have reached the top gold level tier making by making at least 30 purchases.", "Let me turn to International. As we've said on previous calls, one of our top priorities for 2010 was to apply the learning and operational rigor gleaned from the hard work we did in the U.S. over the last two years to our international markets. The results we reported today, including positive traffic and ticket trends, double-digit operating margins and vastly improved profitability, demonstrate the unequivocal success of those efforts. While we know there is much more to do to streamline operational structure and increase operating efficiencies throughout our international organization to provide a solid foundation, we know we need to more fully exploit opportunities in Asia and to grow our business and improve our performance across Western Europe over both the short and long terms. I will briefly touch on noteworthy developments in some of the key markets.", "Canada, currently our largest market outside the U.S., contributed solid transaction, ticket performance and profitability compared to both Q4 and full year 2009. Japan comps turned positive early in the year and have remained strong, with VIA continuing to drive trial and traffic adding to incremental sales and powerful results in the market. We continue to make solid progress in the U.K., with traffic reflecting strong growth year-over-year. Particularly encouraging was U.K. customer response to My Starbucks Rewards program, where the cards' percentage of tender, a key measure of customer loyalty, doubled in 2010 compared to a year ago.", "Our business in France, a market we took full control of at the beginning of fiscal 2010, is improving on plan as well. Traffic is up, and receptivity to the Starbucks brand overall continues to grow as younger French customers increasingly discover us in both mall and neighborhood stores. Germany delivered 10% comparable store sales growth in Q4 as improved beverage quality, speed of service and store upgrades combined to attract more consumers to our stores. Noteworthy as well is that in 2010, Starbucks was honored with the distinction of being the best coffee house in Germany by the Deutschland Institute of Service Quality.", "Moving to China, we are seeing fantastic comparable sales growth and increased profitability in China as local relevant offerings such as Green Tea Frappuccino, Coffee Jelly Frappuccino, Mocha Valencia, Iced Tea, juice beverages and moon cakes, as well as the Chinese consumer using our stores as their third place, continue to resonate well and attract new and repeat customers in our over 700 stores in Greater China. We continue to open new stores in China with great response. In September, we opened Changsha and Fuzhou to enormous crowds and exciting brand buzz. Average daily sales for these new stores are far exceeding even our most optimistic projections.", "Two markets that present great strategic opportunity for us are Brazil and India. We recently took full ownership of our business in Brazil and are now developing plans to expand that market. Similarly, we view India as a new significant market opportunity that is now ready for Starbucks, and we are now developing plans and engaged in discussions with potential partners on how best to enter that market.", "Turning to CPG. As you know, we won Starbucks VIA through Starbucks retail stores in the U.S. and Canada one year ago and started our nationwide expansion into multiple North American CPG channels just six months ago. In the short time, we achieved over 40,000 points of distribution. More recently, we began accelerating our global distribution of VIA and are now reaching close to 55,000 points of distribution, including multiple CPG channels in Japan, Canada and the U.K. And we will be entering additional international CPG channels where instant coffee is the norm in the months and quarters ahead.", "We are extremely encouraged by a recent consumer research indicating that 22% of VIA's volume and 18% of VIA users are actually incremental to the coffee category, providing VIA with one of the highest incremental volume scores that Nielsen has reported on new items in years. And VIA consumers report that 70% of their usage occasions are incremental to existing coffee occasions. Spurred by these findings, we are moving our efforts to drive trial and awareness of VIA into high gear in order to fully leverage the value and opportunity of the brand and the portfolio of products. As I mentioned earlier, we will go into greater detail about all things VIA at the December investor conference.", "Consumption of Starbucks packaged coffee within CPG channels have shown consistent growth over recent months and has outpaced growth in the premium coffee category overall. We continue to build awareness, volume and distribution behind innovation and product line extensions.", "Now as you know, green coffee prices have increased almost 50% over the last nine months. In our view, this increase is the result of extreme speculation and not a result of normal market forces. We do not believe this is sustainable. And while many coffee roasters quickly sought the cover of the recent price vitality to substantially raise prices, we have largely resisted doing so. As customers are assured, however, that Starbucks will continue to use our reach and close relationships with coffee farmers and  co-ops around the world to continue to ethically source, roast and make available the highest quality coffees in the world despite the recent price movements.", "Seattle's Best Coffee. SBC continues to gain momentum, and we are particularly excited about the new relationships that SBC established in 2010 with leading national QSRs including SUBWAY and Burger King and with AMC Theaters. SBC played a prominent role in Burger King's September breakfast launch, and Burger King will be committing major advertising dollars to support behind its coffee program with its Free Coffee Fridays promotion, in which free cup of Seattle's Best Coffee will be available to consumers every Friday morning in November at participating Burger King locations. Over the next several months, you will see the new Seattle Best brand, its architecture fully come to life across all retail CPG and Foodservice channels.", "Before concluding my remarks and turning the call over to Troy, I would like to share a recent development with you. For the last 10 years or so, Starbucks packaged coffee has been distributed to grocery stores and other outlets by Kraft Foods. A month ago, we informed Kraft of our intention to discontinue the distribution arrangement. The details and timing around any transition will be subject to further private dialogue. We intend to work closely with Kraft to ensure an orderly transition, putting an emphasis on ensuring that our mutual customers are well served. We intend to keep our discussions with Kraft private, and we are not in a position to provide further commentary at this time.", "In conclusion, today's results reflect the great strides we have made over the last two years. But the lessons and the insights from the hard work done in connection with our transformational agenda have not been forgotten. I'm proud to report that Starbucks today is firing on all cylinders throughout the company and around the world. It is indeed a very exciting time for all of us.", "But I'm most proud of our relationship with our partners. Our decisions to preserve key elements of the partner experience from healthcare to our 401(k) plan to equity in the form of stock options have enabled us to preserve and enhance our culture and values as the guiding principles of our company. I have long believed that success is best when shared with others, that's why it gives me great personal pleasure to announce that our results in 2010 enabled us to share a special bonus with nearly 100,000 of our store and roasting plant partners. In this way, as I said at the outset, today's success truly does belong to our partners.", "I'll now turn it over to Troy.", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. Building on Howard's comments, the fourth quarter was an outstanding one for us, continuing the momentum from prior periods and capping a truly landmark year for the company. We recorded the highest earnings per share and consolidated operating margin in Starbucks' history for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. Strong comparable store sales growth, including the acceleration of the two-year trend in the fourth quarter and increased leverage as a result of our work to become a more efficient operator, contributed to the record results. Considering the still-challenging macro environment and the investments we are making today that will benefit future periods, these results are particularly rewarding and substantiate our efforts to increase the value of our business model through both customer-facing and back-of-house initiatives.", "Today, I'll provide additional details on our fiscal fourth quarter results as well as a recap of our full year fiscal 2010 performance. Then I will provide an update to our outlook for fiscal 2011 based on recent trends throughout the business.", "Fourth quarter revenues were $2.8 billion, up 17% from $2.4 billion a year ago. The revenue increase was due to an extra fiscal week in 2010 and an 8% increase in comparable store sales attributable to a 5% increase in traffic and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. Excluding the 53rd week, revenue growth for the quarter was 9%, primarily driven by the increase in comparable store sales. Both one-year and two-year comp growth was strong again this quarter. In particular, two-year comp growth continue to accelerate, and two-year traffic growth reached the highest level in three years and is indicative of the continued improvement in the health of our global business.", "We reported consolidated operating income of $399 million in the fourth quarter, including $6 million of restructuring charges related to previously announced store closures in our International segment. Excluding those charges, non-GAAP operating income was $406 million. This compares to fourth quarter fiscal 2009 operating income of $199 million and non-GAAP operating income of $253 million. This quarter brings to a close to the restructuring charges related to previously announced store-closure programs in the U.S. and International segments.", "Consolidated operating margin was 14.1% on a GAAP basis and 14.3% on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting a 390 basis point improvement compared to last year's non-GAAP operating margin. Similar to recent quarters, comparable store sales growth combined with operational improvements are creating significant flow-through to operating income. Earnings per share was $0.37 for the fourth quarter, compared to $0.20 per share in last year's fiscal fourth quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was also $0.37, compared to non-GAAP EPS of $0.24 a year ago. The 53rd week contributed approximately $0.05 to EPS this quarter. Excluding the extra week, non-GAAP EPS grew 33% in the fourth quarter.", "Before moving to the non-GAAP results of our operating segments, I would like to point out a slight change in our reporting structure this quarter as we uphold the results of our Seattle's Best Coffee and digital ventures businesses into other, along with our unallocated corporate expenses. While Seattle's Best Coffee had portions of its results previously embedded in all three of operating segments, the largest impact is to our Consumer Products Group, since Foodservice and Packaged Coffee make up the largest share of the SBC business. We made this change to align with our internal management reporting structure and because of our belief in the long-term growth prospects of SBC.", "With that, I will now move onto the results from our U.S. segment. Total U.S. net revenues for the quarter were $2 billion, a 15% increase from a year ago. Company-operated U.S. retail revenues increased 15% to $1.8 billion for the quarter due to the extra week and an 8% increase in comp sales. The comp increase was driven by a 6% increase in traffic and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction.", "Excluding the extra week, U.S. segment revenue growth was 7%. The 6% increase in transactions was the third straight quarter with positive year-over-year traffic and matches last year's strong performance. Traffic growth measured over a two-year period continued to accelerate and reached its highest point in over three years. Customers are responding well to the enhancements we've made to the in-store experience, and satisfaction scores continue at near-record levels.", "Additionally, as Howard mentioned earlier, our loyalty program continues to gain traction with customers. And similar to last quarter, we estimate that it contributed roughly a point to the overall comp growth this quarter. The relaunch of our Frappuccino platform last quarter through a customizable offering continue to perform well, also contributing roughly a point to the overall comp growth.", "With respect to the increase in average value per transaction, the pricing architecture work that we started in the fiscal fourth quarter of last year was the largest contributor, followed by VIA sales, which were enhanced by the introduction of Iced VIA and the continued expansion of our food-warming program. U.S. cost of sales including occupancy was 38.0% of total revenues in the fourth quarter, an improvement of 200 basis points compared to the year-ago period. Most of the improvement was the result of sales leverage and supply-chain efficiencies, partially offset by higher dairy costs. U.S. operating expenses were 38.2% of total revenues, a 220 basis point improvement over last year. Sales leverage was the primary reason for the improvement as we continue to drive efficiency at the store level.", "While efficiency is a key focus, the quality of the customer experience is paramount, and we understand the importance of striking the right balance for the long-term health of the business. We continue to make progress on the refinement of our work routines within the store, including a recent change related to beverage production intended to create a better and more consistent experience for our customers in terms of beverage quality and speed of service.", "Additionally, we're providing new tools to our store partners that will enable them to focus more on providing world-class customer service. Our new point-of-sale system is now deployed to roughly half of our U.S. stores, and we anticipate that we will have it in all U.S. company-operated stores by the end of this current quarter. This tool is much more intuitive to the user and provide several benefits, including faster training of new baristas, better speed of service and more accurate orders.", "Another tool, our new inventory management system, is now deployed to all company-operated U.S. stores. This system allows our store partners to have improved visibility into their store's particular inventory needs, increasing their ability to have the right products on hand while managing waste more effectively. U.S. operating income was $343 million for the quarter, a 66% increase compared to last year. The operating margin improved 530 basis points to 17.4% of related revenues from 12.1% a year ago. The primary driver behind the margin improvement was sales leverage and strong comps along with a more efficient operating model contributed to create powerful flow-through.", "U.S. segment continues to be the engine behind our outstanding performance as a company. We are reaching new highs in profitability, and we see new opportunities for disciplined growth ahead in this segment. Our stores provide the foundational experience to our customers, and we continue to bring that experience to more consumers around the world, which brings me to one of our future growth engines, International.", "International total net revenues increased 21% to $619 million in the fourth quarter, driven by the extra week, comparable store sales growth of 7% and the acquisition of France market at the beginning of the fiscal year. The comp growth was driven by a 4% increase in traffic and a 3% increase in the average value per transaction. Excluding the extra week, revenue growth for International was 12%.", "In line with recent trends, we again saw broad-based strength across all markets, with the U.K., Canada, and China contributing the most to comp growth. Transaction growth remains strong across all key markets as we continue to improve the customer experience using many of the strategies that were successful in the U.S. Also, we have recently started to realize some increase in the average value per transaction in the U.K. and Canada as we refined our pricing architecture in those markets similar to what we began in the U.S. just over a year ago.", "China comps continue to be exceptional, accelerating this quarter from the already strong double-digit trends in recent quarters as we've been successful with local product offerings in addition to the core beverage lineup. The strong comp growth is contributing to significant operating income and margin improvement in the region. We will share more insight into this region and others at our upcoming investor conference.", "International operating income was $91 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, more than double last year's $45 million. In fact, operating income for the last two quarters alone surpassed the previous full year record for operating income in this segment, tangible proof that we've reached a critical turning point in this business. Operating margin improved by 600 basis points to 14.7% building from last quarter's 10.9% and reaching an all-time quarterly record. Key drivers of the margin improvement compared to last year includes sales leverage and supply-chain efficiency.", "Acknowledging the benefit from the extra week this quarter, the recent performance trends at the International segment are still impressive. We are now starting to hit our stride internationally, and we're more confident than ever in the potential that resides outside the U.S. Key growth markets such as China are performing exceptionally well, and we're starting to reach the scale at which we can begin to leverage the infrastructure we've been building over several years.", "There are still opportunities to go deeper with disciplined store growth in our largest, most mature markets where we expect to accelerate store growth in those that are still emerging or under penetrated. This growth will enable us to improve on existing operating margins while bringing the Starbucks' store experience to more customers around the globe and ultimately increasing our share of coffee consumption in our markets. As the foundation to Starbucks, our store experience allows us to build trust with our customers and opens the door to growth opportunities in other channels that tend to offer higher returns with less capital, which now brings me to the results of our global Consumer Products Group.", "CPG total net revenues increased 19% to $201 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Slightly less than half of the increase was due to the extra week in the quarter. The remainder of the increase was spread across the portfolio, including VIA and Packaged Coffee sales. Operating income for the segment decreased 10% to $79 million for the quarter, and operating margin decreased to 39.4% from 52.0% last year. The margin decrease was primarily due to the launch expenses for VIA and the lower income from our ready-to-drink partnership. The decline in income from the ready-to-drink business is primarily related to increased dairy costs, combined with a price rollback in the grocery aisle, slightly offset by an increase in volume.", "We continue to drive distribution, placement, awareness and trial for VIA in this channel that is critical for future growth, and we're extremely encouraged by the results to date. Over time, we expect CPG, both domestic and international, to eventually hold the lion's share of sales for this product, similar to Packaged Coffee sales.", "I mentioned the segment reporting change earlier that moved Seattle's Best Coffee and digital ventures in with our unallocated corporate expenses. Almost all of the revenue in this grouping is related to the Seattle's Best Coffee business. Revenue for this group increased 46% this quarter to $44 million, the majority of which was driven by SBC Foodservice sales. We will share more on our strategy for SBC and how it fits into our enterprise portfolio at the upcoming investor conference in December. Corporate, general and administrative expenses increased 25% compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to the extra week in the quarter and performance-based compensation.", "I will now recap our full year fiscal 2010 performance and a few key metrics. Earnings per share was $1.24, compared to $0.52 last year. Excluding restructuring and transformation-related costs, non-GAAP EPS was $1.28, compared to $0.80 per share in fiscal 2009. We recognized $53 million in restructuring charges in fiscal 2010, the majority of which is related to the previously announced store closures. Consolidated revenues for fiscal 2010 increased 10% to $10.7 billion. The increase was mostly due to a 7% increase in comparable store sales, comprised of a 4% increase in transactions and a 3% in the average value per transaction. The addition of a 53rd week and the foreign currency translation primarily related to the Canadian dollar also contributed to the increase.", "With respect to comparable store sales, the U.S. segment had the largest impact where comps increased by 7% with a 3% increase in traffic and 4% increase in the average value per transaction. Internationally, comps were also strong for the year, with 6% growth overall comprised of a 5% increase in transactions and a 1% increase in the average value per transaction. As we have discussed today and in prior quarters, momentum built throughout the year as we work to improve the customer experience to add new innovations such as VIA and our customizable Frappuccino platform and to build frequency to our revamped Starbucks Rewards loyalty program.", "I'd like to share a few details on the performance of VIA this year. We launched VIA in five countries during fiscal 2010, first into our retail stores followed by other channels such as grocery and Foodservice. We estimate overall systems sales to be roughly $180 million for the year, of which nearly 80% is attributed to the United States channel. To put this in perspective, according to external estimates, less than 1% of all new U.S. product launches in the consumer product space reached the $100 million threshold in the first year after introduction. We will share much more information on VIA at our upcoming analyst conference, including some statistics that show how VIA is being used in ways that are incremental to other coffee occasions and substantiate our belief that VIA is a platform that is poised for significant future growth.", "The conclusion of fiscal 2010 represents a milestone for the company in many regards. We exited the year in a much stronger financial position than we entered it. We returned to top line growth during the year. We achieved record levels of profitability due to the combination of that top line growth and the operational leverage of our improved business model. Financial results from this year provide a confirmation in our belief that we have successfully transformed the U.S. business from where it was only two years ago. With the U.S. business healthy, our focus is now on capitalizing on the significant opportunities that exist through international store expansion and outside the store in our CPG segment.", "Starbucks continues to generate significant free cash flow as a result of the health of our business model, enabling us to both fund profitable growth opportunities and to return significant amounts of cash back to shareholders. We generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow and over $1.2 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2010. We initiated our first ever dividend this year, and we repurchased over 11 million shares during the year. In total, we returned approximately $460 million to shareholders in fiscal 2010 through dividends and share repurchases. With a less capital-intensive stage of growth on the horizon, we're in a strong position to enhance shareholder returns in the future using these levers as appropriate.", "I will now give you an update to the fiscal 2011 outlook that was provided on last quarter's call. Given Howard's comments related to our partnership with Kraft and the evolving nature of those developments, this outlook does not reflect any potential changes to revenue nor expenses related to those developments. We will share more details as and when appropriate.", "We expect mid to high single-digit revenue growth for the year on a 52 week basis, driven by low to mid single-digit comp growth. We closed fiscal 2010 with strong top line momentum, and we expect that strength to continue as our business is healthy and an improved store experience is resonating with customers. Despite the strength and momentum in our business, we remain somewhat cautious as we recognize that the economy is still pressuring consumers with indicators such as unemployment, housing and consumer confidence slow to recover from the recession.", "Our outlook for store growth is unchanged. We plan to add approximately 500 net new stores globally, with roughly 100 in the U.S. and roughly 400 in international. The majority of the new additions in both segments are expected to be licensed stores.  We now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million to $600 million for fiscal 2011. This is a slight increase from the outlook provided on last quarter's call, driven in part by more capital for renovations.", "Full year non-GAAP operating margin improvement is now expected to be 100 to 200 basis points in both the U.S. and International segments. We still expect CPG operating margins to be in the range of 30% to 35%, slightly lower than fiscal 2010, primarily driven by increased investment to support the ongoing VIA rollout. Consolidated operating margin is expected to improve by 50 to 100 basis points over 2010. We now expect fiscal 2011 earnings per share to be $1.41 to $1.47, or 15% to 20% growth on fiscal 2010 non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding the benefit in 2010 from the 53rd week.", "Similar to last quarter, I will now provide an update to a few items of interest that are embedded in our targets. First, we continue to expect VIA will contribute modestly to fiscal 2011 earnings. Similar to fiscal 2010, we expect this year will be a year of investment in the VIA platform as we build this business and capitalize on the incredible opportunity to take great coffee to people in more parts of their lives around the globe. Next, we now expect to absorb roughly $0.08 to $0.10 in additional commodity costs for fiscal 2011, mostly related to higher coffee prices, although other commodities that we use such as cocoa and sugar are also on the rise.", "As many of you are aware, C-market prices for Arabica coffees are at levels not seen for more than a decade. While we, along with external experts, continue to believe that the fundamentals of the coffee market indicate a pending oversupply situation, which would put downward pressure on prices in a normal market, speculative investors have continued to drive up prices in the short term. As a result, we now believe we will be forced to lock in portions of our fiscal 2011 supply at higher prices than previously forecasted. This expected impact from higher commodities is reflected in the EPS outlook I just provided.", "Lastly, there is no change to my commentary from last quarter regarding marketing expenditures. We still expect to spend roughly 2.5% of revenue on marketing, including our share of spending accounted for indirectly through shared profit models such as our ready-to-drink business.", "In closing, I, along with the leadership team, firmly believe that the best days for Starbucks are ahead, and that we are in the early stages of a new era of growth for the company. With our significant retail footprint, the direct engagement list and trust we have from our customers and our ever expanding CPG presence, we possess a unique business model that no other retail, consumer product or restaurant company can match.", "We are a leader with unequaled brand equity in the global coffee market, a market that is still highly fragmented and hold enormous opportunities to not only capture additional share of the existing market, but to grow the number of occasions where we could bring great coffee to people in more parts of their lives. As mentioned previously, we will host our biannual investor conference on December 1, at which time we will provide more details on our strategy and the opportunities that are in front of us.", "With that, now let me turn the call back to the operator to begin the Q&A. Amanda?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] You're first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Just a broad question on comp trends. Obviously, they've been extremely strong to date. I'm just wondering if you can kind of size up, one, I guess the value of an incremental comp to annual EPS looking to fiscal '11, whether you think you have the ability to sustain the current comp momentum on, I guess, a one- and two-year basis with the two-year becoming a lot more difficult now. Perhaps any color on the actual comp needed to protect the existing margin and whether you can give any color specific to October relative to the quarter just reported.", "Howard Schultz", "Troy, you want to start?", "Troy Alstead", "Yes, I'll start. I'll take part of that, and I think Howard and Cliff may speak to parts of it as well. First, as we've said historically, a comp point to us over the course of the year is roughly worth $0.04 to $0.05 a share. So that's math we've discussed with you previously and that continues to hold true. Now in terms of what comp is necessary to protect our margins, I guess I'll just refer you back to our targets where we have said that we expect low to mid single-digit comp growth in this coming year. And with that kind of comp growth, we can expand total company margins 50 to 100 basis points. Clearly, we can survive and thrive in our business given what we've done -- all the great work we've done around the business model this past year on something lower than that at least in this coming year. So we feel very confident in the comp trends we came through the current year with and very good about our margin targets in the coming year given what we've seen. I would say, before handing it off to Howard to also respond to your question, that we won't make any comments at all about October.", "Howard Schultz", "I think, considering your question, I think it's hard to answer that without putting consumer confidence and unemployment in the mix. And so we want to be very thoughtful and disciplined about how we're looking at the year. I think the pipeline of innovation and the excitement we have about holiday and the year, but coupled with the environment, we're comfortable with mid single-digit comps as a way in which you can look at the year. I think the extraordinary numbers that we put up over the last couple of quarters of high single-digit comps is not a good starting point. Mid single digits is where you should go.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Joseph Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Two questions, one on CPG. Can you talk about the contribution of the VIA contribution to CPG revenues in the quarter or the year? And if you were to annualize the fourth quarter, what would those numbers look like? And then a question on U.S. pricing. Just what kind of price increase you might be running right now year-over-year?", "Troy Alstead", "This is Troy. I'll speak to, first, to CPG. And the answer is we won't speak to specifically the impact of any one operating segment. I would just remind you that during the year and progressively throughout the year, that we launched VIA into the CPG channels and built distributions that went through the year. So it would be premature at this point in time to talk about the impact of VIA in any one channel, other than to say we've been extremely encouraged by what we've seen. We, as you know, have invested heavily against VIA this year, as I mentioned in my prepared comments. And in fact, the impact you see in the CPG operating margin this year reflect that investment and reflect the recognition that we expect VIA to be a growing and significant business for us over time and it's worth investing in now. What I have said throughout the year, and I'll reaffirm now, is that for the total company, VIA was essentially a net neutral impact to our P&L during the year. Again, and that's made up of good contribution from the product, offset almost entirely this past year by the launch costs and the spend against it to build it in our stores and then in the CPG channels.", "Howard Schultz", "Cliff, you want to hit the pricing question?", "Clifford Burrows", "Joe, it's Cliff here. We are continuing to follow the approach to pricing architecture that we started 14, 15 months ago. And in that, we are looking at, obviously, all the commodity pressures on us, notwithstanding the comment Troy made about the impact of extraordinary coffee pricing. And we will continue to follow that approach, reviewing region by region. We did take some increases in one region at the beginning of October, and that has had a positive impact to offset commodity prices. And we will continue that work in the coming months. We don't see any reason to break away from that. And it's given us a new discipline, and it already is looking at the local market and is looking at the consumer behavior in that market and the complexity of beverage. So we're very pleased with the progress we made and the customer reaction to any increases we've taken, frankly, over the last 15 months.", "Joseph Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Could you say what pricing assumption is in your same-store sales guidance for fiscal 2011?", "Troy Alstead", "No, we haven't specifically said what that is. It varies by market. Some prices go up, some go down as we have said before and as we've executed over this past year. To further Cliff's comments, we remain committed to an overall pricing architecture work, meaning, I wouldn't characterize it as a straight out increased by any means. We hold prices where we can to provide value to consumers. In the past year, we've taken prices down where necessary and where appropriate. Consumers are responding well to it, and we would fully expect to execute that kind of much more architected intelligent approach to prices in the coming year.", "Clifford Burrows", "And Joe, it's also just worth adding that the way we have employed our Starbucks Rewards Card ensuring that we add value to our most loyal and frequent customers. So it's been a much more holistic approach using pricing architecture, our Rewards Card and ensuring best value for our customers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore - Bernstein Research", "I just wanted to ask about some your international markets and the idea of owning versus having a partnership. I think China is sort of mixed, but you have recently started to bring in other countries. So can you just talk about is that the kind of thing that you would do with a rapid growth market like China? Because it is, I think, something that you've targeted as being your biggest market outside the U.S. And I know we've talked about this before in terms of the depth or the size of the market and the possible profitability of determining what you bring in-house versus partner. But could you talk about that specifically with China?", "Howard Schultz", "This is Howard. Let me start. I think between myself, Troy and John Culver, we'll try and take a piece of that question. I think with over 50 countries that we are now doing business, there obviously is a cross-section of many different ownership models that we have and there isn't one size that fits all. It has to do with the complexity of the market, the capability of the local partner and our ability to recognize that there's a big upside if we could take advantage of buying back a market as we did with France and most recently with Brazil. I think Brazil is a good, maybe, case study where we've been in that market for a number of years. Our partner there, for a whole host of reasons, did not have the capital capability to really accelerate the business. And we look at it as just a tremendous runway of growth. And so we acquired that market because we feel we both have the capability and, obviously, the capital to take advantage of a market that is significantly under-stored. I think as you look at China, there is an opportunity in China, I think, which we've said for years that will be the biggest market for Starbucks outside of the U.S. And over time, I think it's in our interest to have more ownership than less. If you recall, we bought the Beijing business back a number of years ago. And so there isn't one size that fits all, and there's no formula for success here. I think we're very conscious of making sure that we balance these decisions by providing maximum shareholder value, and at the same time, taking advantage of making sure that we maintain our leadership position. With that, I'll just have John Culver kind of jump in, since he's closest to all of this, and provide some color.", "John Culver", "Yes, Sara, this is John. I think there are really three things that we look at. First is the opportunity to continue to accelerate and grow that market and continue to build the overall share of Starbucks coffee consumption in that market. I think that's first and foremost what we look at. The second piece that we've been digging into is understanding the complexity of doing business in that market, where we need to enlist the help of a strategic business partner where they have local capabilities and infrastructures that can help us grow rapidly in the market. We then make that assessment and determine whether or not we need to leverage a partner and have a business partner, or whether we want to grow it ourselves. And then the third piece is around where we can see the opportunity to build out infrastructure ourselves and gain operational leverage over a period of time. And obviously, there's investments that go into these markets. And what we're seeing now is the investments that we've made in the international space in our markets are now beginning to pay off, and we're seeing scale drive into our International business. We're seeing also operational leverage coming into our P&L, and we'll continue to assess each of our international markets independently as we look at the opportunity to grow those in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I don't want you to obviously talk about anything you don't want to regarding Kraft. But I am curious whether you ending the relationship with them on bagged coffee in any way influences your potential strategy in the future for single cup brewing platforms that you're not in in a significant way at this point? And if there are any preliminary thoughts about just general timing of that and whether you think single cup could be as incremental and maybe even more incremental to your business and what VIA has been.", "Howard Schultz", "John, this is Howard. I certainly appreciate and respect the question. But I hope you realize that the situation with Kraft and the statement I made is all that we can talk about today. And at the appropriate time, we'll be as transparent as possible. But at this time, we just can't go any further. I'm sorry.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. Of course I understand. Just a second follow-up if I may on -- you ended the year with around $1.6 billion of cash. And obviously, free cash flow is going to go up in fiscal '11 versus fiscal '10. So I just wanted to get a sense of, I mean, how you're thinking about deploying that cash, whether just straight kind of share buyback dividend, or is there any opportunity for strategic acquisition, for example, that may possibly fit into Starbucks' portfolio.", "Troy Alstead", "John, what I'd say to that is that we have, over the course of this year as we came through the restructuring of our business, introduced a dividend for the first time as one way to deploy capital. We've reintroduced share repurchases as another way to deploy capital. Of course, the top message around our cash flow is to invest back in our business, in our partners, in our stores, to invest in the growth opportunities we see in front of us, VIA, our CPG business, SBC. So we will ensure we maintain adequate capacity to fund all the tremendous growth opportunities we have in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. in our store channels and outside of our stores channels.", "Howard Schultz", "John, let me answer the second part of that question. And I want to answer it in a way that no one on the phone overreacts to the response. Clearly, the history of the company has been to primarily grow organically, and that has been quite successful for the company. And we feel we've uncovered significant runways for organic growth both in our core business and the adjacencies around the innovation that we've created. But I do feel that the future of the company over time will not be isolated only to organic growth. And as I said, I don't want anyone to immediately react or respond to that. But clearly, we're in a unique position. And over time, if opportunities prevail themselves, we would take advantage.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And this question is really for Troy or John, possibly. The International margins were clearly very strong in the quarter. And Troy, you said that a lot of it came from sales leverage and supply-chain efficiency. I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the U.S. programs like the point-of-sale system or the labor management tool, the inventory management tools. Has this stuff been rolled out to international? Where is the status, and what's the plan or the timing for that eventual rollout?", "John Culver", "Keith, this is John. We're in the process of taking a lot of those tools from the U.S. and bringing those into our international markets. The POS system that Troy spoke about around the U.S. businesses is being rolled as we speak into Canada, and then we'll eventually move over into the U.K. this year. We have inventory management in Europe right now as part of our GBSF [ph] platform, and we're going to continue to look at those systems and leverage those systems and bring those systems over into our international markets throughout 2011 and into 2012. In addition to the systems, we're also taking a lot of the learnings out of the U.S. as it relates to store operations, and in particular, lean. And we've introduced a lot of the lean practices from the U.S., learnings that we've gotten into our international markets, and those are being phased in as we speak now as well. So we continue to see those systems and those processes paying off and driving more operational efficiency and helping us to increase overall speed of service into the international markets. In addition, what we're also seeing is the opportunity to expand the loyalty and the Starbucks Card program. And we're in the process of rolling that out into our international markets, introducing loyalty as a component of that, and we're seeing great success. We discussed the U.K. We're seeing tremendous success as it relates to the Starbucks Card there, and we continue to see that in our other international markets as well.", "Troy Alstead", "And Keith, it's Troy. Perhaps what I would add to that, and perhaps put the umbrella of the overarching question here, which is the significant improvement we've seen in International margins as we progress through this past fiscal 2010 and is evidenced by Q4 and by the margin improvement that we've announced in our targets for fiscal 2011, really is a reflection of the margin march toward that mid to upper teens that we expect in our International business over time. It's coming earlier than we expected. It's coming as a result of the things John has mentioned about us in a very disciplined and systematic way, bringing the great learnings from the U.S. that has helped us move that business through extreme strength and health and applying those as appropriate market-by-market internationally. And it has given us even more confidence both in the long-term growth outside of the U.S. and our ability to drive significant profitability to those channels.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Troy, I was wondering from a coffee perspective, how much do you have locked in of your projected usage for 2011 at this point? And as you look at that $0.08 to $0.10 of penalty, I'm just curious how that kind of would spread over the different divisions? I don't know if you feel like you have as much pricing power in consumer products to maybe offset some of the coffee impact?", "Troy Alstead", "Sharon, we're some handful of months forward on pricing at this point in time. As you know, and I think as we've discussed in the past at various points in our history, we are a range of price protected forward based on cup cycles and a whole number of other factors that influence when we priced and commit to some of the contracts. So we have some protection forward. In terms of how that rolls and the impact of those commodity increases hits our individual segments, we're not prepared to talk about that yet. It's a bit early the year. It is something that I expect we'll share more as we go through the year and as we understand how this very unusual coffee cup environment plays out. So no additional segment commentary at this point in time, other than to say the actions we've taken as a total company within the businesses and overall had been successful in giving us confidence that we can manage through and overcome those increased commodity costs this coming year and able to absorb $0.08 to $0.10 of additional cost pressure and yet still deliver 15% to 20% earnings growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt DiFrisco from Oppenheimer & Co.", "Matthew DiFrisco - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Looking at the Kraft agreement, I understand you don't want to talk about specific details. I'm just wondering motivation behind such a thing. I've heard you talk a lot about managing the brand through all the channels and having greater control of that in-house. I'm wondering looking now, say, the next couple of years out, with this strategic decision to make this decision to bring it in-house, is that the pure motivation behind it is to manage it? Or is it also financially motivated as far as one would assume it's been accretive for you guys? It must have been a pretty strong earner for Kraft as well, so it's also got its benefits on the earnings front.", "Troy Alstead", "Matt, I appreciate your question. I'll just repeat what Howard said a short time ago. We, at this point, will respect our partnership with Kraft and the private dialogues that will continue and ensue in the months ahead. And so no additional comments at this time.", "Matthew DiFrisco - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Looking at that remodels, can you talk about the findings, what you've found so far from those stores that have been remodeled? Is there a difference in the way the customer uses it? Are they finding it more conducive to spreading out their sales throughout the day? Are they taking in more food, are they higher average check? What are you seeing as far as that, or is it just purely velocity and just to better overall magnifying the business from the older store was doing prior?", "Clifford Burrows", "Matt, it's Cliff here. Just to say that with each refurbishment, we are really looking at it on an individual store basis, bringing, obviously, equipment up to date and bringing the environment up to date. But the individuality comes on focusing on the local customer and making sure we're catering for their needs in all the day parts and looking at how we grow the relevance of that store for those consumers and for the local environment. We're also taking the opportunity to increase our sustainability of those stores and all new stores being LEED-certified and many elements included in the store being local materials, locally sourced. Same time, we are introducing the opportunity to involve and include Starbucks Reserve to our Clover brewed system where it's relevant to the consumer. Brewed range is being enhanced in terms of presentation and offer. And you know in Olive Way here in Seattle, we have also had our first Starbucks store, which goes into the evening and is focused on that day part with a beer and wine offering. Too early to talk about the results of that. But the encouragement is that our consumers have reacted as if it was there forever and have increased their frequency and opportunity to use that store and have given us great feedback. So there's lots happening. And store-by-store, we are seeing a much stronger local engagement. Same time, we're training our people, so we are more efficient, improving the quality and focused on improving the partner and the store experience. So lots happening.", "Howard Schultz", "Troy, you want to just bring some color about the economics of both the class of stores we've opened this year and the remodels.", "Troy Alstead", "Yes, I'll speak to that. In fact, it's an area that we will definitely, at the upcoming investor conference, go deeper into the economics and what we're seeing. But as I've suggested throughout the year and I can say more strongly now that we've completed the fiscal year, our new store economics this past year have been very, very strong, have met and exceeded all of our thresholds again, providing to us very nice returns on capital. And it gives us confidence both in our ability to design and open new stores and get the kind of returns that we once enjoyed, and we expect, in our targets going forward, be able to enjoy those again. And in terms of remodels, we're very selective. And in addition to improving experience and the flow, are also very conscious about these return capital metrics and expect these stores and these investments to pay off and have been very, very encouraged by what we've seen.", "Matthew DiFrisco - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Also, just on the book keeping thing, did I miss it yet or have you launched in any of the markets the publications you were talking about coming out free on the Wi-Fi free journals, free Wall Street journals, free Zagat?", "Howard Schultz", "We launched the Digital Network in October. You should be able to go into over 7,000 Starbucks stores and enjoy it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank", "I know this was just one quarter. Profit this quarter increased a lot, and a lot of it was the U.S. went up almost $140 million, $46 million International. And CPG division had a small decrease. So obviously, you're driving this, the EPS and this big gain this quarter without much help yet from that CPG division. I'm sure there's a lot left over for your analyst day on this topic, but could you give us -- sketch out how we should think about the contribution from this division and the investment phase we're seeing recently, how long this would stretch and maybe what your guidance for fiscal '11 includes in terms of profit contribution from that division.", "Howard Schultz", "I think it's an important question because of our enthusiasm about CPG and leveraging the retail footprint and brand to benefit that channel. Let's start with Troy, and then we'll introduce Jeff Hansberry who runs our CPG business.", "Troy Alstead", "David, the slightly reduced margins that we experienced in this fourth quarter in CPG are really part of what we've been talking about all this year around our primary investments in VIA and being ready to invest behind an entirely new and innovative product platform, recognizing that it has a runway for years and years to come in our business across multiple channels. And we've had the tremendous opportunity given the significant strength of our U.S. business and the improving profitability internationally to invest back in our future growth opportunities. I mentioned SBC earlier, which we continue to invest again and excited about the prospects in the future and about CPG. In the year ahead, the targets we have for the CPG business explicitly, which are, in the release today, are that 30% to 35% operating margin in that business. We won't be more specific at this point. We'll certainly talk about that in much more depth, again, at the investor conference in December. And now I'll have Jeff speak a little bit more specifically to what he see is coming in the business.", "Jeff Hansberry", "As I look at the CPG business overall, my team and I are very encouraged at the potential going forward. Howard spoke in his comments about VIA and the traction that we're seeing on the brand. We continue to build out distribution on the brand. As we move into '11, we'll continue to invest in building high quality trial and awareness. Some of those data points that we're very excited about include the 70% incremental occasions. And what's very exciting is that we're bringing a whole new segment of users new to the coffee category, young users under the age of 30 into the category. In fact, 18% of the volume for VIA comes from new users who hadn't played in the coffee category previously. Our pipeline of innovation on VIA, including Flavors and Iced into the CPG space, will not only improve our revenue and velocity and distribution but it will also improve our retail presence and visibility and help us strengthen our position in building the premium single cup segment. Beyond VIA, we see continued growth in our Packaged Coffee business where we continue to build share. And also, on our Premium Tea business, we're growing share as well. So we're very encouraged by the progress that we're making on the U.S. CPG business.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Troy, you had mentioned being pleased with the returns of the new stores you've opened. You clearly have margin and sales momentum. So why haven't you raised your unit opening targets for the U.S.? Are you now building  a pipeline so that we'll be talking in a quarter or two about a more robust U.S. opening schedules? If you could talk about that. And just to clarify a response to an earlier question about the International margins. Why did they get so much better this quarter versus the prior two or three where you also had good sales momentum? Was there something that changed this quarter? Was the extra week an additional benefit in the International segment, for example? What happened this quarter to make it go -- drive it so much higher than prior quarters?", "Troy Alstead", "John, let me speak to the International margin question first. And I'd say yes, the extra week contributed as it did across all the business. So that's certainly a part of it. I'd point out that if excluding that extra week, the margins in the International business were into the teens and clearly, at a record level for our International business. So still very strong without the extra week, frankly. And what it reflects is continued  top line growth and improvement. John mentioned earlier a number of things that he and his team have been bringing to bear internationally, and we really are beginning to see the impact of those things pay off for us. I don't predict that every quarter we'll necessary make the step forward that we did this quarter, but we're quite confident as we progress through 2011 that we'll make another big step forward to the tune of 100 to 200 additional basis points in '11 around the margins internationally. And again, this is on a very disciplined, systematic move forward to get that business up to -- comparable to U.S. levels we believe. Now to your first question on stores, we, as I mentioned earlier, are extremely encouraged, quicker than we thought on the performance we're seeing in our stores. And that's come in two forms, the improvement, and we'll talk about this and much more depth in early December. We have, over the last couple of years, improved just the health of the portfolio of new stores, the quality of the sights, the top line of new stores, the flow-through to profitability of new stores were all higher than they've been in years. At the same time, we have managed cost down, where we're opening new stores now at higher quality levels to the consumer than ever before, and yet at a lower cost than they were two and three years ago. So we have attacked all sides of the unit economics of our stores and seen that improvement come. We fully intend to ramp up our new store growth. In the U.S., that will come. It will be disciplined, it will be paced. And it will be faster, I predict, in 2012 than it is in 2011 as we just continue to ramp up our capabilities and do this in a very thoughtful way. Over time, we've said before, internationally, ultimately, will ramp up even more quickly as we take these learnings from the U.S. and deepen our capabilities. And now with the increased confidence of a healthy and improving business model, that gives us increased confidence to open stores both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you all very much. As JoAnn said at the top of the call, we look forward to seeing you at the investor conference on December 1, and we'll provide a lot more depth and texture to many topics and themes that we talked about today.

My name is Steve, and I will be your conference Operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations at Starbucks Coffee Company. Joining me on the call today are Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; John Culver, President of our International business; and Troy Alstead, CFO. ", "Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements and should be considered in conjunction with our cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. ", "Please refer to the Investor Relations section of Starbucks' website at starbucks.com and the financial statements accompanying the earnings release, where you'll find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Note that the non-GAAP amounts reported relate only to prior fiscal 2010 amounts for costs related to the now-completed restructuring work. ", "Before I turn the call over to Howard, let me highlight two upcoming events. First, we expect to file the company's proxy statements within the next week. And second, please note that Starbucks' 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held in Seattle at 10:00 a. m. Pacific time on Wednesday, March 23. The meeting will be available via webcast. ", "With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on the call. I am very pleased to announce the record quarterly results that Starbucks reported today. Solid increases in global traffic and the strongest holiday season in Starbucks' 40-year history drove our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comp store sales growth and enabled us to generate record revenues in Q1. Increased revenues, combined with the success of our ongoing efforts to improve our operations and efficiency and maintain tight control over operating expenses across the company enabled us to deliver both record operating income and record operating margins. ", "Our performance in Q1 reflects the power of our new business model and the continuation, and in several areas an acceleration, of the positive momentum and trends we began to see take hold in 2009. Notably in Q1, we saw a record operating performance from our U.S. retail store business, solid expansion of our Consumer Packaged Goods business, particularly around VIA, meaningful payoff on prior-period investments in our International business and a further deepening of our connection with millions of customers around the world. Each of these factors speaks to the relevancy and the health of the Starbucks brand and the strength of our global business. ", "Solid operating performance in Q1 also enabled us to offset some of the impact of both historically high coffee and other commodity costs and the new investments we're making in CPG to support our future growth. And this performance, in conjunction with the positive momentum we saw across all of our channels in Q1 and the financial discipline and rigor we continued to apply to all aspects of our global operations, positions us to perform well despite the continuing soft global economy, the fragile consumer environment and increasing commodity costs, all of which we are prepared to address in the year ahead. ", "I will begin today's call by sharing financial and performance highlights of the quarter, discuss a number of important accomplishments and developments that may not be evident from the figures alone, and then turn the call over to John Culver, President of Starbucks International, who will provide you with deeper insight into Starbucks' record performance in markets outside the U.S. Then we'll turn the call over to Troy, who will take you through the quarterly financials in greater detail. ", "Starbucks global revenues reached a record $3 billion in Q1, up 8% over the same period last year. Our comparable store sales for the quarter rose 7%, and our operating margin grew to 17%, reflecting the strength of our brand, the power of our business model, increasing operating leverage and our continued laser focus on controlling costs. Together, these factors enabled us to deliver record earnings of $0.45 per share, up from the $0.32 per share we reported last year. ", "Starbucks continues to execute throughout the company, and our Q1 results reflect very solid performance in both U.S. and international markets. I will share highlights from each of our business units, starting with our International business, where I'll simply make note of a few items and leave the more detailed presentation to John. As we have reported on prior calls, among Starbucks' top priorities over the last 18 months, as we've been transforming the business, has been applying the learnings and operational excellence gleaned from the work we did in the U.S. to our International business. ", "The International segment results we reported today demonstrate, without question, the unequivocal success of those continuing efforts and the growing relevancy of the Starbucks brand around the world. And while there is much more work to do, a streamlined management organization and increased operating efficiencies throughout our international operations provide us with the solid foundation we know we need to fully pursue opportunities in new and existing international markets in the future. ", "Just a few weeks ago, John and I were in India together to sign and announce the entry into a Memorandum of Understanding with Tata Coffee, India's leading grower and roaster of coffee. The importance of this strategic relationship with a reputable, values-based organization like Tata will become clear over time as we begin our journey in India. The Tata partnership will provide us with local sourcing and roasting capabilities and a partner with common values and a keen understanding and appreciation for the very high standards we maintain around delivering the Starbucks experience. We expect India to become an important market for us, and we will leverage the learning and experience from our more than 10 years in China to execute a profitable, disciplined growth plan in that country. ", "As with our International business, our U.S. business also performed at record levels in Q1, with sales increasing to $2.1 billion and operating margins reaching 21.9%. As I noted earlier, Starbucks experienced the most successful holiday season in our 40-year history, demonstrating the power of our model and the positive impact of our many customer-facing initiatives and cross-channel marketing programs. Driving our performance was innovative, very cost-effective marketing and promotional programs, exciting new packaging designs, in-store merchandising and the implementation of new technologies and the leveraging of all of our retail, digital, social media and partner assets to connect with customers around the world as never before. ", "By way of one example, we used targeted investments in online advertising, social media, television and in-store promotions to increase sales of Christmas Blend, which we sold in whole bean and, for the first time, in VIA. The importance of social and digital media channels and investments in technology to our overall strategy is increasing and becoming a significant competitive advantage as we create rich, emotional engagement with consumers and enhance their Starbucks experience, while at the same time benefiting from a lower cost of customer acquisition. ", "We used social media to launch the holiday season and maintain its momentum, as evidenced by the almost 250,000 consumers who signed up to receive a daily text message announcing the specials during our 12 Days of Sharing promotion. After the quarter ended, we launched a breakthrough technology of a mobile payment application, allowing customers to pay for in-store purchases in the U.S. with select Smart phones. These are just two examples of how we will leverage innovation and digital media assets to deepen our connection with customers and drive store traffic. ", "Our successful Starbucks loyalty card program contributed significantly to our performance in Q1, and I think this is really important. In the one year since My Starbucks Rewards program launched, we've added nearly 2.5 million new accounts, increasing the breadth and depth of customers engaging with us and driving loyalty and repeat business. At peak volume in Q1, we were selling, believe it or not, 42 cards per second across the country, with customers loading, on average, 39% more on the Starbucks cards in Q1 of 2011 than they did in 2010 during the same quarter, facts that I think bode extremely well for the programs and our revenues in coming quarters. Noteworthy is that much of the performance is attributed to substantial growth in card sales outside our company-owned stores, demonstrating that Starbucks' expanding and deepening connection with its customers is extending beyond our stores and into complementary retail channels. ", "In Q1, we also continued our advance of our U.S. operational excellence initiative, with additional investment in barista training, the final rollout of our new inventory management and point-of-sale systems. ", "Finally, I'm particularly pleased to report that despite the challenges created by substantial increases in holiday traffic, our customer satisfaction scores remained near record levels, reflective of the focused effort and passion of our partners who've brought the spirit of the season to life by making each Starbucks store a warm, welcoming environment for our customers. And to each and every one of our partners, I extend my deep level of appreciation, respect and thank you. ", "Turning to CPG. At the December Investor Conference, we shared with you our bold plans for our CPG segment. And I'm pleased to report that in Q1, we made solid progress against those plans in terms of product lineup, the building of our internal team and our impending transition from Kraft. CPG performance in the quarter was driven by several factors, including the continued expansion of Starbucks' 20-ounce bag and the introduction of Starbucks' Natural Fusions line, already the second-best-selling premium-flavored coffee brand based on velocity, or the levels of sales per point of distribution, only six months after launch. ", "And then of course, there's VIA.  VIA's system-wide sales grew in Q1 on the heels of strong merchandising support from key retailers across the United States. Starbucks VIA now enjoys a 39% dollar share of the premium single-cup category. VIA's volume in CPG channels in Q1 also increased by 16% versus the fourth quarter of 2010, while our authorized points of distribution in the U.S. CPG channel grew over 10% to over 32,000 points of distribution at the end of the quarter from 29,000 in November. We expect to see the impact of the added distribution in Nielsen as early as this month. ", "We continue to view VIA not as a singular product, but as a platform for which we are creating an innovative exciting portfolio of a number of products. Q1 marked the U.S. and Canada's launch of VIA flavors in vanilla, mocha, caramel and cinnamon, and our research is showing that sales of flavored VIA are largely incremental to sales of core VIA, indicating that the VIA platform is meeting additional need states and acquiring new, younger consumers. VIA's growth in the future will come from all of our expanding distribution points, both within the U.S. and in international markets, including China. The launch of new products, such as iced VIA and VIA flavors, can increase consumer adoption. ", "Let me once again remind you that this is a $24 billion category, most of which is outside of North America, and it is ripe for innovation. And we believe strongly we've got the formula and we've cracked the code. In Q1 alone, VIA's repeat rate grew by more than 20% to 37%, providing the VIA brand with one of the highest adoption rates among recent coffee category launches. In our retail stores, we continue to see consumers embracing VIA in such numbers that we, in fact, sold out of Christmas VIA, unfortunately, two weeks before Christmas Day. And beginning in February, we will kick off our next major national VIA ad campaign that will include TV, print, digital and in-store sampling designed to further increase awareness trial and repeat. ", "As noted at the investor conference in December, we continue to see very strong returns on every marketing dollar we spend against VIA; in fact, twice the industry average. We continue to make very good progress on our transition of Starbucks-branded coffee, Seattle's Best Coffee and Tazo tea businesses from Kraft. In Q1, we successfully transitioned Tazo tea business and began selling and distributing the brand ourselves on January 1, 2011. ", "Now we have much work to do, still, in 2011. It will be a transitional year with some added costs for us. But Jeff Hansberry has added experienced, professional muscle to his team, has the resources he needs in place, and we are fully prepared for the upcoming transition of the Starbucks and Seattle's Best Coffee brand on March 1 of 2011. With regards to CPG going forward, we are deeply committed to materially expanding our Consumer Products Group into a major business that will leverage and rival the capabilities of our retail organization. ", "We are also confident that the full benefit of the investment we are making in CPG will become self-evident once we begin to fully leverage this new capability and capture the full revenue and profit potential of the integration of our CPG packaged coffee and tea businesses in the quarters ahead, just as we have done with VIA. Seattle's Best Coffee raised the bar with a fresh brand identity, added points of distribution and new store concepts, including testing a new coffee bar concept format inside Wal-Mart Supercenter in Canada, and scored double-digit year-over-year sales gains in Q1. ", "The brand also announced its entry into the $1.4 billion U.S. ready-to-drink category with a new line of iced canned lattes. In Q1, SBC also introduced a vivid, innovative level system on its packaged coffee products, designed to both energize and simplify the coffee selection experience. The level system allows consumers to choose their preferred level of coffee boldness, from one to the least bold to five for the most bold, by number and color. Consumers' response to SBC's new system has been very strong, illustrating once again the excitement and innovation that Starbucks brands can bring down the grocery aisle. SBC products offering the level system are rolling out now and will soon be available in approximately 30,000 grocery and mass outlets nationwide. Calendar year 2011 marks Starbucks' 40th anniversary. And in mid-March, we will be kicking off a major promotional campaign featuring innovative new products and merchandise as a tribute to our customers and our Starbucks partners, all of whom are responsible for the evolution and the ongoing success of our company. ", "On a personal note, I am very much looking forward to the publication of my second book, Onward, which addresses the lessons we have learned as an organization in the three years since I returned as CEO. The book was written with our partners in mind, and all of my proceeds from the book sales will be shared between The Starbucks Foundation and the Starbucks partner CUP Fund, which was established to aid partners who may have fallen on hard times. ", "To promote the book, we plan to visit numerous cities and spend time with our partners in the field at this significant time in our company history. The book and many of the initiatives we have planned around the 40th anniversary provide us with a very unique and timely opportunity to engage with our partners and customers by honoring Starbucks' rich heritage and creating excitement about our future. Needless to say, we expect all of this energy and excitement to resonate loudly and create significant brand and emotional value for the company and, over time, for our shareholders. ", "Earlier this month, Starbucks unveiled the next evolution of our brand, representing only the fourth time in four decades that we have altered our logo's original design. With simplicity and foresight, the elegant new design frees Starbucks' signature siren from the circle, symbolizing how we plan to grow from our 40th year forward by connecting with customers through multiple channels and formats, with coffee and the coffee experience always at our core.2011 is the absolute right time for such a change. And while our siren will always represent Starbucks' reputation for coffee, quality and innovation, after 40 years, she has the strength to stand on her own and show our customers, and us, the way forward. ", "Finally, a few weeks ago, Barbara Bass, a member of the Starbucks board since 1996, notified the company and me of her intention not to stand for re-election when her current term expires in March of 2011. Throughout her tenure, Barbara has been a close friend of Starbucks and an adviser to the leadership team and me, and her wisdom, judgment and extraordinary business acumen will certainly be missed. Starbucks is a better and stronger company because of Barbara's engagement and involvement with us. On behalf of the Starbucks board and our leadership team, I'd like to personally thank Barbara for her service and wish her the very best in the future. Thank you, Barbara. ", "Now I'll turn it over to John Culver, President of International Starbucks, who will take you through more of the highlights of the exceptional quarter we had in the International business during Q1.", "John Culver", "Thank you, Howard. Q1 was an historic and, in many ways, the seminal quarter for Starbucks Coffee International. Besides marking our fifth consecutive quarter of traffic growth and our third consecutive quarter of double-digit operating margins, Q1 demonstrated the increased momentum, increasing operating leverage and steady progress we are making against our plan to fundamentally transform our International business, just as the U.S. team has done over the last several years. Our progress to date includes streamlining operations and decision making, continuing the adoption of lean techniques and introducing our new POS and inventory management systems to increase operating efficiencies. ", "The investments we have made around the world and the resources and operating disciplines we have put in place throughout the International organization are designed to enable us to fully leverage our accelerating top line and to profitably and sustainably scale our global business. In Q1, International segment net revenues increased 9%, driven by a 5% increase in comparable store sales in the quarter and the opening of 267 net new stores over the prior 12 months. Higher revenues, in conjunction with our disciplined approach around our operation, were key contributors to our record-high operating profits and margins for the quarter. In the quarter, our operating margin expanded to 16.3% while our operating profit increased 144% to $104 million. Yet while Starbucks Coffee International may never have been healthier nor delivered better results, we are not remotely yet finished with our work. International performed well across all our markets, particularly well in Asia Pacific and Western Europe. But nowhere in the world was our progress more evident than in China, where we had another stellar quarter of double-digit comp increases. ", "In China, we currently have a presence in 33 cities on the mainland. And with virtually every store opening, we are witnessing long lines of customers, positive media coverage and sales performance way in excess of our expectations. In the past several months, we opened four new cities, including what is now our largest store on the mainland and a four-story Starbucks in Xiamen. We remain extremely optimistic about our opportunity in China and are continuing to fund the local investments needed to realize the full potential of the China market over the long term. ", "Howard mentioned our trip to India two weeks ago, a trip that culminated in our entry into a Memorandum of Understanding with Tata Coffee Limited. I want to reiterate the fantastic emerging opportunity that we see India representing for Starbucks. Converting the enormous potential that India presents into long-term success will require a thorough understanding and appreciation of local customs and tastes, a strong local foundation and the ability to locally source and roast coffee, meeting the high standards that our Starbucks customers expect and deserve. Our MoU with Tata Coffee positions us to explore and understand all aspects of the India opportunity, and we're looking forward to rolling up our sleeves and working closely with our colleagues at Tata Coffee. ", "Looking ahead, Starbucks International will continue to strengthen and expand its business through a disciplined and focused approach in three principal areas. First, we will continue to grow transactions and frequency through meaningful innovation and an increased emotional connection with our international customers around the Starbucks Experience. Noteworthy are our April launch of VIA in our retail stores in China following its runaway success in Canada, the U.K., Japan and the Philippines; our late spring introduction of customizable Frappuccino and the future expansion of the Starbucks Card and our loyalty program into our international markets. ", "Second, as I told you in December, we plan to accelerate profitable new-store growth. Currently, only one in 100 cups of coffee served around the world today is Starbucks, and we remain convinced that we have a tremendous runway to profitably expand our store footprint in our 53 existing markets and to thoughtfully enter new markets. As we grow, we will remain disciplined in new site selection and focus on being locally relevant while we continue to elevate our brand and drive the long-term profitability of the International business. ", "And third, we will continue to drive more operational consistency across our entire international store portfolio. This will allow us to profitably deliver an enhanced experience to our international customers around the world. ", "In closing, I spent a great deal of time visiting our Starbucks stores around the world, and it's always confirming to see firsthand the degree to which our customers are embracing us regardless of culture. At the heart of our success are our partners, and it is our partners' hard work and passion that brings our brand to life in every country in which we operate. Our performance is a direct reflection of their efforts, and I want to thank them for making Starbucks a welcome presence in the communities around the world. Let me now turn it over to Troy for a deeper dive into the financials.", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal first quarter performance was exceptional by almost any measure across the business. We set records on many key metrics at the consolidated level, including earnings per share, revenue, operating income and operating margin. All three reporting segments, the U.S., international and CPG, contributed to both top-line and operating income growth compared to last year. And our holiday lineup delivered the strongest performance on record, both in the U.S. and in key international markets. These results underscore the strength of our core retail business and come on the heels of a record-setting fiscal 2010, a year that redefined Starbucks in many ways and established a strong foundation from which to pursue multiple avenues of future profitable growth. ", "Today, I will take you through some of the details of our fiscal first quarter performance, and then I'll provide a brief update on our expectations for the balance of fiscal 2011. First quarter revenues were $3 billion, up 8% from $2.7 billion a year ago. The revenue increase was primarily driven by a 7% increase in comparable store sales, attributable to a 5% increase in traffic and a 2% increase in average ticket. We reported consolidated operating income of $502 million in the first quarter, a 42% increase compared to first quarter of fiscal 2010 operating income of $353 million and a 35% increase compared to last year's non-GAAP operating income. ", "Consolidated operating margin was 17.0%, which represented a 400-basis-point improvement from the 13% GAAP operating margin reported a year ago and a 340-basis-point improvement from last year's 13.6% non-GAAP operating margin. Sales leverage in our global retail business and lower impairments this year primarily drove the improvement, partially offset by increased commodity costs. ", "Earnings per share was $0.45 for the first quarter compared to $0.32 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.33 per share on a non-GAAP basis in last year's fiscal first quarter. This is exceptional year-over-year growth, especially considering that we're comping over a very strong holiday period last year. Reflected in these numbers is the fact that we continue to become better global operators, providing customers a consistently satisfying experience while at the same time driving efficiency and investing for future growth. ", "I will now move to the results of our operating segments, which will be compared to the non-GAAP results last year. Total U.S. net revenues for the quarter were $2.1 billion, a 7% increase from a year ago. Company-operated U.S. retail revenues increased 7% to $1.9 billion for the quarter due to an 8% increase in comp sales, slightly offset by reduction in the number of stores compared to last year. The comp increase was driven by a 6% increase in traffic and a 2% increase in average ticket. The 6% increase in transactions marks the fourth consecutive quarter with positive year-over-year traffic and continues the strong momentum created in the back half of 2010, where we also experienced 6% transaction growth. Q1 also marked the highest two-year total end transaction comp we've seen in almost four years. ", "In line with recent quarters, the strength was broad-based across geography and product category. Our holiday platform once again resonated with customers, strongly contributing to the total comp growth. Recent pricing initiatives taken to help offset climbing commodity costs contributed less than half of the ticket increase, while the expansion of our warming program also contributed to ticket growth. My Starbucks Rewards, our loyalty program that was relaunched late in December last year, also continued to gain traction with customers, with almost $700 million loaded on cards in the quarter, an all-time record. ", "Despite the clear success of My Starbucks Rewards, we believe there's still substantial opportunity to grow the program, as customer awareness is still relatively low. We expect to drive more awareness and usage through enhanced communication of the program and its benefits in the future. I would also like to point out the strength of our licensor business in the U.S., as revenue grew by 14% versus last year. Comp trends have been very similar to those in our company-operated business, driven by many of the same factors. This continues to be a very healthy and profitable portion of the business for us. U.S. cost of sales including occupancy was 37.4% of total revenues in the first quarter, an improvement of 150 basis points compared to the year-ago period. ", "Similar to last quarter, most of the improvement was the result of sales leverage and supply-chain efficiencies, partially offset by higher coffee and dairy costs. U.S. store operating expenses were 34.8% of total revenues, a 220-basis-point improvement over last year. Lower impairment charges in the current year and increased sales leverage contributed to the improvement. The combination of top-line growth and lean principles has driven store labor productivity to the highest level in seven years. ", "As planned and communicated previously, we have completed the rollout of new point-of-sale and inventory management systems in our U.S. stores. While the full positive impact of these solutions is not yet fully evident as we work up the learning curve, we expect that these investments will enable our store teams to work more efficiently and provide our customers with an even higher level of service. U.S. operating income was $453 million for the quarter, a 32% increase compared to last year. The operating margin improved 410 basis points to 21.9% of related revenues from 17.8% a year ago. ", "This is the highest level of U.S. operating margin in the company's history, significantly surpassing the previous record set almost a decade ago. Increased sales leverage, lower impairment charges compared to last year and some pricing efficiencies all contributed to the improvement, slightly offset by higher commodity costs. The U.S. business is clearly healthy, with broad-based strength and relative stability throughout. ", "While this is certainly satisfying given where the business was just two years ago, we aspire to do more, and it's our belief that we have not yet tapped the full potential of this business. At last month's investor conference, Cliff articulated our key strategies and focus areas to go after that potential. ", "Moving forward, we will pursue those opportunities with the same disciplined focus that helped us transform the U.S. business. Moving now to the results of our International segment. International total net revenues increased 9% to $640 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 5% in our company-operated markets and strong revenue growth from our licensed markets. The comp growth was driven by a 2% increase in traffic and a 2% increase in average ticket. ", "Exceptionally strong performance in China contributed a significant portion of the overall comp growth, while severe weather in the U.K. and Canada pressured transaction trends in those key markets in December. International operating income was $105 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, nearly double last year's $53 million and the third straight quarter in which we've set an all-time record for profitability in this segment. Operating margin improved by 720 basis points to 16.3%, another all-time high and a reflection of the potential for this business as we progress on scaling the business and executing more efficiently. Increased sales leverage and lower impairment charges compared to last year contributed to the margin improvement. ", "As mentioned earlier, China performed exceptionally well this quarter, with comps in the mid-20s and profit contribution higher than that. The momentum in China is exciting, and that market is in the very early stages of delivering on the vision we've long had there. We will continue to pursue rapid growth in the form of new stores on the way to our stated goal of 1,500 stores on the mainland by 2015 as well as other channels, such as CPG and Foodservice. Equally exciting is the balanced contribution we're starting to see across the portfolio of international markets, including very strong performance in the balance of the Asia-Pacific region and improving profitability in Western Europe. ", "Collectively, the International business has never been healthier, yet we intend to do much more long term, building on our current success in core markets and tapping into sizable, still-emerging markets such as India and Brazil. I will now move on to the results from the Global Consumer Products Group.  CPG total net revenues increased 12% compared to last year to $195 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. This increase was partly related to higher sales in our packaged coffee business, with strong performance from new products, such as the Starbucks 20-ounce packaged coffee and at Natural Fusions. ", "VIA also contributed to the revenue growth as we continue to expand distribution and add SKUs, including flavors. Several key metrics continue to point to the enormous potential for VIA in the CPG channel. As Howard mentioned, volume increased by more than 16% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Repeat rates also continue to increase, with the current rate in the high 30% range, which is among the best adoption rates in the market. ", "In addition to growth in both packaged coffee and VIA, our Foodservice business also contributed significantly to the segment's revenue growth, driven primarily by an improved hospitality industry. Operating income for the segment increased 6% compared to last year to $68 million for the quarter, and operating margin decreased 200 basis points compared to last year to 34.6%. The margin decrease was primarily due to higher coffee costs and marketing expenses for VIA, partially offset by supply-chain efficiencies. ", "Regarding our transition of the packaged coffee and Tazo key businesses from Kraft, as Howard shared, we continue to make good progress, and we now have the resources in place to effectively support that business. Given the strong performance in the first quarter and now more visibility to key variables, such as coffee inputs and the transition of our packaged coffee business in-house, we're updating our outlook in a few key targets for the balance of fiscal 2011. In particular, this updated outlook, for the first time, reflects our plans to have the packaged coffee business fully transitioned in-house on March 1, 2011. ", "We continue to expect mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth for the year on a 52-week basis, driven by low- to mid-single-digit comp growth. Our outlook for store growth is unchanged. We plan to add approximately 500 net new stores globally, with roughly 100 in the U.S. and roughly 400 in international markets. The majority of the new additions in both segments are expected to be licensed stores. ", "We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million to $600 million for fiscal 2011, with roughly half of that going toward renovations and the remainder spread between new stores and other investments, such as technology upgrades. We now expect to absorb approximately $0.20 in additional commodity costs for fiscal 2011 compared to last year, mostly related to higher coffee prices, although other commodities that we use, such as cocoa and sugar, have also increased. Of this amount, roughly $0.03 impacted the first quarter, leaving approximately $0.17 for the balance of the year. ", "Coffee prices have continued to increase and currently sit near a historically high level.  While we still believe these prices are not sustainable long term, given the underlying fundamentals, in order to mitigate the risk to the balance of this year, we have locked in essentially all of our coffee costs for fiscal 2011. ", "With respect to operating margins, we now expect full-year improvement of 150 to 200 basis points compared to 2010 non-GAAP results in both the U.S. and International segments. In CPG, we now expect operating margins to be in the range of 25% to 30%, as increased coffee costs and transition costs related to the packaged coffee move in-house are pressuring margins in this segment. However, we continue to expect consolidated operating margin to improve by 50 to 100 basis points over 2010. ", "We expect our tax rate for the year to be in the range of 32% to 33%. The lower tax rate compared to fiscal 2010 is due to the expected increase in income from international markets that have lower tax rates than the U.S. We now expect fiscal 2011 earnings per share to be $1.44 to $1.47, still within 15% to 20% growth on fiscal 2010 non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding the benefit in 2010 from the 53rd week. ", "Earnings per share for each of the second and third quarters is expected to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.33. We expect Q4 to be approximately $0.35 to $0.36 per share. Embedded in this outlook is a roughly $0.02 negative impact related to the packaged coffee transition in-house. This $0.02 reflects investments in resources and systems to support the transition and is net of the additional income we will pick up once the business is fully transitioned. Most of that negative $0.02 impact materializes in the second quarter. As the business becomes fully integrated and we move into 2012, we expect it to become a progressively more meaningful contributor to revenue and earnings. Also embedded in the EPS outlook is the $0.17 over the balance of the year related to increased commodity costs that I noted earlier. ", "In closing, the first quarter's record results largely speak for themselves and continue the progression we started several quarters ago. Over the past two years, we've made structural changes, introduced new disciplines and deepened capabilities throughout the business, which allowed us to not only recover from the deep recession but to move the company to record levels of revenue and profitability. Those changes include new pricing capabilities, which have allowed us to selectively adjust prices to manage margin and average ticket while increasing value to customers; increased cost focus and discipline, which enables significant cost reduction throughout the company and more efficient supply-chain and store operations; and renewed and more focused innovation, which resulted in successful new products such as VIA. Over the balance of fiscal 2011, those same structural changes, new disciplines and deepened capabilities allow us to maintain our previous guidance of 15% to 20% earnings growth despite coffee costs that are, on average, 40% to 50% higher than last year and despite additional infrastructure investments to bring the packaged coffee business in-house. ", "As we move into 2012 and beyond, we expect these same new disciplines and capabilities will position the company for long-term healthy growth and profitability. I will just add here how personally proud I am of the company and our partners for facing this unprecedented $0.20 per share of commodity headwinds and still delivering an expected 15% to 20% earnings growth. ", "Given the fact that coffee prices have spiked to these levels in the past, but never for very long, and have always returned to normalized levels, these headwinds we face over the balance of 2011 may well become tailwinds in the future. ", "We are now on the path to creating a company unlike any other, building on the unique relationship we have with our customers to develop a ubiquitous presence in multiple channels and product categories across the globe. Our business is healthy, we have momentum and we generate a significant amount of cash flow, from which we can invest to pursue these opportunities while still delivering cash back to shareholders. These are exciting times for our company, not only in the results we see today as a result of past work, but also in the energy that is being created to pursue this next stage of diversified growth. ", "With that, now let me turn the call back over to the Operator to begin Q&A. Steve?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Troy, can you talk about the revenue impact, specifically, that you're going to gain from -- as you put Kraft into your P&L? And also the 25% to 30% margin in the CPG, can you talk about -- is that fully, sort of the fully loaded cost of that? Is that where it stays going forward? Or do you expect that to accrete over time as once you get some of these the efficiencies in place in Kraft, then you can begin to expand that margin again?", "Troy Alstead", "John, on the first question, the transition of the packaged coffee business won't have a large revenue impact this year, because it really is that transitional year where we'll pick up the business probably through the year. As we move into 2012, we fully expect to have the full revenue of that business brought onto our P&L, as well as the full earnings, and then be able to drive that business going forward. Now I will point out that we pick up revenue out of that relationship today, so the benefit that we'll pick up going forward will be a net of an increased customer revenue that we'll see hit our P&L, net of some of the revenues that's already there. Once we get a little bit further into this transition and have the business in-house and have the full business ready to go for 2012, we'll talk a little bit more about what those ongoing targets look like, but not a dramatic change to anything in 2011. Now on the margin side, the long-term margin expectation we have for our CPG business subsequent to this transition is 30% to 35%, which is what we talked about at the investor conference in December. This year, we expect that margin to be in that 25% to 30% range, as I mentioned, driven and impacted much more by this transitional impact of this year. So some one-time and unusual impacts in fiscal '11. On an ongoing basis, we would expect that, that margin to be north of 30% again.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Troy, just kind of curious, I mean coffee, obviously, has continued to go up, but it hasn't doubled again in the past three months. So can you help reconcile the kind of 15% rise we've seen in coffee with the increase that you're expecting in commodity costs? Is that because you had expected it to come back down, and now you've locked it all in? And then just juxtapose that with your pricing power, what you're thinking there.", "Troy Alstead", "With respect to coffee costs, Sharon, at the time we had laid out our previous expectations of that $0.08 to $0.10 impact, as you will remember, we didn't have very much of the 2011 coffee needs locked at that point in time. So it was very much based on what we did have committed, and then projections based on our own experts and experts in the industry of what was going to happen over the balance of this year. As the coffee prices began to escalate as we moved through December, we took the decision to remove that risk from this year, we think the responsible decision, and lock our pricing and commit to that throughout 2011. The result of that is that the movement in the \"C\" price between, say November or December and now, is not reflective of that increase and what we expect our underlying coffee costs to be over that span of time. So hopefully, that helps reconcile that difference for you. In terms of pricing, what I would say there, and we've spoken about this a tremendous amount lately, one of the big capabilities, important capabilities that we invested in and developed and continue to perfect as we came through the last 18 months or so, was our work around pricing architecture. That's been extremely valuable to us, and we continue to utilize that on an ongoing basis. We believe that there is opportunity to continue to provide significant value to customers through the loyalty card, through very competitive and value-oriented pricing on the things that matter most to them. And then, selectively, periodically, in various markets, adjust other prices as appropriate. So that is what we intend to do. And I would just point out that we don't expect to use pricing as a full measure of offsetting these commodity costs by any means. It's one tool we have. We also have a number of initiatives in the business around costs, around efficiency, that we are, wherever we can, accelerating, to ensure that we execute those in 2011 and help us offset what is a very unusual spike in coffee prices currently.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank", "What sort of growth rate are you projecting for your consolidated CPG division as things settle out going into fiscal 2012 and beyond in your 10%-plus revenue growth target? I ask because that 10% revenue growth looks aggressive, at least as I model it, unless I make some more aggressive assumptions in that division's growth. And then separately, the bagged coffee in Grocery, what's your pricing philosophy when it comes to inflation in that? And who's making the decisions on that in the interim? You or Kraft?", "Troy Alstead", "David, let me speak to part of that, and then we might introduce Jeff Hansberry to address some of the pricing questions that you referred to last. Actually, Jeff, he's here now, why don't you address pricing, if you would, in David's question?", "Jeff Hansberry", "With regard to coffee pricing, relative to where we are today, Kraft is still in control of the contract. Therefore, pricing is at their discretion. When the contract ends on March 1 and we bring the business back, pricing will be at the discretion of Starbucks.", "Troy Alstead", "And then, David, on your second question around revenue growth, what I would say to that is we believe our existing portfolio of businesses and the things we are doing to drive growth internationally, to continue to drive unit growth and same-store sales growth in the U.S. and our core lineup of products, can drive us to that 10%-plus revenue growth. We're committed to that. We're putting the plans in place to achieve that over time. We don't have specific targets for you yet around an expanded CPG Business, but suffice to say that we believe that as we transition that business in-house, as we drive more effectiveness, do a better job down the aisle, and as we add to that platform over time in ways that we think nobody can do except for us, given our ability to move customers back and forth between our stores and the CPG channel, all those things will be additive over time to that 10% revenue growth expectation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I want to ask about the $0.20 commodities forecast. Two parts to the question. The first, are you simply embedding spot rates for key commodities like dairy, cocoa and sugar? Or do you have some sort of forward assumption built into that? And what might that be? And then, secondly, have you hedged or locked in any of your dairy, cocoa or sugar? Or is it all going to float, and this $0.20 number could move at some point again?", "Troy Alstead", "What I'd say -- let me answer the last part first, Michael, and that is we expect that the $0.20 is a very solid number. While we do have pressures in other commodities, coffee is the vast majority of that, and we've locked that pricing this year. So no, I don't expect the $0.20 to move, and if it does, it would be just tiny movements and probably would still round to roughly that $0.20 impact. Now to the first part of your question, we don't have spot rates embedded. What we have is forward rates and our expectation of what we see happening in those markets combined with some hedging in places. So for example, with respect to dairy, we have about 30% of our expected use of dairy over the balance of this year hedged. So the combination of hedged and committed prices with what we see in the forward markets leads to that assumption. Similarly, with some of the other commodities that are less impactful to us but are still out there, sugar and some other things, we've got some hedging in place modestly to help mitigate some of those cost increases. And then we've got our expectations for the future that round out the rest of it. But again, what I would say is our efforts in December of 2010 to lock coffee prices is to remove that risk this year, and it's positioned us to make it a known quantity that we now are prepared to address as we go through the balance of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt DiFrisco from Oppenheimer.", "Matthew DiFrisco - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Just clarity with your response to Sharon's question. Did you say, then, that you locked in -- it appears as though you've locked in slightly below, then, the current spot price in your response. And then also, your commentary seems like you're pretty certain about that deadline of March, yet we haven't seen, really, any sort of release or any detail. Aside from asking for the numbers of the transaction and everything, are we to assume then there is very low probability that, that date will not be met then? And do you feel near 100% certain that the business model going beyond March you will be in control of the Kraft business?", "Troy Alstead", "Let me, Matt, first speak to the first question. We have locked our coffee prices for fiscal 2011. And yes, we locked those prices at lower than today's spot rates. And again, that was some efforts we did as we saw the market moving up. It turns out to be in a very favorable move for us at the time, as we have our coffee needs met for the year at prices higher than last year but at a manageable level. With respect to our transition of our packaged coffee business, we have, as we said before, terminated our relationship with Kraft, effective March 1. We are building the infrastructure, putting our plans in place to transition the business as of that date. Now with that said, as you're aware, there are proceedings in place that I won't go into detail on, but I think you're well aware that there are some legal proceedings and there's an arbitration process, both of which we expect could impact a number of things. And we'll leave the details of that to the arbitrator, but I would just speak in general to the fact that we're prepared, we're ready and we're putting our plans in place to take it over on March 1.", "Jeff Hansberry", "And, Troy, if I could add to your point, we are well positioned to take the business back on March 1. We have already taken the Tazo tea business back, as Howard mentioned, on January 1 and are now selling and shipping that business to our customers in the United States. And again, we are well positioned and ready for the March 1 date and look forward to it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "From a broader-question perspective, if you look back to the start of the year, the first time you offered, perhaps some fiscal '11 guidance, it looks like you were talking about a coffee impact of less than $0.05. Now it looks like it's pushing $0.20, when, in fact, the EPS guidance has actually been increased, and yet the comp guidance has not changed. So I'm just -- I mean, I know you've raised the margin a little bit, but it would seem like coffee being up meaningfully from where you were and most of the other drivers unchanged, I was wondering whether you can kind of connect the dots in terms of what has it been incremental working in your favor to offset these things? And then, just separately, can you give us any clarity on VIA International? I know you mentioned four markets. Just wondering if you can help us size up that success, because it seems like VIA's success is really all about international, and I know it's oftentimes difficult to break into a new market. So just to get some comfort around the ultimate success of VIA internationally.", "Troy Alstead", "Let me take the first one, then I'll hand it off for the second question about VIA internationally. What has happened as we have watched what's happening in the coffee market and ultimately moved to a place where we've locked and committed our pricing at this point in time, is we've concurrently seen a couple of things happen. First of all, the results of our first quarter were outstanding. It surpassed our own expectations. We're very confident about what we expected to see coming into the holiday period. And then we're dramatically surprised on the positive side by transaction growth, by how our holiday lineup resonated with consumers and, importantly, our business unit's ability to deliver that strong top line growth into dramatic margin improvement at the bottom line, all of which you see laid out as you look at our Q1 result. The strength of that business momentum, some of that margin improvement in International and the U.S. happening more aggressively, more dramatically and, certainly, earlier than we would have predicted, that's part of the offset.  That's much of what gives us confidence as we look at the coming few quarters. And then I'd also say everywhere we can, we are looking very closely at how to manage our business more efficiently. And as you know, much of the last two years has been a series of initiatives we've had internally to improve the efficiency of our store operations, of our supply chain, of our back office. And we continue to have initiatives underway, routinely, consistently and constantly, to drive more efficiently in the back end to allow us to deliver results and to allow us at the same time to invest in the future. Where we can, we've accelerated those initiatives, we've doubled down on those kinds of things. And those go a long way toward helping us offset the coffee costs initiative, combined with just the improving business performance that we saw in the first quarter.", "Howard Schultz", "Now let me try and answer the question about VIA in a number of ways. Let's take a step back from what we've accomplished thus far and just kind of set the stage for the opportunity. The size of the global opportunity, in terms of instant soluble coffee, as I said in my comments, is north of $20 billion. And that does not include the growing segment of single-serve. And what we've been able to accomplish, I think, is something that we think we can replicate around the world. And I would also say that when you look at the overall soluble market, the majority of it, more than, probably, 95% or so, is outside of the U.S. And I would also say that the degree of difficulty in getting success in the U.S., in my view, is much greater than it's going to be in markets where the soluble market is 80%, 90% in terms of usage. But the benefits that we have is the ability to introduce VIA inside our own retail stores, use the relationship and the trust that we have with our customers and our partners and use our stores as a sampling vehicle, which most consumer products do not have. So if you take that model and you replicate it in terms of other countries, the success we've now had in Japan, Canada, the U.K. and the Philippines all sits on our ability to kind of alter and change behavior in our stores and then, over time, bring it to the grocery channel. In addition to that, I think, over time, we will use VIA in a way that is a little bit different than we've used it today. And there's no reason in our mind that VIA can't lead into a market where we don't have scale on our retail stores. As an example, I'm not saying we're doing this tomorrow, but if you look at Russia, which is 90% soluble coffee, we now know, through our own research, the opportunity we have with VIA. Now we don't have economies of scale in that market in terms of hundreds of stores. But we've got a fantastic brand position in the market and a lot of unaided awareness about Starbucks. So all it's going to take for us to go into a market like that, or, for that matter, India, another market that is 80% soluble, and with a partner like Tata who's deeply entrenched in terms of distribution. So we're looking at VIA now across multiple channels distribution, our own stores. In addition to that, we also recognize that we've got local relevancy for VIA in terms of its flavor profile and its dairy component. And specifically, in many markets, VIA will be introduced not only as a black coffee, but also with sugar and/or with dairy. So these are the early stages of building a significant global business in an untapped $24 billion category that is not only ripe for innovation but hasn't had any innovation for over 50 years. So I think the highlight is we're just getting started. And we can check every box in terms of what we've been able to accomplish. And I think the success, the metrics in terms of what we've done, it just speaks for itself.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore - Bernstein Research", "I just wanted to check on the China comps. If I look at the sort of new-store maturity curve, can you talk about how much of that comp, maybe, just came from maturation versus how much was really like incremental demand, where you actually like a demonstrable amount of new customers and that kind of thing? Just the natural maturity curve and the difference between a mature store and a new store.", "John Culver", "Sara, this is John. I think that what we're seeing in China is that the brand continues to attract new customers into the stores as well as continuing to increase the level of frequency of our existing customers. As we've gone into new markets, we've seen that the stores and the way they are performing are really outperforming the whole portfolio in total as we enter a new market. So for us, in terms of breaking it out in terms of the incremental customers versus the existing customers, I won't go into details other than to say that the comps that we're seeing in the mid-20s are sustaining.  We continue to see heavy transaction growth, and we continue to see a level of frequency of increasing numbers into our stores with the Chinese consumers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "This is a question maybe for John and Troy. I just wanted to ask about international margins.1Q is very impressive, clearly a record.500-basis-points-plus better than last year, substantially better than fourth quarter, which was the previous peak. You've got increasing benefit from cost programs coming as the year progresses. But the guidance is still only for 150 to 200 basis points of full year-over-year increase. Is this really -- like, where's the disconnect? Is this just the commodity cost piece? Is it expenses related to expansion in India? Help me get a sense of the full-year guidance in perspective of the first quarter performance.", "Troy Alstead", "Sure, Keith. Let me try to speak to that. The first thing I'd mention is the first quarter was an exceptional quarter in International. There's no question about that. That business has been, clearly, taking the lessons from the U.S. as we've worked harder to increase [ph] partnership, to bring to bear outside of the U.S. all the things that helped us transform the business here and drive increased profitability. Much of that came together, in a very powerful way, in the first quarter. And some of that improvement is similar to what we've seen in the U.S., a seasonally driven high-margin rate in the first quarter. Similarly, in the U.S., where we saw that 21.9%, I wouldn't expect 21.9% margins in the U.S. every quarter. We definitely have some seasonality, as you're aware of. And there's some element to that internationally as well. With that said, we're very much bringing to bear the further improvements internationally. We're also cognizant of, as John mentioned earlier, all the heavy lifting that we still have to do, some of which will involve more investments in the quarters ahead around people, around infrastructure, around systems and processes. And so our journey to permanently landing the International business in that mid- to upper teens will also involve some investments in the quarters ahead. But with that said, I guess the underlying message here is, there's no question, International exceeded our expectations in the quarter. It's moving up the ramp even faster than we thought, and that gives us a tremendous amount of confidence in the guidance we have this year, but much more significant than this year, in where we think that business can go in 2012 and in 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JP Morgan.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Actually, a fairly similar question on the U.S. as well, if I may. Troy, you mentioned that inventory management point-of-sale system was not in your exceptional margin performance in the first quarter. So I was hoping if you could possibly quantify the potential benefits from those systems as they mature into the second half of 2011, and now that the point-of-sale system is fully rolled out, what you're seeing from a capacity perspective in terms of that system's ability to process more customer transactions.", "Troy Alstead", "Yes, let me speak to part of that. Then I'm going to ask Cliff Burrows, our U.S. president, to address it in even more depth. You heard correct in my prepared comments, which is that those systems are fully in place now. But as we've been saying for quite some time, there is a transitional period of time, a learning curve, where we expect to really use this year, all of fiscal '11, to learn the various additional capabilities that we have at the store level. We very much expect as we move through this year, but more impactfully as we move into 2012, that those new tools will help improve the customer experience in our stores, the partner experience in our stores and will yield us efficiencies over time, all very important parts of why we chose to make those investments. With that said, how I view things like our new point-of-sale and our inventory management system are additional tools for us over time to help drive margin improvement, but importantly, to give us tools and ways to offset all the natural cost pressures that are there in any given year. Those might be commodity pressures that we face this year, they maybe occupancy pressures in different markets at different times. This is just one more tool that, while we will see some of those inflationary pressures, we believe we can sustain U.S. margins and even build them further based on tools such as this.", "Clifford Burrows", "John, it's Cliff. One of the most exciting things is we finished this rollout, and we did it at a time when our stores were very busy. We managed to cope with the increased level of transactions that we experience normally November and December, and our customer satisfaction scores, particularly in our most intense markets, continued to remain at the highest levels ever. And that really gives us encouragement going forward. And like Troy said, this is not going to be one thing that delivers. This helps us grow our capability and our efficiency and growth capacity, because we know, as I said at the analyst conference in December, creating capacity at peak is one of our priorities. And for me, this underpins the realization of that opportunity and as we learn more effectively how to work with the new inventory management system, our in-stock position, particularly around food items, and the opportunity it gives us to increase attachment to food. And those are some of the small ways that will add to us continuing to refine and improve our margin.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Phillip Juhan from BMO Capital Markets.", "Phillip Juhan - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "This is for Troy and John. Based on your public filings, it looks like last year, in 2010, you guys generated about $113 million of VIA sales in the Starbucks stores and about $22 million in the CPG channel. Of course, that was primarily in the fourth quarter. Assuming you annualize those numbers, would you see any sort of change in that ratio in the first quarter?", "Troy Alstead", "Let me speak at a high level, but I'd invite others here to jump in. I would expect -- here's what we saw in the first quarter. We saw increased VIA sales through both of those channels. As you know, VIA was rolled out in our Starbucks stores much earlier in the year and so had more time to get up that sales curve. And we are very pleased with the level and the rate of VIA growth in our Starbucks stores in the first quarter, part of which was driven by existing SKUs, part of which was driven by new SKUs, such as Flavors and such as Christmas Blend VIA. I'll also point out that our CPG business is accelerating rapidly, and we would expect that business, with respect to VIA sales, to accelerate more rapidly as we move through the balance of this year, as that business adds distribution, as we increasingly drive frequency and repeat purchases. With that, let me ask, perhaps, Jeff Hansberry to comment a little bit more on the CPG channel.", "Jeff Hansberry", "Yes. What we're seeing on VIA, if we look at Q1, we saw growth, as Troy said, on both sides of the equation, both in our retail stores and in CPG. What we expect as we go forward, as the brand grows, awareness grows and repeat grows, that we will see a migration of volume towards CPG channels, as people become aware of the brand and try it. One of the drivers of growth on the retail side in Q1 was the launch of flavors. We'll start to see the benefit of Flavors in Q2 in CPG as we launch flavors. In fact, we're picking up significant distribution behind the Flavors and Ice launches that will start to show up at retail as early as this month.", "John Culver", "And this is John, just for a quick fill-up. On the International side, through our retail stores, we had a very strong first quarter on VIA with the introduction of Christmas Blend. And Howard spoke about the success overall, but internationally, we're very pleased with the performance in the U.K. and in Japan and in Canada. We also have China, which is coming up, which we will roll out VIA in April as part of our 40th anniversary celebration. And we're very excited about the opportunity that that's going to present as well.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you, John. So that concludes today's earnings call. Thank you all for joining us.

[Operator Instructions] ", "Now let me turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?", "Howard D. Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on the call. I am delighted to report the record Q4 and full year earnings Starbucks announced today. Fiscal 2011 was a remarkable year for Starbucks almost on every level. 2011 was a year in which we demonstrated our commitment and unique capabilities around food and beverage innovation, brought the Starbucks experience to new markets and consumers around the world, broadened and deepened our channels of distribution, deepened our relevancy and connection to customers, improved our customer experience and advanced our blueprint for profitable growth. ", "It was a year in which we reported record earnings each quarter and for the full year, very strong comp growth all around the world, achieved the first $3 billion revenue quarter in Starbucks' history, powerfully asserted our coffee authority and further differentiated and distanced ourselves from competitors. It was a year in which we reaffirmed our commitment to the thousands of communities and tens of millions of consumers we serve each week around the world and we realigned our organization to best position us to go after the tremendous global opportunities that lie ahead in 2012 and beyond. ", "What makes our fiscal 2011 performance even more remarkable is that each of these significant accomplishments was achieved despite pervasive global economic uncertainty, high global unemployment, difficult consumer environment, stubbornly high commodity costs and the formidable operating headwinds that continue to challenge global retailers. ", "Yet once again, Starbucks' nearly 200,000 partners and leaders around the world joined together and met the challenge and delivered and extraordinary experience to our customers and exceptional operating performance, financial results and economic returns for our shareholders. Starbucks Coffee Company has never been stronger or better positioned for sustained profitable growth than it is today. I have never in my career been more excited or more optimistic about where Starbucks is and where we're going as a company or felt more strongly that we have the tools in the right places to get us there. ", "Today I will present highlights of Q4 and full year 2011 financial and operating results and share a few accomplishments that will not be evident from the figures alone. Then I'll turn things over to Troy who will take you through the financials in detail and provide you with an update on fiscal 2012 outlook. ", "Starbucks' total net revenues for the quarter of 2011 totaled a record $3 billion, representing a 15% increase over Q4 2010 net revenues on a comparable 13-week basis. This extraordinary year-over-year increase was driven primarily by a 9% increase in global comp store sales. For the full year, our net revenues reached a record $11.7 billion, representing an 11% increase over fiscal 2010 on a comparable 52-week basis, largely driven by an 8% increase in global comp store sales. ", "Our full year consolidated operating margin reached a record 13.8%, excluding nonroutine items surpassing the 13.3% consolidated operating margin we achieved in fiscal 2010. And our EPS followed suit, increasing to a record $0.37 in Q4 and a record $1.52 for the year, excluding nonroutine items. ", "Starbucks' record performance in 2011 was a direct result of the discipline, the operating leverage and excellence in the outstanding execution our leadership team is driving and our partners are delivering across all business segments and around the world. Now I'll touch on a few highlights and some plans for each of these segments with you. Under the leadership of Cliff Burrows, our U.S. retail segment delivered against all operating and performance metrics in fiscal 2011, despite persistently high unemployment, low consumer confidence and a very weak U.S. economy overall. ", "Accelerating double-digit comp growth in Q4, solid operating margins throughout the year and record full year results all demonstrate our deepening connection with U.S. consumers and the increasing power and growing relevancy of the Starbucks brand.  But we are just getting started. Going forward, innovation, operating excellence and our partners' passion will continue to drive our operating performance and elevate the Starbucks Experience for our customers. We have a full pipeline of exciting new products that will be introduced for holiday 2011 and throughout fiscal 2012, including Starbucks K-Cups available in our U.S. retail stores next year. And we couldn't be more excited about our pipeline for products and innovation for 2012. ", "Strong sales momentum coming into Q4 accelerated in September in response to our annual fall promotions featuring our Pumpkin Spice Latte and Salted Caramel Mocha and Tazo Chai Tea beverage platforms, and our Anniversary Blend coffee. Pumpkin Spice Latte was a notable success, growing 44% over last year. Food sales in the quarter were boosted in part by the tremendous positive response we have had to our recent Bistro Box platform launch and to our breakfast sandwich promotion. ", "Bistro Box is available in 2 portion sizes and centered around fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains were developed and introduced in response to research showing that over 2/3 of consumers want healthy food choices with wholesome ingredients, and our food development teams delivered a great tasting, nutritious line of quality products. We will continue to roll out and expand our Bistro Box platform and remain committed to making additional wholesome and innovative food and beverage choices available to our customers in the quarters and years ahead.", "We also connected more deeply, more frequently and with more of our customers than ever before in our history. Customer participation in our My Starbucks Rewards program is accelerating, reflecting increased customer awareness of the enhanced value proposition that membership provides and we now have over 3.6 million active members, nearly 2 million of whom are Gold-level members. We added 1 million new members to the program in Q4 alone. In fiscal 2011, over $1.1 billion in purchases was paid for by the use of the Starbucks Card. And today, a Starbucks Card is used in 1 in every 4 transactions. Our My Starbucks Rewards program continues to drive traffic, frequency and incrementality for our business and value for our customers, creating further separation between us and everyone else in our space. ", "The Starbucks Card mobile app continued to gain popularity as the Android app launched in June gained adoption and the updated iPhone continued to attract and gain users. At the end of September there was almost 1 million smartphones with at least one registered Starbucks Card associated with it and both the number and value of mobile transactions is on the rise. Now coffee and coffee alone will continue to be our core and coffee innovation will continue to drive our business. ", "Two weeks ago we introduced the introduction of Starbucks Blonde Roast, a light roast coffee that represents a new roast profile and another $1 billion market opportunity for Starbucks. Blonde Roast builds on our 4-year heritage of sourcing and roasting the world's finest coffees and was developed in response to unmet demand from the approximately 54 million U.S. consumers representing over 40% of U.S. coffee drinkers and over 70% of total premium coffee sales who want Starbucks quality in a lighter super premium roast coffee. ", "Now just as we revolutionized and are taking our fair share of the global instant coffee category with Starbucks VIA, Starbucks Blonde Roast enables us to provide consumers with a premium light roast coffee alternative and greater choice and positions us to go after a greater share of the brewed coffee market both in our stores and down the coffee aisle in CPG channels, where the majority of packaged coffee sales are of the light and medium roast varieties. Blonde provides us with the unique opportunity to attract new hot and cold beverage drinkers to the coffee category. Blonde roast will be available in whole bean and ground starting in January in our retail stores and through our grocery channels. Blonde will also be brewed in our stores available in K-Cup portion packs in January and as a Starbucks VIA variety. ", "Looking ahead we plan to open at least 200 net stores in the U.S. in 2012 and to remodel approximately 1,700 existing stores, that's the most stores we've ever remodeled in a year. Store remodels provide us with the unique opportunity to drive traffic, increase our in-store efficiency, provide a more comfortable environmentally sensitive third place for our customers, further differentiate Starbucks from competitors, provide jobs in and around local communities we serve and improve the Starbucks Experience for our customers overall. ", "Now speaking of remodels, I would encourage each of you to visit our newly remodeled Times Square flagship store at 47th Street and Broadway, the next time you're in New York City. The Times Square store is an acclaimed showcase of retail innovation and green construction that we will be drawing upon as we build and remodel future stores across the country and around the world.", "The Times Square store is also a roaring financial success delivering over twice the revenue on a 70% increase in traffic compared to last year. Turning to international. I'm very pleased to report that our international business continues to accelerate. We now operate over 6,200 stores in 55 international markets and our brand has never been stronger nor our ambitions bolder. We saw accelerated transaction growth through 2011 while focused and disciplined execution enable us to leverage that growth into higher margins and profits. ", "China remains a focal point of our international expansion efforts and last week, we opened our 500th store in China, marking an important milestone along our path toward having 1,500 stores in mainland China by 2015. In fiscal 2011, we opened on average 1 store every 4 days in China and we'll be accelerating that pace in 2012. In the fourth quarter, China delivered another very strong quarter of comp growth including a healthy increase in a number of transactions driven by the expansion of the Mooncake program and our wildly successful Frappuccino summer promotion. ", "The broader Asia Pacific region delivered similarly strong results. 2011 marked the 15th anniversary of the opening of our first Starbucks store in Japan and our business in Japan continues to recover ahead of plan from the tragic earthquake and tsunami that struck earlier this year. A few weeks ago I personally visited our partners and customers in Sendai, an area that was utterly devastated by the dual tragedy. The resilience, energy and heart stirring compassion evidenced by our partners and customers that I observed during the trip was nothing short of inspirational and reaffirm my admiration for and commitment to the Japanese people, who continue to do so much to help and take care of one another in the wake of this extraordinary catastrophe. ", "I went there specifically to help set up an emergency CUP Fund, Caring United Partners for Japan. The CUP Fund provides cash grants to help partners and their families who have been impacted by the disaster and is funded entirely by Starbucks partner donations. I want to personally extend my thanks and appreciation to the many partners around the world who have contributed to the fund. Looking ahead I am confident that our new 3 region organizational structure ideally positions us to pursue accelerated profitable international growth by having disciplined focus and experienced leadership at the helm of each of the China Asia Pacific Americas and EMEA regions.

Cliff is already demonstrating his skills and plans, having just last month strengthened and expanded Starbucks relationship with our Latin America joint venture partner enabling us to add more than 300 new stores in Mexico and Argentina by 2015. ", "And I do know that Michelle Glass, the 15-year Starbucks leader who now serves as President of the EMEA will bring her leadership skills necessary to recalibrate certain markets that are currently not meeting our expectations and profitably grow our business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa into the future. ", "Turning to CPG. Our Global Consumer Products and Foodservice teams operate on the extraordinary talent and leadership of Jeff Hansberry in a key area of strategic investment for Starbucks and a cornerstone of the blueprint for profitable growth that we outlined a year ago. I'm delighted to report that in both Q4 and throughout fiscal 2011, we made enormous strides in our channel development strategy of expanding the availability of our portfolio of branded products beyond Starbucks stores. In fact, as we speak today, Starbucks CPG products are available at more than 100,000 points of distribution around the world. ", "In 2011, we successfully transitioned Starbucks' Packaged Coffee and Tea businesses in house and materially expanded our portfolio of coffee home products through an agreement with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters. We're very excited about our partnership with Green Mountain and are looking forward to expanding our presence in the fast-growing multibillion dollar single cup category in the quarters and years ahead.", "In fact, just a few days ago at 12:01 a.m. Eastern on Tuesday November 1, 30 million Starbucks K-Cups began rolling out our distribution centers and are already appearing on grocery store shelves across the country. And over 50 million will be shipped by the end of the month. Starbucks K-Cups will be available for purchase in Canadian CPG channels beginning in March 2012 through both Starbucks and Green Mountain website starting in December 2011 and in Starbucks retail stores in the U.S. and Canada later in 2012. We are confident that Starbucks K-Cup portion pack business will grow to be a greater than a $1 billion business over time.

VIA exceeded $180 million in systemwide sales in its first year in the market and generated $250 million in systemwide sales in fiscal 2011. Today, VIA is available in 12 markets including China, the Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand, which were added just this year in over 70,000 points of distribution around the world.", "It was about a year ago that we unveiled our blueprint for growth, our unique business model that leverages the power of the Starbucks brand, our deep emotional and unique connection to consumers around the world, our 17,000-store global retail footprint and our unique ability to drive trial, build awareness and trust and draw on our CPG channel distribution capabilities to quickly reach scale in order to profitably grow the Starbucks business and plan around the world and into the future.

And good afternoon, everyone. Today we reported earnings that continue to reinforce the strength and resiliency of our business model, the global power of our brand and the talent and dedication of our partners. ", "In the fourth quarter, the U.S. international and CPG business segments all reported record Q4 revenues. In addition, on a consolidated basis, records were also achieved for revenue, operating income, operating margin and earnings per share. This was all accomplished despite continued pressure from macroeconomic headwinds and significantly high commodity cost. ", "Our performance reflects the strong connection that exists between Starbucks and the communities and customers we serve and highlights the fact that the Starbucks value proposition continues to resonate deeply with customers all around the world. Today, I will provide additional details on our fourth quarter and full year performance, then I'll provide an update to our outlook for 2012. ", "Fourth quarter consolidated net revenues were $3.0 billion, the highest of any quarter in our history and up 7% from $2.8 billion a year ago. Excluding the 53rd week in 2010, revenue growth for the quarter was 15%. Global comparable store sales continue to accelerate, increasing 9% attributable to a 6% increase in traffic and a 3% increase in average ticket. Two year same-store sales growth was 17% globally, further highlighting the momentum we're building around the world. Higher CPG revenues also contributed to the increase. ", "Consolidated operating income of $448 million in the fourth quarter increased by 12% over the $399 million reported in last year's fiscal fourth quarter, excluding the nonroutine gain in fiscal 2011, and the impact of restructuring and the extra week in fiscal 2010, we saw a 20% increase in non-GAAP operating income compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Consolidated operating margin finished the quarter at 14.8%, a 70 basis-point improvement over last year's fourth quarter on a GAAP basis. This improvement was primarily due to increased sales leverage and again on the sale of office buildings here in Seattle, partially offset by higher commodity cost and the impact of the extra week fiscal 2010. ", "On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins increased 60 basis points to 13.8% from 13.2%, which excludes the nonroutine gain in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and the impact of restructuring and the extra week in Q4 of fiscal 2010. The increase in commodity costs, largely coffee, negatively impacted operating margin in the quarter by approximately 290 basis points. Earnings per share was $0.47 for the fourth quarter, an increase of 27% over $0.37 in the prior year period. This included approximately $0.10 attributable to nonroutine gains resulting from the acquisition of the remaining equity in our Switzerland and Austria markets and the sale of office buildings here in Seattle. ", "Excluding the nonroutine gains in Q4 of fiscal 2011, and the impact of restructuring and the extra week in Q4 of fiscal 2010, EPS increased 16% to a record $0.37 per share. We absorbed approximately $0.075 per share in the fourth quarter due to higher commodity costs. Today we are announcing a 31% increase to our quarterly cash dividend to $0.17 per share from $0.13 per share and the authorization of an additional 20 million shares of our share repurchase program, bringing our total number of shares available for repurchase to just over 24 million. ", "These 2 actions reaffirm our confidence in the strength of the business and our commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders. I will now move to the results of our operating segments, which will be compared with last year's non-GAAP results that exclude the impact of restructuring and the extra week in Q4 of fiscal 2010. Please note that this will be the last quarter we report in the 3 segment structure. As we have transitioned to our new organizational model as of October 3. ", "We will provide financial restatements including 3 years of historical data under the new segment structure along with our first quarter fiscal 2012 earnings report. Total U.S. net revenues for the quarter were $2.0 billion an 11% increase over the same period last year. Both company-operated and licensed stores saw impressive gains in Q4 with a company-operated growth driven by a 10% increase in comparable store sales. The comp increase was comprised of a healthy 7% increase in traffic and a 3% increase in average ticket. 2-year comps were 18% for the quarter, our highest mark in almost 6 years. ", "Our same-store sales growth in Q4 was especially meaningful given the continued weakness in the U.S. economy and further validates that our commitment to a premium experience is resonating with our customers. Importantly, we saw strong transaction growth among all day parts in Q4 with the hours between 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. showing the highest percentage increase. This demonstrates the success we're seeing with some of our newer food offerings and indicates to us that Starbucks is increasingly recognized the our customers as an excellent option for a healthier lunch.", "Our peak morning hours also saw an impressive lift which confirms to us that we still have room for transaction growth even during our busiest time. The 3% increase in average ticket was driven by pricing and food as our petites platform and the expansion of our warming program drove incremental attachment. Operating income for the U.S. segment was $374 million, an increase of 26% compared to the same quarter last year. Operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 18.4% from 16.3%, primarily due to increased sales leverage, partially offset by higher commodity costs, which added approximately 210 basis points of cost pressure.", "We continue to be pleased with the growth and results the U.S. business is delivering and are excited about what lies ahead. Many opportunities still exist to efficiency and we are aggressively taking them on. The improvement in our work routines, efficiencies in our drive-through lanes and continued waste reduction efforts are just a few examples. We're also leveraging technology to improve our operations and full optimization of our new point-of-sale system, inventory management system and rollout of our new automated labor scheduling tool will help us deliver on our significant growth targets going forward. ", "With that, I will now move to the results from our International segment. International total net revenues increased 25% to $718 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, another Q4 record. Favorable foreign currency translation contributed roughly 1/3 of the growth with comparable store sales growth of 6% and the consolidation of the Switzerland and Austria markets also contributing. ", "The comp growth was driven by increased transactions particularly in China and Asia Pacific where comps in mainland China were once again in the mid-30s. A new contributor of revenue growth in those markets was the rollout of our loyalty program, which was implemented in South Korea in Q4 with China and Singapore added earlier in fiscal 2011. Personalized Frappuccino continued its success and in China strong customer demand for our popular seasonal Mooncakes again exceeded expectations. ", "Somewhat offsetting the same-store sales strength in Asia was softness in Europe, where the measurable decline in consumer confidence negatively impacted summer sales. Initiatives to support via service and further innovation combined with the Summer Olympics in London give us optimism that 2012 comps in Europe will improve. International operating income reached $93 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, a 21% increase. Operating margin contracted by 40 basis points to 13.0% from 13.4%. This was due primarily to higher coffee costs, partially offset by sales leverage. Commodities impact in Q4 to International was approximately 120 basis points. ", "China continues to perform phenomenally well for us and, as Howard mentioned earlier, we recently opened our 500th store on the mainland. Margins in China continue to be strong despite inflationary pressure and we believe our sales growth and focus on efficiencies will offset additional inflation in the near term. We added nearly 200 units in international markets in Q4 with many of those in Asia with combined efforts of our development and operations teams are leading solid returns on our investment. ", "In July we announced that we acquired full ownership of our retail operations in Switzerland and Austria further leveraging our existing EMEA company-operated store infrastructure. The accounting gain resulting from the transaction approximately,, $55 million, was recorded in Q4 fiscal '11 and is reported within Interest Income and Other. This transaction also had a favorable impact on our tax rate of 90 basis points for the full year and 330 basis points in Q4. ", "The exceptional sustained performance of our company operated portfolio, combined with the strength we're seeing in our license markets and the continued success of our new store openings are enabling our international retail portfolio to contribute more meaningfully to consolidated results. The recently announced organizational changes, which have energize our global team and will improve accountability and decision-making reinforce our expedition that our international business will one day rival our domestic one. ", "Further diversifying our portfolio and an important part of our growth outlook is our Global Consumer Products Group, which I'll now take a few moments to review. The conclusion of Q4 marks more than 6 months since we transitioned our packaged coffee business in-house to a direct distribution model. This model, used for our packaged coffee and tea as well as VIA Ready Brew throughout the U.S., food, drug, mass and club channels, has allowed us to take direct control of our relationship with the trade which, along with our coffee authority and brand recognition, creates an unmatched proposition in the coffee category within the grocery channel. ", "It has also laid the foundation for us to execute the highly anticipated introduction of Starbucks K-Cups in the CPG channels, which began earlier this week. In the fiscal fourth quarter, total net revenues for CPG were $242 million, an increase of 31% over last year with approximately half of the growth attributable to the transition of the packaged coffee and tea business in-house. In addition to our growing packaged coffee and tea business, the availability of VIA products continues to expand. Full year systemwide sales of VIA across all business channels reached $250 million in fiscal '11 and we reached 73% ACV in the U.S. CPG channel as of the end of the fourth quarter. ", "For the most recent 4-week period, VIA sales in the U.S. CPG channels were up more than 75% over last year, demonstrating the continuing momentum of this platform as we approach 18 months since its initial introduction in the CPG channel. Outside the U.S., we expanded VIA distribution to 6 additional countries in the China and the Asia Pacific region now reaching more than 70,000 points of distribution on a global basis. ", "The overall premium single cup category continues to grow at a rapid pace as more and more coffee consumers adopt various formats within the category. In response, retailers recognize the consumer demand and significant growth potential available and continue to dedicate more shelf space down the grocery aisle in support of this growth. CPG operating income for the quarter totaled $76 million, a 4% increase on a 13-week basis compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The operating margin of 31.4% was 800 basis points lower than the same quarter last year. Similar to the third quarter, higher coffee cost had a significant impact in the fourth quarter accounting for roughly 1,000 basis points of margin deterioration.", "As we now enter the next phase of our CPG growth plan with the introduction of Starbucks K-Cups, we remain focused on delivering premium coffee products to customers, while building strong relationships within the trade for future profitable growth. We are pleased with the results we have seen so far and believe that we are solidly on track with the aggressive growth objectives we've established for this segment. ", "I will now recap our full year fiscal 2011 performance and a few key metrics. Excluding the nonroutine gains in Q4 of fiscal 2011 and the impact of restructuring and the extra week of fiscal 2010, EPS increased 24% to record $1.52 from $1.23 per share. Higher commodity costs, largely coffee, weighed down EPS in fiscal 2011 by approximately $0.20. Global consolidated net revenues reached a record $11.7 billion in fiscal 2011 an 11% increase on a comparative 52-week basis. The increase was mostly due to an 8% increase in global comparable store sales with CPG growth also contributing. ", "Our 8% global comps were driven by a 6% lift in traffic and a 2% increase in average ticket. Same-store sales in the U.S. were 8% for the fiscal year and were 5% for the year in international. Our comp momentum remains broad-based and continued focus on the excellence of the customer experience in our stores continued expansion of the frequency driving the rewards program and robust innovation we're making both in products, like petite, and in technology, like mobile payment, are laying the foundation for future growth. ", "By driving efficiencies and heavily managing spend, we are able to flow the sales increases through to the bottom line as our fiscal 2011 consolidated operating income of $1.7 billion and operating margin of 14.8% were both records. Excluding the nonroutine gain in fiscal '11 and the impact of restructuring in the extra week in fiscal '10 operating margin expanded 100 basis points to a record 14.5%. This includes a negative 220 basis-point impact from higher commodity costs. Global store count for fiscal 2011 grew by a net 145, which is a bit misleading due to the 475 Seattle's Best Coffee locations that were closed as a result of the Borders bankruptcy. Excluding these, net unit growth was 620 new stores comprised of 131 in the U.S. and 489 new stores in the international markets. ", "We are enthusiastic about the future contribution this age class will bring as the U.S. company-operated openings are setting records for verse your sales and cash flow. Internationally, our fiscal year 2011 age class is also exceeding expectations, giving us great momentum to further accelerate unit growth in fiscal 2012 and beyond. ", "We are extremely proud of the record results we were able to deliver in fiscal 2011 despite external pressures coming from many different fronts. In the top line, we not only saw significant growth over 2010, but then improvement strengthened throughout the year, with fourth quarter global same-store sales growing at a rate not seen since 2006. During 2011 we reached 4,000 licensed stores in the U.S. and opened our 900th store in Japan. We launched personalized Frappuccino across the globe, expanded our popular loyalty program, became a leader in mobile payment, expanded VIA internationally, took back our packaged coffee business, and managed through the $0.20 EPS impact of commodities and the $0.02 impact of the Borders bankruptcy. ", "Our ability to be up in front of our competition to leverage our growth to deliver new financial accretive offering continue to confirm our belief that many opportunities remain throughout our business with significant profitable growth potential. ", "I will now give you an update to the initial fiscal 2012 outlook that was provided on last quarter's call. We continue to target revenue growth of approximately 10% for the year, driven by mid-single-digit comp growth and continued momentum of our CPG business. While we are optimistic about what the future holds for Starbucks, we also recognize that consumer environment is still fragile as our customers continue to face sustained economic pressure. We still expect full year consolidated operating margin to improve by 50 to 100 basis points over fiscal 2011 non-GAAP results. We are targeting earnings per share in the range of $1.75 to $1.82, consistent with our long-term growth target based on fiscal '11 EPS of $1.52, excluding the nonroutine gains. ", "There are a few items embedded within this target that I would like to call out. First, we continue to expect to absorb approximately $0.21 in additional commodity cost in fiscal 2012 mostly related to higher coffee prices. As you know, we took the opportunity several months ago to lock in our expected requirements for fiscal 2012. The timing of the coffee cost pressures will be heavily weighted toward the first half of the year, with $0.18 of the full year of $0.21 impacting the first 6 months. ", "As a result of that disproportionate timing of elevated coffee costs, EPS growth is expected to be approximately 5% in the first half of fiscal '12 and is expected to be approximately 25% in the second half of the year. Absent this commodity pressure we would expect strong earnings growth consistently throughout the year. Further, we have taken advantage of the recent declines in the \"C\" price to begin locking in our needs for fiscal 2013 and currently have 4 months of our 2013 requirements locked in at costs favorable to 2012. ", "Do not be misled by the expected earnings growth in the first half of 2012. It is completely a function of the timing of coffee costs flowing through the P&L compared to the previous year. The coffee cost comparison eased significantly in the second half of 2012 when we expect to deliver 25% EPS growth and then enter 2013 with extremely strong earnings momentum. Also embedded in our fiscal '12 outlook is the impact of our launch this week of take K-Cups in CPG channels. We continue to believe this addition to our portfolio will contribute $0.03 to $0.05 of incremental earnings in the year net of marketing and startup costs.", "As we have previously stated we expect sales levels for K-Cups will be limited in fiscal '12 by production capacity constraints. However, as we gain additional supply next year, we expect meaningful upside to earnings in fiscal '13 and beyond. We are very pleased with retailers' response to sponsor Starbucks as the only super premium coffee on the Keurig K-Cup platform and we're excited at the market opportunity ahead. We expect global marketing spend near 3.5% of revenues in fiscal '12, an increase over 2011 that includes full year impact of the transition of our Packaged Coffee business in-house and the rollout of K-Cup. ", "I will now give you a look at our initial segment target for 2012 based on the new organizational and reporting segment structure. In the Americas, which includes the U.S., Canada and Latin America, operating margin is expected to improve slightly over the current rate of approximately 20%. The Americas represent roughly 75% of the company's revenue. We also expect modest margin improvement in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, which currently has a margin in the mid-single digits. EMEA represents approximately 10% of Starbucks revenues. The China and Asia Pacific region currently reflecting 5% of the revenue mix of the company is expected to continue to produce strong operating margin near the 30% level. ", "Finally, we expect that Global Consumer Products Group representing approximately 10% of revenues will deliver operating margin near 25%, driven lower than historical levels due to the impact of higher coffee costs, investments in the launch of K-Cups and the ongoing buildout of the VIA platform. Our projections for global store growth remain unchanged at 800 net new stores. Based on our new structure about 400 of these will be in our Americas region, with licensed stores comprising approximately 1/2 of the new additions. Approximately 300 will be in our China and Asia Pacific region with licensed stores comprising approximately 2/3 of the new stores.", "Approximately 1/2 of the China and Asia Pacific openings will be in China. In the EMEA, we are planning on approximately 100 net new openings with licensed stores making up roughly 2/3 of the new stores. Capital expenditures are now expected to be the range of approximately $800 million to $900 million in fiscal year 2012. This is an increase to our initial target provided last quarter, reflecting additional investments in store renovations globally as well as the addition of manufacturing capacity to support our growing business. ", "We expect to renovate a record number of stores in fiscal 2012 as we continue to prioritize our in-store experience. Renovations not only add to the aesthetic experience, they also allow us to reconfigure the store to improve efficiencies in our operations. We have seen solid returns on our renovation spend over the past few years and continue to view this as another key driver to the future success of our retail operations. And finally, the tax rate in fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately 33%, modestly higher than in the previous year. ", "In closing, our fourth quarter and full year results are a testament to the talent and dedication of our partners, the strength of our business model and the power of our brand. We are delivering solid results across the globe and will continue to grow to pursue the enormous opportunity generated by the strategic investments we've made over the past few years. Our U.S. business continues to be exceptionally strong with more growth to come. ", "Internationally, we have laid the foundation for healthy profitable growth and are on the way towards operating margins in the targeted mid- to upper teens. And we're accelerating our expansion of CPG, where growth will get another boost with the launch of K-Cups this week. ", "We'll continue to invest capital in long-term profitable growth opportunities and will prudently return excess cash to shareholders. All this will improve the diversification of our portfolio and will provide customers access through more formats and in more geographies to the super premium Starbucks coffee experience. ", "With that I'd like to turn the call back to Howard for some closing comments. Howard?", "Howard D. Schultz", "Troy, thank you, before moving to the Q&A I'd like to share a few final thoughts. As I said at the outset, 2011 was an extraordinary year for Starbucks at every level. The Starbucks Experience has never been better, or profits have never been higher, our balance sheet has never been stronger and our brand has never been healthier and our connection to customers and their trust in us has never been greater.", "This week approximately 60 million customers will visit us and that's just an unbelievable number when you consider where we have come from 1987, 11 stores, 100 employees and today, 17,000 stores in 55 countries. We have purchased coffee and hundreds of products from vendors around the globe. Over 200,000 people who wear a green apron or support someone who does everyday. Starbucks is in every sense a global company. ", "Today the world is our community and Starbucks will always give back to the communities we serve. 40 years ago we set out to build a new kind of company one that strikes a delicate balance between profit and a social conscience. Striking that delicate balance remains the cornerstone of company today. Today, the world is facing one of the most challenging issues of our time, chronic high unemployment, a demoralizing and unacceptable condition, unless reversed will scar generations to come. We're doing what we can by having added approximately 3,700 net new jobs in fiscal 2011. And we plan to add approximately 12,500 net new jobs around the world in 2012. ", "We're also accelerating design and development of a new manufacturing plant here at home. But we have more to do. I've made no secret of my belief that American business leaders need to step up and address the jobs crisis head on before an entire generation is lost to hopelessness and despair. The lifeblood and engine for employment in our country has always been small entrepreneurial small businesses. Yet while small businesses have the greatest need for credit, for many reasons, today they're having greatest difficulty obtaining them. On November 1, Starbucks launched a program in partnership with the Opportunity Finance Network, in which concerned citizens could donate as little as $5 to help restart the jobs engine.", "Americans helping Americans get back to work. The Starbucks Foundation seeded the program with a $5 million donation and we hope other like-minded companies will do what they can to create and sustain as many jobs as possible. It's right for our business, it's right for our communities and it's right for country. Starbucks today is executing across all channels and around the world and we have never been better-positioned to go hard and go fast after the tremendous global opportunity that lies ahead in 2012 and beyond. In 40 years there has never been a more exciting or exhilarating time to be at Starbucks. Thank you.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Operator, we are ready to begin the Q&A please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "One question and maybe we can try it in a few different parts. Obviously the U.S. stores are doing a great job of meeting the demand that's out there, perhaps even creating demand for themselves based on what's being offered and how the stores are being run. So I just want to get a sense of things like the new point-of-sale and the labor scheduling, how much that might be driving comps and how much that might be adding to capacity in 2012, for example. And if I could, just as an extension of that, whether it's possible to start to apply some of those principles to Europe, especially given what I think I heard was a mid-single-digit margins in those regions, perhaps increasing your peak hour productivity or you're just throughput and when customers most want to the stores might be a possibility in the near term.", "Howard D. Schultz", "What I would say is, first of all, in terms of the technology in our U.S. stores, we have, as you mentioned, made significant investments into the stores: Point of sale; inventory management for the first time in our history; we are working on a new labor scheduling tool, which will come later this year; all of which are about improving the aspects of our partners lives and our stores, making the customer experience better. And ultimately, we believe all will contribute to financial results. Now there is a period of time in which we learn to really optimize all of that technology. And I would suggest that even the aggressive targets we've established for 2012 don't yet really begin to reflect the upside we think will ultimately come from those tools. I think the improvement that we would expect to see meaningfully across the system perhaps begins in 2012, but I would suggest becomes more visible really as we move into 2013 and beyond. Now what I would comment on in terms of Europe is, yes, there are a number of things that we have brought to bear in the U.S. over the past 2 years that are right now being brought to bear in whatever relative forms they are across Europe. Some of that will be technology, much of it will be operational procedures and stores, much of it will be consumer-facing kinds of activities that we think across-the-board will help us drive improvement in our EMEA business. And I would just point out that we believe we're seeing that improvement now the strongest margin improvement of any of our regions in 2012 is projected to be in EMEA and granted that's coming from a low place. But we're doing what we need to do to drive that forward. 2 or 3 years ago we had a total international business that sat with operating margins in the mid-single digits and we targeted at that point that we had a path to get to mid-upper teens. We're well on that path now and almost there, in fact. We now have the same plan in place for EMEA as a specific region, where we fully intend to do what we need to do in that region, giving opportunities we see there to move from the mid-single digits now, following to double-digit and into the mid-teens in the years ahead. So we're well on that path and we're comfortable that we have a plan to get there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Keith Siegner with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "The update on how VIA was doing that last 4 weeks I thought was really interesting and maybe you can talk about this a little bit more broadly. The shelf resets that are happening in consumer products over the next couple of months, if you could give us an idea, say, how many more SKUs might you have now having taken that business back in and introducing some new products, including K-Cups and including Blonde. If you think about '12 versus '11, how many more SKUs might you have? How much more shelf space might you have? If you could put some rough parameters around, say, some of those metrics would be really helpful.", "Howard D. Schultz", "I'm going to ask Jeff Hansberry, the President of our Consumer Products Group, also called our Channel Development team, to answer that question for you.", "Jeffery J. Hansberry", "Keith as we look at the premium single cup space as both Troy and Howard mentioned, it's growing significantly. And so as we enter the K-Cups space and as we continue to expand the VIA space, we will, in rough terms, triple or more the number of SKUs that we have in that space. So in rough terms, in 2011, toward mid-2011 I want to say we have roughly 5 VIA SKUs. We've added several new VIA SKUs to include House Blend and Breakfast Blend. We've also launched as of November 1, 7 K-Cup SKUs, 5 in the Starbucks brand, 2 in the Tazo Tea brand. So we have seen a significant increase in our number of SKUs. But importantly, we have seen a significant increase in our space on the shelf as the retailer is dedicating more and more space towards premium single cup. And importantly, they see the trend and we're seeing premium single cup represent 2/3 of the growth in the total premium coffee space and we're seeing the space allocation begin to reflect that. Also importantly, we see tremendous upside in premium single cup. Today about 8% of households have premium single cup machine in their homes. We expect that to increase significantly over the next, call it, 5 years doubling maybe even tripling. So we think there's a tremendous amount of run rate and a tremendous amount of room for us to grow through road VIA and K-Cups and other platforms that we will add over time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason West with Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wonder if you could provide a little more color on the comp outlook by region. You mentioned Europe a little bit soft in this summer. If you could talk about sort of your outlook there. Are you seeing things come back a bit now and within the mid-single digit guidance, do you expect certain regions to be above that? Obviously China may be above, but sort of how you see that guidance for the regional breakdown.", "Troy Alstead", "I won't provide specific regional comp targets just yet. It's a bit early in the year for us to do that. But let me give you a little more texture on what we saw in Q4 because there's no question that'll help shape the thinking I think about how we enter 2012. So in the fourth quarter, obviously 10% same-store sales growth in the U.S. very, very strong. Asia Pacific growth was in the mid-20s, extremely strong. And growth in China, mainland China, same-store sales growth continues to be above that, in the 30s. So we clearly continue to have a business in China and Asia Pacific that is the tops in the world in terms of same-store sales growth. And we would expect that to some degree to continue. Now there's no question that 30-plus percent comp growth can't continue forever. I believe we firmly see very, very strong trends as we come through 2011 and enter 2012. I would make a comment about Canada specifically right now in the Americas. And that's because earlier in the year, we've spoken about Canada and U.K. together being a bit softer and averaging down our international same-store sales number. Canada in the fourth quarter really began to see an uptick for us. In fact, the fourth quarter comp growth for Canada was the strongest of the entire year for Canada. That's encouraging. We think that is a good sign of the efforts our Canadian team is making and what's ahead for us in 2012 there. But again, Europe continues to be a bit soft. I think that's reflective of the broader environment. We have a number of initiatives underway in terms of things that we brought to bear in other regions and markets in the world that are in progress of being put in place in Europe, new innovations. And that all gives us confidence that we have an opportunity to drive increased strength on both the top line and the bottom line in EMEA in the year ahead but no specific targets for you at this stage.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Glass, Morgan Stanley.", "John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "What's the price point you plan to sell the K-Cups at? How quickly do you think you can reach full ACV penetration given what you said were some bottlenecks? And is any of your CapEx going toward K-Cup production or rather single-serve production, or is it left for the Bag business?", "Troy Alstead", "John, first on that CapEx, I'll answer that question. The answer is no, there's no CapEx that we need to dedicate towards K-Cups. We produce the coffee but that leverages significantly off of our current coffee roasting manufacturing plant. So no incremental capital for us to spend. And now I'll turn it to Jeff to answer the first part of your question.", "Jeffery J. Hansberry", "In terms of the price point, our frontline on K-Cups will be $1 per cup in grocery and mass outlets. With regard to going distribution, we expect to achieve 80% ACV distribution on K-Cups over time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.", "Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Obviously outstanding same-store sales in the U.S. and that business is doing great. What do you think drove that just given the tough macro environment? And any type of color around how that quarter progressed particularly with the backdrop of the macro will be helpful too.", "Troy Alstead", "Howard you want to make any comments about your thoughts about the quarter?", "Howard D. Schultz", "Yes, I never think there's one thing that drives this kind of revenue and obviously comp store sales. When you look at the backdrop of the economy against our numbers or the other retailers that did not perform as well the last few months, it's really a stunning result. I think we demonstrated a number of things not the least of which is just operational excellence, speed of service. I wouldn't dismiss the loyalty program as well as mobile because it's attracted lots more customers. I think the value proposition of us being able to integrate value into our premium pricing with Starbucks rewards program is another example. And I think we've extended day parts in a number of areas, not the least of which is what's happened with food and lunch. And I think what was said about Health & Wellness with regard to the Bistro Box is just the beginning of I think the trust that people have in the Starbucks brand and our ability to extend Starbucks products beyond coffee. And I think what really surprised us during the quarter, was Pumpkin Spice Latte, which is a product we've had many years before, to have a 40% increase is just an unbelievable number. And I think all of the questions and perhaps the cynics of a couple of years ago that believed that when McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts entered the space, they were going to have a destructive effect on Starbucks has proven to be not only not the case, but I think the more money that's been spent against the category has helped Starbucks create awareness, new customers and obviously distance between them and us. So it's not one thing. I give a lot of credit to Cliff and his field team. And I think it gives us great momentum going into the year and I think what we're most proud of is being able to put these numbers up against unbelievable significant headwinds not only about the economy but commodity costs.", "Clifford Burrows", "It's Cliff Burrows here, President of the Americas. I think one of the other things that should be noted is we've had great results across the U.S., which is a testament to the quality and stability of our leadership teams. And we are really going about our work every day of delivering a great beverage to the customer, friendly service and speed. And those 3 attributes are really important to customers really across the globe for Starbucks. And we couldn't do that without our partners putting on a green apron and showing up each day and really being welcoming and being incredibly professional and proficient around what they do. So it is really 200,000 people either serving customers with their green apron on or supporting someone who does. And that's -- in one level, it's very simple. And it's hard work and we keep doing it every day and we'll continue to focus on that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Troy, I think you mentioned in the remarks in the International segment that you characterize China, despite the inflation, as still being strong. Could we infer at least that we're -- could you be a little bit more specific? Is it improving and expanding given the strong comp trends? And then just looking at international, the margin also there, I think you made a remark that commodities are about 120 basis points and looking at the relative cog year-over-year change was a couple of hundred basis points. I'm curious, can you give us some of the other headwinds that maybe were being dealt with in that line item. Was it rates of occupancy or something of that nature of the newer stores causing a little pressure on that?", "Troy Alstead", "Matt, first of all, with respect to China what you can infer is that our margins continue very strong, we're holding them at the high levels that they are at previously despite what is inflationary pressures on our P&L just as everybody else in China is facing. And the fact that we're able to overcome that very high labor inflation and other input cost inflation on that P&L and still deliver very high store-level margins and country-level margins even after G&A, which are also extremely strong. And I would expect that someday in the future, with a bit more scale, will be among the strongest we have in the world. So yes, China continues to be very healthy for us, the expansion of our top line same-store sales as well as bringing the various efficiencies and the supply chain and operations of our stores are helping us really overcome those inflationary pressures, and I'd expect that trend to continue for some time.", "Howard D. Schultz", "Let me add one more thing about China that I think is important that is not really seen in the numbers. It's 2 things. One, the success we're having in secondary and tertiary cities is equaling or surpassing the success we've had in Shanghai and Beijing. So that gives us great optimism. The second thing is that the customer base in China today is very different than it was 12 or 5 years ago when we first opened. And that is, the customers we have today are primarily Chinese nationals. It's no longer ex-pats or American tourists, which bodes so well for the future and opportunity we have in terms of how the brand is recognized and how the brand is trusted.", "Troy Alstead", "And it's important to add to that point, Matt, that our very, very strong same-store sales growth in China is driven by transactions. These are increased frequency new customers coming in to our stores. It's not driven by pricing and that gives us extreme confidence in our ability to keep driving more volumes to those stores and continue to drive what is a great return on capital in this expanding business in the years ahead. Now overall, international far and away, the commodity cost impact is the most meaningful part which you see happening in cost of goods. There's modest pressures in a few other places that we invest in, supply chain and some occupancy cost. But not extremely meaningful nor any trends that concern us there. Clearly, commodity cost across all of our businesses the pressure we're seeing is in cost of goods.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A question on the remodel program. The 1,700 stores, is that a number for the Americas or is that a number globally? And if it is globally, could you just talk geographically, where that will be split? And besides the look of the stores, the main functional focus of the remodels?", "Howard D. Schultz", "It is U.S. stores, but Cliff you want to take that?", "Clifford Burrows", "Joe, we have 1,700 stores. That is a mix of what we would call minor refreshes usually at the 5-year mark and then mostly about 500 of these are major refurbs which are at the 10-year mark. Each time we take a look at the flow, the assets of the store and say, \"How can we improve the customer experience, the partner experience and increase capacity?\" Now that can be improving the flow, it can be putting in new equipment, whether that's the clover machine, whether that's repositioning warming ovens, whether it's putting in an extra brewer. At the same time, we also look at the third place and say, \"Can we increase seating so that we can get more people in there at peak times?\" Drive-through lanes, the length of the stack, the equipment around effectiveness and efficiency of the order and just improved flow there. Sometimes it's outside the store and it can be visibility, it can be at the patio space. And it's really a holistic view and we try and do that to bring it up to the latest view. We also obviously are looking carefully at the sustainability of the materials and lead certify on new stores we both are bringing in a local relevance to the community where the store is present. So it's all of those, Joe, that are contributing to it.", "Troy Alstead", "And to be clear, Joe, that 1,700 stores, as I think Howard mentioned, is in the U.S. We continue to put together our plan for how our learnings out of this U.S. renovation program and all the great things we've established from that in the past year or 2 as we accelerate the program, how that's applicable and how to more substantially apply some of that outside of the U.S. And so you'll see us develop those plans more meaningfully in the quarters ahead.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you talk about the relative sales which you get from the minor versus the major remodels?", "Troy Alstead", "Well, the minor remodels are generally about maintaining a stream of excellence to the consumer. And so generally, when we initially justify the capital to invest in a store, we include life cycle capital over 10 years, including the minor refreshes that may happen. So we don't go into a minor refresh expecting an uplift. Now sometimes we see that, but that's not exactly what we aim for. The major remodels, particularly more recently where we've been more substantial in what we've done and some of the sites, Joe, that I think you've seen, do contribute. I'm not ready to extrapolate over a big portfolio of stores about what that could mean. We've seen very solid top line lift from some of these major remodels and renovations, and very good return on the incremental capital that we're spending to do that. So we're encouraged by it but I wouldn't yet say there's something there you can extrapolate across the whole system.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Looking through CPG and China sort of think through, you have all these great growth opportunities in single-serve, what are the implications for the core bagged coffee? I actually would have thought your CPG business might have been up a little bit more given bringing packaged coffee in house, what the annualized revenue number might have been. So how do you think about and how should I think about cannibalization or the trade-off between the new business you're doing and the existing very good core business?", "Troy Alstead", "Sara, we'll have Jeff answer that.", "Jeffery J. Hansberry", "Sara, so in terms of the base Packaged Coffee, we think the future is very bright for Packaged Coffee. We continue to see revenue growth on Packaged Coffee in the last quarter up 7%. As we move toward, the new Starbucks Blonde Roast, we are going to be serving a significant unmet segment where 40% of premium coffee consumers prefer a lighter roast and we're going to deliver a great product in a unique Starbucks way. In addition to that, we've got a fantastic package graphic upgrade that lands in January as well that will make it easier than ever for our customers to choose their preferred roast and blend of Starbucks coffee. As we go forward, we do expect some cannibalization as our K-Cup business continues to grow. But we expect that to be modest and we expect to continue to grow our Packaged Coffee business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I have the same kind of sentiment where I hate to ask a hard question, a negative question, given how the strong quarter is. I guess what strikes me is you have so many balls in the air at once now. You've got taking back the CPG business and launching K-Cups and rejiggering the divisions and reaccelerating the unit growth and launching new products like Blonde and others. I guess my question is, where are the organizational pressure points? How are you addressing it and ensuring that with all these balls in the air, one doesn't drop? And why not take maybe a more measured approach versus all these great ideas at once?", "Howard D. Schultz", "Let me try and answer that. I think it's an appropriate question and one that I think we've asked ourselves. But I think in order to answer it I want to bring some texture. In 2008, 2009, when we were dealing with the cataclysmic financial crisis and navigating through our own self-induced mistakes that we had to own up to, I think the transformation of the company was twofold: One, it was consumer-facing in developing new ways to provide operational excellence and innovation. But I think we also developed significant new disciplines and muscle memory into the company in order to create not only a new organizational structure but a new way to operate the business. And when I say in my remarks that the company is healthier from a financial perspective, that's one thing. We're also healthier in terms of the talent that has come into the company and the organizational proficiency that we've created over the last 2, 3 years in order to navigate through both the downturn in the economy. Most importantly, I think great companies build and take market share during downturns in the economy. I think right now, our approach is to leverage the unique assets that Starbucks has that we think is quite unique and maybe something that no other company has, and that is the ability to create multiple channels of distribution leveraging the equity of the brand and our ability to introduce products and sub-brands into our stores. So we don't view it as something new to us or more than any other time before. What we look at is opportunities that we have that we think are well within our reach in terms of the organizational talent and capabilities and market opportunities to do things that haven't been done before. If you look at VIA, you look at Blonde, you look at K-Cups, all 3 of those categories are within our core business and that's coffee. All we're doing is bringing innovation and new channels of distribution. If you look at International, we've been in the International business since 1996 and the core expansion for the company, the core target and prize is China. We've been there 12 years and we've got a super team that is Chinese nationals that we believe that are in place in order to really grow that business. And when you look at the retail business, this is something we've been doing for 40 years. We've just gotten better at it and we've learned through the innovation of new stores, new designs and new formats that we can create incremental revenue, incremental profit. And we also think this is a time that we are deeply committed to creating separation and distance between ourselves and everyone else in our space. And then you couple that with the innovation in terms of technology that we're bringing both to the Card program and mobility. If you look at just the last 6 months, we have done more revenue and more transactions on smartphones than any other brand in America. And we're going to take full advantage of the connectivity through the channels distribution in the technology and the opportunity that we have overseas. I will say and just in closing because it's a little long-winded, that we were humbled by what happened in the past. And I personally and I speak for everyone on the team, we're not going to allow ever again at Starbucks for growth to cover up mistakes. We're not going to have unbridled growth that is turned into a strategy as opposed to a purpose. And the kind of growth we're talking about is 10% growth but it's a new kind of growth. It's a new blueprint for growth leveraging new channels of distribution and we have at our fingertips multiple billion-dollar businesses: K-Cups, Starbucks VIA, Starbucks Blonde Roast and obviously we're in the early nascent stages of International and specifically China.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just I guess a 2-part question on International. I think we're still sticking with kind of mid to high teens long-term margin goal. Just to clarify, I believe in that mid-single digit right now in EMEA and 30% in Asia, so I'm just wondering obviously with that disparity, what you'd see to be the pace of growth in both those segments perhaps in 2012 within that I guess 50 to 100 basis points worldwide, and what the longer-term target is that's going to get you to that -- longer term by region, I should say, that was going to get you to mid- to high teens. And whether or not you're going to touch on the U.K. In the last time you mentioned, I guess the comps were still tracking positive although disappointing. I'm just wondering if you could give us some directional trends on the U.K. and the issues that are perhaps out of your control.", "Troy Alstead", "There's a lot there so I'll try to go through it and remember it as I can. In terms of how we expect International to progress towards a mid- to upper teens. As I mentioned earlier in my comments, China and Asia Pacific is already very, very strong as a region. And we expect over time, as we grow rapidly, to be able to maintain the current margin structure of that region largely somewhere in the 20s. It's got very strong store-level profitability. We don't have yet scale in China, so we know over time the country level margins in China should grow further for us. I would just point out also that there's an important contributor right now to our margin structure in the China and Asia Pacific region. We haven't said much it, and that's Japan. And much of that has to do with how we operate in Japan, which is a joint venture that we own 40% of. We do not consolidate the top line revenue of that business but it is our largest market in China and Asia Pacific, produces very significant profitability that we pick up 40% of that JV income. And also growth out of that license business, which comes with it. As a result, a very, very strong licensed margin that adds into the China and Asia Pacific margin structure. So the margins for in Asia is both about strength in China as we grow and it's also about the very, very strong healthy business in Japan, that's a license market for us today. In EMEA, that is the place in the world where we would expect the biggest increase over time from where we are today and that's given that, that market, that region is not where it should be today. And we have plans in place to move it north from the mid-single-digit that it's at now. Sometime in our future, and I've said this before, we would expect EMEA, given what we can see in terms of the opportunity, the plans we have in place to drive margin improvement over time, to progress, again this is over time, toward the mid-teens. And we think we have a very healthy path to get there and we have some countries already operating at that place that gives us confidence that we can do that. Again China and Asia Pacific, I would expect to be north of that well into the 20s, higher than what we see in the Americas. And then in the Americas, largely about the U.S. but importantly, in the future increasing contributions out of Canada, places like Brazil as we grow rapidly. I would also expect very, very strong healthy margin contribution there. So that contribution over time across those regions is how I would still be confident in us progressing towards that mid- to upper teens.", "Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "[indiscernible] in U.K. specifically or...", "Troy Alstead", "Yes, I think what I'd tell you about the U.K. is that, and we've said this throughout this year, that the U.K. has been relatively softer for us, consistent with other parts of Europe to some extent, than say what we've seen in the Americas in China Asia Pacific. In the fourth quarter that continued. U.K. is positive, it is growing, we have positive same-store sales growth. But it is somewhat lower than what we see, for example, now in Canada and clearly lower than what we have in the U.S. And again I think that is reflective to a large degree of the environment there. We expect, as we move into 2012 given the number of innovations we have lined up for the U.K. and we're confident in our ability to capitalize on the prominence of the Olympics in London this coming summer that all those pieces together will help us drive a stronger same-store sales growth in the U.K. and continue to drive margin improvement in that region.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "You mentioned the lower earnings growth in the first half due to cost in the Green Coffee cost side I think specifically. Between your CPG division and your retail stores, your own stores, where are you accepting more margin impact as defined by inflation that is not being offset by pricing? And really related to that, I really wonder why Starbucks should ever accept dollar impact to profit from Green Coffee inflation when you have such a strong brand and relatively higher-income consumers? I sure see a lot of pricing going on out there.", "Troy Alstead", "Let me speak, David, to the first part of it. And then I'll probably ask Jeff to speak a little bit to our pricing strategy and what we're doing there because I think that addresses the back part of your question. In terms of margin, the biggest margin hit, cost of goods hit from commodity cost, particularly coffee cost, is in our CPG segment. And that's largely because coffee cost are a bigger component of the cost structure in CPG than of course they are in our retail stores. And so our retail stores have more levers in the rest of the P&L to pull to help overcome that coffee cost and we've been able to do that as we -- despite the pressures we have faced over the past year, have improved margins in our stores. In the CPG channel however, we did see margin deterioration in the fourth quarter, very consistent with kind of margin deterioration we saw the third quarter, and that was completely due to coffee cost. Absent the coffee cost impact, we would have margins very consistent with previous year and very much on the pace of coffee costs [ph]. Now I would also just point out, even with the coffee costs that we're absorbing in CPG, it's an extremely healthy margin business, at plus 30% in the quarter we just ended and 25% or better in the year ahead that we see. So it's a very healthy margin business even with coffee costs where they are. I'll ask Jeff to speak a bit to pricing and your point about why we would accept any deterioration as a result of that.", "Jeffery J. Hansberry", "We continually look at price and we have taken price of about 12% in 2011. At the same time however, we see tremendous upside and potential to grow the Starbucks brand. So we are working to maintain a price point that will continue to drive growth on the Starbucks brand. And again importantly, we're constantly looking at pricing. And we think we're in a very good spot right now.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "That concludes today's call. Thank you for joining us. We'll talk to you again when we report first quarter earnings in January 2012.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Starbucks Coffee Company's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Thank you for joining us today for a review of our first quarter fiscal 2012 financial results. ", "This is our first earnings report under our new reporting segments, and we'll take the opportunity today to let you hear directly from 2 of the segment presidents on results from their respective businesses. We'll start our call with comments from Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO. Troy Alstead, our CFO, then speak to consolidated results. Jeff Hansberry, President of CPG, Foodservice and Seattle's Best Coffee, will discuss results for these businesses, followed by Cliff Burrows, President of our American segment. Troy will then wrap things up with a look at Europe, Middle East, Africa and China/Asia-Pacific results and a review of our targets before we move to Q&A.", "Our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release, and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.", "Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to the financial statements accompanying the earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website at starbucks.com under Investor Relations. ", "Before we turn the call over to Howard, let me cover a few housekeeping matters. Historical results recapped under the new reporting segments can be found under the Investor Relations segment of starbucks.com. In addition to the P&Ls we initially filed and posted late last week, we added 3-year historical same-store sales data and store counts. Also, please note that we filed the company's 2012 proxy statement today, which can also be found on our website. And finally, Starbucks' 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held in Seattle at 10 a.m. Pacific Time on Wednesday, March 21. That meeting will also be available via webcast. ", "With that, please let me turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?", "Howard D. Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on the call. We are delighted to report Starbucks' first quarter of fiscal 2012 results we announced earlier today. Q1 was an outstanding quarter for Starbucks on many levels. We served more customers in our stores around the world than at any other time in our history, and our financial performance indicates that we delivered on every key performance metric, to drive our ninth consecutive quarter of positive comps, including 9% growth in U.S. comparable store sales and 9% increase in global comparable store sales, a 7% increase in customer traffic and the strongest holiday season in our 40-year history, record quarterly revenues of $3.4 billion and record quarterly earnings of $0.50 per share. ", "Combined with the growing strength and global relevancy of the Starbucks brand, our performance in Q1 was driven by continued product and beverage innovation, continued focus on operating excellence, fiscal discipline, deepening our connection to customers, elevating our customer experience and extraordinary execution by Starbucks' partners in all 57 countries around the world, in which we operate. Yet it's gratifying as our results last quarter were, we are even more motivated by the global opportunity that lies ahead, both in terms of growth of our store footprint and the growing opportunity within CPG. ", "By now, you know that in October, Starbucks implemented a new leadership and organizational structure, the centerpiece of which, is a new 3-region global alignment of our retail business. This move was designed to support an acceleration of Starbucks' long-term blueprint for profitable growth, a global growth strategy we first shared with you in December of 2010 at our biannual analyst conference. ", "The Starbucks' blueprint for growth is proving to be a differentiated and unique approach that allows us to integrate and build off of our global retail footprint, our deep and unique connection with our customers and our rapidly-expanding CPG business. While some companies may be able to execute some portions of this strategy, we strongly believe that Starbucks is the only company in the world with a global footprint of company-owned and operated stores, a growing CPG business, best-in-class social and digital media assets, a cutting-edge experience with mobile payment and millions of registered Starbucks cardholders as part of our loyalty program. ", "These assets, along with our management talent and the underlying trust in the equity of our brand, allows us to introduce a new product or category within our stores, and draft off of that success to then build multiple channels of profitable distribution, as part of our CPG strategy. ", "We have built and we are executing a synergistic model that we first initiated through the introduction of Starbucks VIA. Beyond product success and importance to our global single-cup strategy, VIA demonstrated that Starbucks has the unique ability to leverage our global retail footprint, and unique connection with customers to create and grow a completely-new CPG product category. And VIA was, in many ways, the proof source for our blueprint for growth strategy. ", "In 2010, we aspired to build VIA into a billion-dollar brand, and today, we are well down that path. In its first year, VIA achieved $185 million of systemwide sales, and generated more than $250 million in systemwide sales in fiscal 2011, with over 80,000 points of distribution. The confidence and muscle memory we have developed with VIA is now being applied in our approach to new opportunities. ", "The pent-up demand and growing customer response to the launch of the Starbucks K-Cup portion packs last November, is another illustration of our blueprint for growth at work. But unlike VIA, we inverted the model and the sequence of events. We launched K-Cups nationwide first in CPG, shipping over 100 million K-Cup packs, to every region of the country. Building off of that success later this year, we will bring K-Cups to our own retail stores, timing this availability with the additional supply that is required to meet the increasing demand in this exciting new area of business. ", "We strongly believe that as we garner additional supply, and continue to execute against our channel rollout plan, we will build a second billion-dollar business within our single-serve portfolio, adjacent to the billion-dollar opportunity we see for VIA. ", "And on January 10, we rolled out Starbucks' latest innovation, Starbucks Blonde Roast. The question might be asked why is Blonde so significant? Because Blonde provides us with a major new product platform within our core business, to deliver the Starbucks' premium coffee experience to a significant contingent of coffee drinkers that is completely incremental to our existing business, consumers preferring a lighter roast representing 40% of all coffee drinkers in the U.S. alone. ", "What's more, following our blueprint for growth, we're launching Blonde differently than we have launched any other product in Starbucks' history, across all channels in our stores and within tens of thousands of points of distribution within CPG and around the world. And as you can see today, Starbucks' blueprint for growth is guiding everything we do and we are just getting started. ", "For example, as we speak, we are applying the full talent and muscle of our creative, strategic, social media and operational expertise to our major new entry into the $50 billion health and wellness industry, as we build a national brand with Evolution Fresh. We have exciting news to share on this front in the weeks and months ahead, as we finalize plans for the debut of our Evolution Fresh health and wellness store in the first half of 2012. We're not ready to announce details today but I can assure you, we are incubating a concept unlike anything else in the marketplace today. We look forward to sharing a detail of our vision with you, so please stay tuned. ", "Before I turn the call over to Troy, Jeff and Cliff, I'd like to close by thanking our nearly 200,000 Starbucks partners around the world for all they have done to deliver yet, another record quarter and set in motion what is shaping up to be another defining year on many fronts for Starbucks Coffee Company. As we continue to execute at this high level and pace, I couldn't be more proud that what we are doing -- that while we're doing all this, we're doing it in a way which we are preserving our core values in enhancing the connection to the communities we live and where we work, in a sense, using our scale through good [ph]. ", "With that, I thank you for the opportunity and I'll turn the call over to Troy.", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks entered fiscal 2012 with strong momentum, which we carried through our fiscal first quarter, with records being set for many critical measures of our financial health. As Howard mentioned, our blueprint for growth is taking hold, and now beginning to payoff in a big way. ", "Record revenues, operating income and earnings are testaments to this, and as you'll hear on this call, we have a great deal of opportunity ahead. I'm going to quickly give you an overview of consolidated results, and I will turn to Jeff and Cliff for more details on their businesses. ", "First quarter consolidated net revenues were $3.4 billion, up 16% from $3.0 billion a year ago. The revenue increase was primarily driven by a 9% increase in comparable store sales, attributable to a 7% increase in traffic and a 2% increase in average ticket. Two year global comp reached 16% in the first quarter. ", "We reported consolidated operating income of $556 million in the first quarter, an 11% increase over the first quarter of last year. Consolidated operating margin was 16.2%, which represented an 80 point decline from the first quarter of last year. Higher commodity costs were particularly impactful in the quarter, having a negative impact on operating income of $105 million and 300 basis points of pressure on margin. Even with this headwind, EPS reached a record $0.50 per share for the first quarter compared to $0.45 per share on last year's Q1, an 11% increase. ", "I'm now going to turn the call over to Jeff Hansberry, who will take us through the remarkable results of our CPG business in the first quarter, and will give you some insights into what's to come in this high-growth area of our company. Jeff?", "Jeffery J. Hansberry", "Thank you, Troy. We saw strong results amongst our portfolio of branded products in the first fiscal quarter of 2012, even as we continue to reinvest in the business for future growth opportunities. Record quarterly revenue of $336 million was a 72% increase over last year, driven equally by growth of the premium single-cup segment and the benefit of recognizing the full revenue in our packaged coffee and tea business, under the direct distribution model. ", "Operating income for the quarter was $80 million, up 12% over the prior year, and operating margin was 23.7%. This is roughly in line with our fiscal year '12 target, driven 950 basis points lower, due to higher coffee costs, which as you know, have had a significant impact on this segment -- have a significant impact on this segment more than any other. ", "I would like to provide some additional detail on our key CPG product lines. Our packaged coffee and tea businesses continue to improve, as we approach the anniversary of the transition to our direct distribution model. Despite a consumer shift toward single-serve formats, we did see positive share turns within the packaged coffee segment in the first quarter. We are well positioned to maintain and elevate our leadership in this space through new offerings like Blonde Roast, which I'll talk about more in a minute. Our recently-launched simplified new package -- packaging organized by Roast profile and stronger management of the channel with our direct selling team. ", "Next, I'd like to discuss the premium single-cup category, which is without question, the most dynamic segment in the coffee category, with overall growth of more than 130% in the most recent 13-week syndicated data period. Starbucks continues to build share in this category, first with our introduction of VIA, and more recently, with the launch of Starbucks K-Cups. Customer demand for VIA continues to be strong with ACV now in almost 80%. In the first quarter, we added 2 new VIA flavors, House Blend and Breakfast Blend to our CPG offerings, with even more on the way in the near future. We will also continue to expand the availability of VIA, both in the U.S. and abroad. ", "Now let me move to Starbucks K-Cups, where we are very pleased with the consumer excitement around our recent launch in the U.S. CPG channel. For the 2 months in the quarter in which Starbucks and Tazo K-Cup packs were available, over 100 million cups were shipped, and we have already reached an 11% value share in the premium single-cup market, with 66% ACV in the month of December. As we gained additional supply, we expect to see continued positive momentum in both of these areas. Looking forward, in Q2, we plan to launch K-Cups in the Canadian CPG channel, and later in the year, we will roll out the products in Starbucks retail stores in both the U.S. and Canada. ", "Another area that we are excited about is our acquisition of Evolution  Fresh, a superpremium juice company. With this acquisition, we will reinvent the $1.6 billion superpremium juice segment by providing our customers even more healthy options for their on-the-go lifestyles. The rollout of Evolution juice products represent a significant entry point into the large $50 billion health and wellness sector. The integration of Evolution into our business is moving along as scheduled, and we will share more information on this front in the near future. ", "Most recently, we introduced Starbucks Blonde Roast, a lighter roast of our premium coffee, simultaneously, through both our U.S. retail stores and the CPG channels. With over 54 million coffee drinkers in the U.S. preferring a lighter flavor profile, the new Blonde offering serves as an example of our ability to listen to and respond to our customers, providing them with the products they prefer, wherever and whenever they want them. The new platform is now offered in the U.S. CPG channel in whole bean and ground coffee formats, VIA and K-Cup. These new products will allow us to increase our share of the brewed coffee market down the grocery aisle, where a majority of coffee sales are in the light and medium roast categories, representing a $1 billion opportunity in the U.S. alone. ", "In conclusion, as I look back on where the Starbucks CPG business was just one short year ago, it is amazing how much we have accomplished in such a short amount of time. We have revolutionized the way people think about and consume coffee at home, at work and on the go. We are driving rapid growth for the company through this part of the business, which requires relatively low capital investment. And looking forward, I remain enthusiastic about the health and continued growth opportunities of the entire Starbucks CPG business. The capabilities and experience we are building within our internal team has allowed us to concurrently and thoroughly deliver on all areas I've just covered, and will ensure that Starbucks remains the market leader when consumers shop for premium coffee products in the CPG channel. ", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Cliff Burrows, President of the Americas. Cliff?", "Clifford Burrows", "Thanks, Jeff. I'm pleased to share with everyone today, the very strong results of the Americas Retail business. Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty, high unemployment and rising inflationary pressure, the Americas team continues to deliver exceptional results. Our business has never been healthier as both financial and customer metrics are extremely positive, and we've just had the most successful holiday season in our history. ", "Total Americas net revenues for the quarter was $2.6 billion, an 11% increase over the same period last year. Company-operated comps were 9% for the quarter, with 7% coming from increased transactions and 2% from an increase in average ticket. U.S. same-store sales were 9% for the quarter, including transaction growth of 8% and ticket growth of 2%, with strong contributions coming from across the country. And we're pleased to see Canada showing signs of renewed strength with very solid comps, following several quarters of lower, although still positive comps. ", "Our same-store sales, we generated mainly from a holiday program that resonated with our customers. Our holiday trio: peppermint mocha, gingerbread latte and caramel brul\u00e9e latte, highlighted our seasonal beverage offerings, which delivered the 20% growth over the last year, and our warming program also continues to show strength with 31% sales growth over last year. ", "Average daily transactions per store in the U.S. for the first quarter surpassed our previous record, which was set in 2006, as throughput continues to benefit from initiatives put in place over the past 2 years.  The Starbucks Card and our mobile payment app are supporting increased frequency, and will contribute to second quarter revenue growth, as U.S. customers loaded $0.5 billion on their cards in December alone, that's 23% more than last December. We also gained another 413,000 new members to the My Starbucks Rewards program in December, bringing total membership to more than 3.7 million, and today, we're seeing 1 in 4 customers use their Starbucks Card for tender. ", "Store managers have also helped us become more efficient, as U.S. store productivity in December hit record highs. Our partners are working together to create a culture of coaching, problem solving and change in leadership. Our 2012 key initiatives of staffing and scheduling, inventory management and a consistent method of work to deliver increased capacity, enables an improved experience for our customers and partners. Together, our sustained progress in these areas helped us deliver a world-class customer experience. ", "In addition to increasing capacity during morning peak, we have driven additional business throughout the day, by efforts such as the successful launch of Bistro Boxes Petite, and special promotions such as Frappuccino Happy Hour and Treat Receipt in the U.S. We have growth opportunity in our drive-through stores, which now make up nearly 40% of our U.S. portfolio, the opportunity to improve transaction times and increased throughput. This is why we're focusing on this area like never before. ", "Brand-new technology such as wireless mobile payment scanners, building efficiency driving improvements in our drive-through renovations, and testing many other ideas to improve the customer experience through this expanding platform. Our success is not limited to the U.S. company-operated stores, we're also seeing fantastic results from our licensed stores. Revenue in our Americas licensed stores were up 25% in the first quarter over last year, and in U.S., we're seeing double-digit revenue growth across all license partnerships, including airports and grocery locations, where we offer a Starbucks Experience for those on the go. ", "Operating income for the Americas segment was $563 million in Q1, an increase of 7% compared to the same quarter last year. Operating margins contracted 80 basis points to 21.8%, from the record of 22.6% last year due to higher commodity costs, primarily coffee and that reduction and that impact was approximately 240 basis points. This cost pressure was partially offset by sales leverage. ", "The Americas region, the most mature and largest for Starbucks, will remain focused on growth. We're well underway to have 400 net new stores this calendar year. The majority of that will be in the U.S., where we have a solid pipeline of stores that will be LEED certified and are expected to produce strong returns. ", "In Canada, we're beginning to see signs of economic recovery, particularly in the east. The recent launch of the My Starbucks Rewards program was an important step to continuing to drive frequency among those loyal customers. We now have more than 500 stores open in Latin America, and comp sales are healthy in all major markets. In Mexico, where we have more than 300 stores, we will celebrate the 10th anniversary in September, and we have increasing confidence in the potential for Starbucks in Brazil, supported by strong comps and exceptional new stores opened in Q1. ", "Additionally, we are pleased to announce today that we'll be bringing the Starbucks Experience to customers in Costa Rica this May. We have a long relationship with this country, given our farmer connections and are pleased to finally have a retail presence there as well. ", "We're in the early days of our Blonde Roast launch, which is generating a lot of pride from our partners, but they're now able to offer our customers a Starbucks coffee with a lighter roast. We look forward to launching this offering beyond U.S. and Canada. ", "I look forward to working with all the markets in this high-performing region to deal with our customers, our value for our customers and rewards to our partners and shareholders. In closing, I would like to thank all our store partners across the Americas for their dedication and hard work each and every day. ", "With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Troy. Troy?", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, Cliff. The next thing I will discuss is Europe, Middle East and Africa, which delivered revenue growth of 17% in the first quarter. As I commented on a recent conference call outlining the changes to our segment reporting, we're targeting this region as a big opportunity, both on the top line and throughout the P&L. ", "We are underperforming against our expectations in this critical part of the world, and we have a solid plan in place to turn this region around. The first step in that plan was to put an experienced talented leadership team in place, which is what we did by appointing Michelle Glass, a 15-year Starbucks partner, to be president of this region. Michelle's played an integral role in the development and execution of Starbucks' transformation agenda, which was the strategic basis of our U.S. business turnaround that began in 2008. ", "With the right leadership in place, we're going to focus on what matters most, our coffee, our partners and the store experience. On all these fronts, we'll do what we need to in order to turn things around. The second and third quarters will include foundational investment that will be reflected in lower margins in those periods, but as we come out of these implementation costs, we're targeting margin improvement to mid-single digits in fiscal 2012, declining over time to the midteens. ", "Same-store sales growth in EMEA in the first quarter was 2%, with increased transactions of 2% and a higher average ticket of 1%, despite a worsening consumer outlook and high unemployment in many markets across Europe. In the U.K., we recorded our 10th consecutive quarter of positive comps, boosted this quarter by a highly successful holiday campaign. The overall revenue growth of 17% for the EMEA region was driven primarily by the consolidation of the Switzerland and Austria markets, with a 2% comp and its licensed store revenue growth of 18% also contributing. ", "EMEA margin contracted 320 basis points in the first quarter, due largely to transitionary costs of bringing in-house the distribution of fresh food and dairy in the U.K. This is an important change that will improve the freshness and delivery efficiency of products to our stores. Higher commodity costs have also added 60 basis points of unfavorability. ", "In China and Asia-Pacific or CAP, the strong momentum that built throughout 2011 continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Net revenues increased by 38%, driven largely by rapid new store growth, along the same-store sales growth of 20%. The strong comps were comprised of a 15% increase in transactions and a 5% increase in average ticket. All 4 of our company-owned markets in CAP posted double-digit comps, with China leading the way at 28%. ", "We have now recorded greater than 20% comps for 6 consecutive quarters in China. Consistent with results across our global store base, the holiday platform produced very solid results as well. Additionally, we're gaining traction on our loyalty program, with nearly 250,000 My Starbucks Rewards members already signed up in China. Strong holiday merchandise sales contributed to the higher average ticket. ", "Operating income in CAP was also strong, increasing 26% to $58 million in the first quarter. Operating margin contracted 350 basis points to a still outstanding 34.6%, resulting from higher performance-based compensation, higher costs necessary to fuel our expansion in this region, as well as 200 basis points related to higher commodity costs. While store operating expenses and costs increased, we saw solid leverage on occupancy and depreciation from the additional sales. ", "I want to provide a bit of additional texture on Japan in particular, as it is important for its contribution to this region to be fully understood. At 950 stores, Japan makes up 1/3 of the region store count, and makes up approximately 40% of CAP operating income. It only comprises about 13% of revenue, however, due to the ownership structure. Japan is a joint venture market for us, with Starbucks owning 40%, our partner, SAZABY, owning 40% and 20% being publicly held. The revenue that is recognized on CAP's P&L for Japan, includes royalties on sales in our Japan stores and sales of coffee, tea and other strategic products sold to the joint venture. Our stake of the equity, essentially 40% of the market after-tax profit, which recorded in the income from equity investee's line of the CAP P&L. ", "From a performance standpoint, Japan continues to show improvement in revenue, operating income and operating margins. It was just 10 months ago that Japan was faced with a devastating earthquake and tsunami. We are extremely proud of the way that our Japan partners have responded, as that market has recovered faster than expected, and did so, while being a significant contributor to relief efforts around the country. With a very strong brand, powerful store economics and significant growth opportunities, Japan will continue to be a strong contributor to the region's success in the coming years. ", "Given the consistency of strong results in China/Asia-Pacific, we're going to continue to accelerate growth in the region. We opened 121 net new stores in Q1, the highest of our 3 retail regions. The growth came from 48 net new stores in mainland China, where we continue to see extremely strong returns that are surpassing our initial projections. Sales to investment ratio in mainland China is more than 2.5:1, and first-year, cash-on-cash returns are the highest in our system. Better store growth contributors in CAP in Q1 included South Korea, where we opened 24 net new stores and Japan with 15 net new stores. ", "Now, I'd like to give you an update on our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. We continue to target revenue growth of approximately 10% for the year, driven by mid-single digit comp growth and continued momentum of our CPG business. We expect full year consolidated operating margin to improve by 50 to 100 basis points over fiscal 2011 non-GAAP results. ", "Given the strong performance in the first quarter, we have raised our expectations for earnings per share to the range of $1.78 to $1.82, representing 17% to 20% growth over fiscal '11 EPS of $1.52, excluding the non-routine gains. The expected impact due to higher commodity costs in FY '12 remained virtually unchanged from what I've told you in November, approximately $230 million. We continue to expect a greater impact from commodities on the first half of the year, easing a bit during the second half. ", "With that expected impact of commodities, we're targeting 10% earnings growth in the first half of the year, with 25% growth in the second half. We've taken advantage of the recent declines in the seed price to lock in more of our coffee needs for fiscal 2013, and now has 6 months of our fiscal 2013 requirements secured at costs markedly favorable to 2012. The specific year-over-year cost improvement is still too early to quantify, as we still have half of 2013 open. I will provide additional commentary in coming quarters as we lock in more of our coffee needs. ", "As you heard Jeff discuss during his remarks, we continue to be excited about the opportunity ahead of us with regard to K-Cups. Given our current visibility into production capacity, we're targeting the high end of the $0.03 to $0.05 incremental per share range that was provided on our last call, as the FY '12 contribution from K-Cups. On a segment basis, our store count projections remain unchanged for fiscal 2012 at 800 net new stores. ", "Operating margin for our Americas business is still expected to improve slightly over FY '11's 20%. EMEA is expected to show modest improvement over its FY '11 margin. CAP margin guidance remains at nearly 30%, and CPG margin also remains unchanged from our previous target of near 25%, lower than FY '11, largely due to the impact of higher coffee costs. ", "We continue to expect marketing expense near 3.5% of revenue for the full year, a meaningful increase over a year ago. That marketing expense will be more pronounced in Q2 due to the rollout of Blonde Roast. ", "Our first quarter was tremendous in nearly every measure, thanks to the continued focus and hard work of our dedicated partners. We have proven a unique ability to be immediately relevant in the marketplace, as demonstrated by our impressive launch of K-Cups in November. We've proven the ability to be nimble and flexible. The multichannel launch of Starbucks Blonde Roast is an example there. We've proven an ability to be focused and disciplined as our record productivity and transaction levels in the U.S. demonstrate, despite a still challenging economic backdrop. We've proven an ability to be innovative with the global launch of our Petite platform and additional countries launch in the frequency-driving My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, including Canada and the U.K. just recently. ", "And importantly, we continue to drive shareholder value in all the various ways I've described. As Howard, Jeff and Cliff mentioned before me, we're not slowing down one bit in 2012. ", "With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. David?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Palmer of UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Want to ask the question just about the U.S. business. The traffic momentum there is pretty great, 8% growth. The check was also not quite as high as I might have thought it would be, given the fact that you seem to do well with some of the premium drinks, and you were doing a lot with food earlier in the quarter, and I would have thought that would've carried into the quarter. Could you give any hints as to maybe what's going on with that check there? And then separately, with that amazing traffic, is there any insight beyond that -- the trio of holiday drinks? I can understand those would be doing well. But there are things beyond that like the Starbucks Reward, the point-of-sale systems helping throughput that it can help us get our heads around this traffic.", "Clifford Burrows", "It's Cliff here. This whole piece around focusing on throughput and focusing on the basics of the customer experience is really our outstanding priority, overriding priority. And we know the customer continues to seek value, and their engagements in the My Starbucks Rewards program is really a big part of this. And we are increasing frequency of visits, and obviously, there are benefits attached to the My Starbucks Rewards program, and obviously, our growth on ticket, the net growth. The other thing that I have to say is that we have pulled back somewhat over recent years in our merchandise range around holiday time focusing on cold products like our holiday trio and like our foods. And all of that has really helped. So the focus is on the frequency and on transactions, and we're seeing good growth across the U.S. We continue to benefit from the improved technology, whether that was the introduction of Symphony, whether that is the introduction of the scanners or the applications for iPhone and Android, all of those are increasing the opportunity. The other area where we're seeing good growth which is helping ticket, is on Christmas Blend coffee. We had a very, very strong season there. And if you remember, we took price in July on whole bean, and that also came through at both the Christmas Blend, whole bean coffee and our VIA coffee Christmas and both of those benefited. So we're pleased with the mix, we're pleased with the focus and we will continue to work on throughput and on attach of products like food.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I have a question about some of the margins. Just trying to work through the operating leverage opportunity for some of them. Obviously, I understand that CAP, it's mostly mix shift coming out, left [ph] Japan and more company-operated. But store operating expenses maybe weren't quite -- didn't quite see the leverage I would have expected, and maybe I could say the same thing about CPG. So can you just help me figure out whether this is mix shift versus incremental spending, whether it's a marketing or incentive comp, or basically, something else that I'm not thinking about? Because you had great, great top line, and obviously, I understand the commodities issue but just trying to get a sense of how to bucket these things?", "Troy Alstead", "Let me start and let me call some of my -- Cliff or Jeff here to speak a little bit about their businesses as well. We're actually -- we're very pleased with the flow-through in the margins we saw delivered to the bottom line in the quarter, given the headwinds that we faced in coffee. And I appreciate your question, we'll do our best to answer it. But on balance, we drove margin improvement in a quite significant way across the business, absent the 300 basis points of commodity cost pressures. And just on that point, before I hit the margins for a moment, this quarter we just ended is the single biggest peak of year-over-year coffee costs we will face, and we're quite pleased that we found our way through this challenge and delivered the kind of earnings growth in margin delivery that we did despite what is an extreme coffee cost pressure, in the quarter and the first half of this year. And CPG in particular, the business is most impacted by coffee cost, and so the decline in margins we saw there, is consistent with what we told you to expect back on our November call in terms of the target for the year, right around the mid-20s. And again, that's heavily impacted by more so than any of the business segments by coffee costs. In the U.S. and other regions, I'll perhaps talk to Cliff to speak a little bit more about productivity and the flow-through that we're seeing in that business.", "Clifford Burrows", "Yes, and it really was, Sara, a very strong performance across all areas in the U.S. And again, as Troy says, we were very pleased that we're able with productivity gains, and we were serving more people in December per hour than we have ever done in our history. And that is how we managed to overcome the increased -- significant increase in coffee prices and other pressures, whether it's cocoa, dairy or fuel. All of those have an impact, so we were pleased with the quarter.", "Troy Alstead", "One last thing I'll say to your question Sara, to make sure we get it all. You asked about China/Asia-Pacific, and you're correct there, that as we've talked about in previous quarters, we fully expect and did experience in the quarter, margin improvement at the country level, and we would expect this to continue to grow in China/Asia Pacific with the phenomenal economics that we have there and the great top line growth we're experiencing, that will continue to drive margin improvement country by country. There is a mix shift going on, as you've referenced, it's just important to recognize that it happen over time, as we grow extremely rapidly in the company-owned businesses. In China, there will be some dilution of the highly licensed revenue business that comes out of Japan. It's not a bad thing, that's actually a great measure of our success in China that we'll see that shift over time. And then one last comment I'll make about our global business, and particular, our U.S. business, is that we have -- just as we have the past couple of years in 2012, we're moving the needle upwards again on our marketing spend in support of the business. We've had great results as we have in a very disciplined careful way, spent a bit more on engaging consumer to our marketing spend than we have in years past. Some of that's driven in our retail channels and some of that, driven in our CPG business. That marketing spend is paying off quite nicely for us but that is a bit of an uptick on the P&L this year compared to previous years, and it will be most pronounced in Q2, particularly relevant to the launch of Blonde Roast in this quarter.", "Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Great. And just the CPG, so it was, it was all commodities as opposed to say, mix shift towards K-Cups or something like that?", "Troy Alstead", "Almost entirely driven by commodities.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I actually had related questions, probably for Jeff, just on CPG and the related K-Cup. Just first, specific to the K-Cup, I know you talked about 100 million packs shipped in the first quarter. Just wondering if you can size up how that compared to your internal expectation? I know that's only 2 months through the quarter but I'm just trying to figure out how you assess the momentum in that business, whether it's people filling the shelves and therefore, that raise is not sustainable or whether in fact, it is because post holidays, things pick up. I'm just trying to think about how you do some internal planning in terms of your thought process for the K-Cup ramp through the rest of this year. And more broadly speaking, as you now embark on kind of this bigger CPG push, I'm just wondering whether you had any insights for us or learnings on the new segment's aggressive growth whether there's anything that gives you pause or have you really exceeded all of your expectations in terms of building the second platform that's literally going to rival the entire retail business?", "Howard D. Schultz", "With regard to K-Cup, it's still early days, but as we've shipped over 100 million cups in the first 2 months, we're running ahead of our initial expectations on what we expected for the business. And based on everything we can see at this point, it is not just pipeline. It's very hard though at this point for us, to really have an understanding of how high is high, given that we are supply-constrained. So we are seeing takeout at the shelves, we have delivered, as I mentioned my remarks, an 11 share in essentially an 8-week period of even being available, and that's with -- call it 66% ACV distribution in the food drive mass space during the month of December. So we haven't fully reached distribution yet. We haven't really started merchandising yet because we are supply constrained. And at the same time, we are seeing strong sell-through, and again, we don't know what the full upside is yet, because we don't have enough supply. Now importantly, we are working closely with Green Mountain to ensure that we get as many cups as we possibly can. They have been a great partner in meeting their initial expectations on the volume they committed to supply. Again, we're working closely with them to get additional cups to try to fully meet the need in this premium single-cup space. But we are very encouraged, and in fact, the pull on K-Cups is greater than what we had initially expected.", "Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And in terms of the broader, just ramp up, is there anything that gives you pause? I mean, it's tremendous growth you saw. I know, I guess half of that 70% growth is, I'm assuming that's coming from craft and therefore, that disappeared this quarter, if you could just confirm that, and then if there's anything that gives you pause in terms of this very aggressive ramp that we're seeing?", "Howard D. Schultz", "Right, we are seeing some revenue growth associated with bringing, taking the business in-house to the direct model. So that is accurate. We -- there is nothing that gives me pause as to the growth prospects of the CPG business. In fact, as I noted in my comments, we're just getting started. So every day, we're getting stronger as the team that we have assembled from some of the best CPG companies in the industry, learns how to work together more effectively, as we get our syndicated data sources in place, as we get our shopper [ph] marketing resources in place with our key customers, as we learn everyday how to more effectively connect the unique strategic assets of Starbucks to communicate with our customers in unique and different ways to build awareness, consideration, trial and ultimately, loyalty to the brand. So if anything, I am more optimistic about this future that we can build as we learn and get smarter every day. So we're just getting started.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask about China. First off, China ticket was up 5%. Does that represent a price increase to offset inflationary pressures? Or is there some sort of a change in the way consumers are interacting with the brand in China? And then also in China, the acceleration in unit growth which you're now actually starting to see, curious if you're bumping into any internal or external bottlenecks, and what you're finding you have to tweak as you accelerate the trajectory there?", "Howard D. Schultz", "This is Howard and we've got John Culver here, the President of that region. So John?", "John Culver", "Yes, I would say that -- I mean, what we're seeing in China is on the ticket side, there's no impact from pricing. So we have not taken pricing in China. So what you're seeing is real. The comp growth is mainly being driven by transaction. We continue to accelerate the new store growth across all the markets. We now sit in 41 cities across the country. We opened our 500th store this quarter, and this past quarter, we opened 5 new cities, all right. So what we see is continued acceptance of the Starbucks brand and the Starbucks Experience. And in terms of any kind of bottlenecks or barriers, clearly, we are ramping up the investment around the infrastructure, and back-in-the-house systems. So IT systems, as well as supply chain systems and distribution capabilities, and then also, continuing to accelerate the advancement around hiring ahead of the curve, particularly around store operations, as well as with the store development teams. To help drive the growth, we're also accelerating the ability to design stores in market. So we've made significant investment from a store development standpoint of shifting the resources back here in Seattle, and pushing that out into China, into markets of the world much closer and much quicker in the market. And then we've also added additional investment in China around research and development to really capture the consumer trends in China, and to drive innovation that really is going to be impactful for the Chinese consumer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia of William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Troy, a question for you on the full year revenue guidance, kind of keeping it at 10%. I guess you look at every division, and every division's been solid double-digit revenue gains. So implicit in your guidance is that revenue growth will decelerate to the single digits at some point this year. Is there a particular division you're looking at or something we should be aware of on the outside, which would be happening as the year progresses or bring us down to that 10%?", "Troy Alstead", "No, there's actually not. We've been fairly pleased with the revenue growth in the first quarter, it has outpaced our own expectations. But it's still early in the year, and with 3/4 of the year yet ahead of us, just too early to meaningfully update much of that guidance. We have every bit of optimism about our ability to continue to drive the growth in of the business. The only comment I would make is that I recognize, as we all need to, that the algebra at some point, will suggest that those percentages get harder to keep growing, despite the fact that we have every expectations to drive dollars of revenue to all of our channels. So we're very optimistic. Nothing has changed in our view of the future whatsoever. And as we progress through this year, we'll continue to watch our progress in the top line and update targets accordingly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nicole Miller Reagan of Piper Jaffray.", "Joshua C. Long - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "This is Josh on for Nicole. I had 2 quick questions, one to the extent that you can share some details around the expanded test of your evening day part program, that would be great. Any sort of learning to date, or things where we might or opportunities we might see some of those tests or learnings show up in the breakfast or lunch day parts in throughout the rest of the system? And then, maybe one for Jeff as well. Anything longer term that prevents you from kind of expanding this Seattle's Best brand into the K-Cup platform as well. Obviously, it's still early in your relationship with Green Mountain and the K-Cups, but anything that would prevent that from happening over the longer term?", "Clifford Burrows", "Josh, it's Cliff. Let me comment on the evening day part. We are -- as I'm sure you've read, we are extending our tests on beer and wine, supplemented by a small range of appropriate foods to the evening. Today, we have 6 stores serving beer and wine in what we probably call the Pacific Northwest, and we are very encouraged by the customer's one, acceptance; and two, use of the stores over our longer day part. And that's been very encouraging. That's the first part of the test. We will now expand that test to 3 areas: California, Atlanta and Chicago, where approximately, 5 stores in each. And then, it's not going to happen immediately because we have to apply for licenses. But that really will form a meaningful part of the test, because each of those stores is selected based on our learnings. And I think over the coming quarters, we'll be in a better position to say how material is that. And the great news is, customers have accepted it, and they're using the longer day part, not just for beer and wine but for food and using it for occasions where some people have coffee, some tea and someone may have a beer or wine. The good news is, we're on their radar now for that evening day part which I think, in many areas, we were not. So pleased with the initial tests, and we will keep in the U.S., working on the different day parts. And we've seen great success, as I said earlier, with our world platform which is predominantly breakfast. We continue with Bistro Boxes and we'll have further developments there in the future months around the lunch period, and then with the K-Cups, that sort of afternoon day part. So really, challenging ourselves in the U.S. on all day parts, and those learnings are shared with each of my colleagues who run the other regions. But we really are focused on food. It is relevant to our customers in each of the local markets. Jeff?", "Jeffery J. Hansberry", "With regard to Seattle's Best and K-Cups, again, as I mentioned earlier, we're just getting started. And our near-end focus is going to be optimizing our Starbucks brand on that platform. In March of this year, we will launch into CPG in Canada, and later this year, we'll launch in Starbucks retail stores, both in Canada and the U.S. as well. So near end, we're going to be focused against driving Starbucks first.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Keith Siegner of Credit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So I apologize in advance, Troy, I'm going to ask a similar question to the one I asked 2 weeks ago. But looking at G&A as a massive category, particularly, on unallocated. On that call 2 weeks ago, you went through kind of what the pieces were that moved around this part of the restatements, but it's still a really big number. And what I'm trying to get a sense of here is we just saw a pretty nice leverage of G&A in the first quarter. If you could talk through kind of like what the pieces are and then like how maybe the business good leverage G&A over time, should that be coming? Now how should we think about modeling this nearly $600 million expense over the next couple of years as all these businesses grow into the infrastructure you've put in place ahead of that growth?", "Troy Alstead", "Yes, that was the same question you asked 2 weeks ago. G&A, we firmly believe over the long term, is a leverage opportunity for us. Now that won't necessarily be true quarter-to-quarter. In any one particular quarter, there may be investments that are more meaningful or incentive compensation that spikes up or down in a particular quarter. We have, as we've talked with you about before, a hedging program rounded for comp that will spike G&A in any one particular quarter. So quarter-to-quarter moments can be deceiving, but no question over time, we fully expect to be able to leverage that. Now the infrastructure in our support center in Seattle, all the back office functions that live here, as well as our G&A functions that live entirely around the world, are all part of that G&A function overall. We also have operating expenses and G&A that sits in the business units as well. But in terms of the big G&A, the big picture with the large infrastructure we have, both here but now growing around the world, to some extent, we are ahead of the curve on some of our G&A to support growth outside of the U.S., and G&A in this building to support growth in our channel development organization, the CPG business and our global business. That G&A spend we believe, gives us an opportunity to accelerate growth as we have been to drive innovation, and position the growth platforms we have for the future, and then also, to become a leverage point down the road. So I believe you should expect, over the long term, moderate leverage to come, year in and year out, for some period of time now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "My question had to do with the launch of the Blonde Roast. You mentioned that it was incremental to the category. I took that maybe to mean it was more incremental to the category of the CPG channel. But can you talk about how you think about that? Is it incremental to the retail business as well? What are your early reads? Is it actually seeing, producing the sales lift and are new customers coming into the stores, or are you just sort of trading an existing customer to a lighter roast who may prefer that in the afternoon, for example? So can you talk about how you think that performs in the 2 different channels? And can you also just, maybe Jeff, can you add to how that's going to fold into the CPG this year? How soon can you get, forgive me if you already mentioned this, but how soon can you get that full distribution on that lighter roast?", "Howard D. Schultz", "This is Howard, John. The comment that we made in our prepared remarks regarding Blonde, in terms of incrementality was all channels. The research we've done and the early read, and I want to underscore it is early, leads us to believe that there are millions of customers who have not really chosen Starbucks as their primary place for either the beverage or holding [ph] coffee. And we believe, based on the research we've done, and as I said the early read, that we're going to see incrementality on both fronts. But also, I want to make an overarching comment about just we have witnessed, as well as other consumer brand companies, a seismic change in consumer behavior, going back to the height of the cataclysmic recession in 2008, 2009. And I just want to just dive into that very briefly, so you understand the attributes and the differentiation that we have as a company to go after that. And I would list 3 major areas in terms of the seismic change: One is that as a result of the recession, there is a significant amount of pressure on the consumer, whether they're buying luxury or mass in terms of value. The second is, as a result of the technology and the web, social digital media has become a primary vehicle to gain access information. And I will revisit that in a minute. And the third is the unbelievable way, in which mobile payment and mobile commerce is going to change the way in which consumers buy things. On the issue of value, the question was asked earlier about transactions and ticket. One of the differentiating factors of the last year or so has been the loyalty and the stickiness of the Starbucks Card. There's almost 4 million people holding that card. 1 of every 4 people are buying with the card. And what we've been able to do is, which is very difficult, is balance the premium position and premium pricing of Starbucks, while creating value, in a sense, putting our feet in the shoes of our customers and giving value, that's A. B, with regard to social and digital media, there probably isn't very many companies in America that has created the capability and the discipline that we have with almost 40 million worldwide fans on Facebook, leading company in Twitter on Foursquare, what that has done, has given us the ability to lower our cost of customer acquisition in terms of traditional advertising, and build a more enduring emotional relationship with our customers. The third issue is that Starbucks today, and this is an important point, we are the #1 company not in the U.S. but in the world in terms of mobile payment, transactions and dollars. Now all of this is wrapped into the relevancy of the Starbucks brand and the experience, and this is what is driving much of the incrementality that we are experiencing. These 3 things wrapped into what Cliff and his team have been able to do in the U.S. is build a customer experience. And to think that today, we are serving more customers than ever before in our history, despite the economic downturn, and this year's stores that opened 12 months ago, are performing at the highest level of any other time in our history. So I think it's very important that you understand that the macro issues that are facing many companies, we have been able to turn into a competitive advantage with regard to value, social digital media and mobile payment.", "John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And just the rollout of the Blonde then in the grocery channel, is that fully distributed at this point or...", "Clifford Burrows", "Yes, John. First, it is a big deal for us in CPG, given that 70% of all premium coffee sales are in the light or medium roast segment, 54 million customers prefer a lighter roast. And when you take Blonde and you match it up with this brand-new roast architecture packaging that is rolling out right now, those 2 pieces combined will make it easier than ever to shop the Starbucks aisle for our customers, and we offer this lighter roast in Blonde Roast which is a big deal. We have timed the launch to be synchronized with our key customers, shelf resets happening during Q1, and you will see Blonde Roast in a number of stores. We will be fully rolled out with the new pack architecture and with Blonde Roast coffees by the middle of this quarter. And also very importantly, all of our key Tier 1 and Tier 2 grocery and mass customers have accepted Blonde and are in the process of cutting it in now.", "Operator", "And you have a question from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a really quick follow up and some prepared remarks. Troy, do you have the unredeemed gift card balance for the end of the quarter in front of you?", "Troy Alstead", "No, that's something we'll finalize and disclose when we produce the 10-Q ass usual, John. And that'll -- you'll see those balances at that point in time. And I think you'll notice the deferred revenue line, but I will point out, we saw rapid growth in all use of the Starbucks Card, of reload, of use, and that was true of transactions within the quarter, but importantly, the deferred revenue for future quarters was very significant in the first quarter.", "Howard D. Schultz", "And over 20% growth over last year.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And secondly, if I may and completely unrelated, there is a fairly big deal made around the redesign of the Starbucks logo last year. I mean really focusing on the iconography of the green mermaid. And there was at least interpretations I had that we might begin to see that logo on non-coffee products such as, for example, Evolution juice. And I guess what I'm asking is, as you think about the broader CPG portfolio is, will you start to use that type of iconography on brands like Evolution or other brands that you might develop or acquire that won't necessarily be coffee, but we know what kind of an honor [ph] the same type of principles that Starbucks as a company has?", "Howard D. Schultz", "Well, the logo change clearly, was designed to give us the freedom and the flexibility to take advantage of the blueprint for growth with other CPG products and categories. I think we're going to be very thoughtful and very disciplined, when and how we use the new graphics on products or categories that, on their own merit, will make that decision. And when we redesign the graphic and brand architecture of Evolution, which will be in the middle of the year, you'll see us unveil how we're going to use that or whether or not we're going to use it. But clearly, the new logo gives us the flexibility to operate within the other categories and other products, and we'll leverage the blueprint for growth by bringing those products into our stores, primarily first.", "Operator", "And you have a question from the line of Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just had 2 questions on things, just to try to clarify a bit. The ticket increase in the U.S., can you talk about the breakdown of that between price, and maybe the food contribution? And there's been reports of price increases here in New York and other places. How should we think about price in the U.S. going forward.", "Clifford Burrows", "Joe, this is Cliff. We have continued the same strategy on pricing now over the last 3 years, and developing our, I would say, expertise and focus around individual products, the whole portfolio of products, but unique to that local market. Overall, price is approximately 1% over the course of the year, but you will find that, that is not all prices up by 1%. We're very conscious of the value, as I've said for the customer, and we're also conscious of just the price architecture. So we've been very focused on items, on food. Obviously, we take every opportunity to focus on new product, improved ingredients, improved quality, at the same time, we're very conscious of the pressure on prices and commodities in the market place. So yes, we continue to review it periodically, and we are very conscious of keeping that to a modest level to support our customers. And obviously, on those frequent visitors, have the My Starbucks Rewards programs to support the use of the Starbucks Card and the price they pay on certain items will be discounted because one of the benefits of the card, or they get free beverage every 15, all of which helps them keep their average ticket down.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one my clarification question. Jeff, you talked about the CPG revenue growth being driven, I think, you said driven equally by takeups and the craft business. Could you talk, just elaborate a little bit further on that, and maybe throw VIA into that discussion as well?", "Jeffery J. Hansberry", "Yes, Joe. So that is in rough terms, probably roughly equal parts from single-cup growth and from bringing the roast and ground business to a direct model. In terms of VIA, I'm glad you asked, I think for VIA to be overshadowed by all the other great news in the CPG space. We continue to do extremely well on the VIA business. And when you look at VIA and K-Cup together, we have now captured nearly a -- we're up to, in the most recent month, a 17% of the premium single-cup space between those 2 big and important brands and again, just getting started. So for VIA, we launched House Blend and Breakfast Blend in the quarter, and we're building distribution on those varietals. We've got more good news coming on VIA. In the quarter, we grew on a syndicated databases by 42% on the VIA business. And what is also very encouraging on VIA, I've reported to you in the past about our repeat rates running in the high 30s. Most recent tracking against repeat rates, they're actually now approaching 40. So we're getting people to try VIA, and when they try it, the repeat rates are at the higher end of the category. Again in the first quarter, we ran the VIA products for the second time, which gives customers an opportunity to try VIA, and if they don't like it, we'll replace the coffee. That has continued to prove itself to be a great vehicle for getting -- garnering trial for the brand. So we're very encouraged and see a lot of opportunity for VIA going forward, both in the U.S. and abroad.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco of Lazard.", "Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple of clarifications there. On that last response there, when you mentioned premium cup market share. I guess it was 11% with the K-Cups. It was 17% when you lump in VIA with that, if that's correct. Can you just put that in context with, I guess we've, mostly, we think of sort of the $2 billion K-Cup single-serve category, how do you -- do you have market share data on that? And then, Troy, earlier in the call, I think the first couple of questions, were on the leverage in the stores. When I looked at the store operating expense line, it grew 10% sort of in line with -- in the Americas this is -- the America revenues from the company-owned stores. I guess it was lagging about half the pace of growth in the prior couple of quarters. I'm curious, is that the beginning where we're going to start marketing show up? And is that pretty much limited to the first half for the year and starting to get back to lagging top line trends if we were to sustain these type of comps?", "Howard D. Schultz", "With regard to the market shares that I'm speaking to, I'm speaking from IRI syndicated data for the food drug mass business. That does not provide the full picture of K-Cup. But the premium single-cup segment that I'm speaking to, is a combination of all premium single-cup packs, priced at or above $0.50 per serving. And that's exactly right, we are at a near 17 share for the month of December, and are trending upward quickly. And again and importantly, we see both the K-Cup business, the Starbucks K-Cup business, as well as the Starbucks VIA business, as both being billion-dollar opportunities for Starbucks.", "Troy Alstead", "And to your -- Matt, your margin question, for the full year, so not just Q2, it's just more pronounced in Q2, but for the full year, we are moving the needle upwards modestly on marketing spend, and that's a very conscious move, a very strategic move in something that paid off for us quite meaningfully, we believe in driving incremental traffic in the last year, in the last 2 as we've moved the needle, some of [ph] the marketing and we plan to do it again this year. It will be more pronounced in the second quarter, particularly the launch of Blonde Roast, but it is true throughout the year, that we'll have some incremental spend on marketing, and that shows up in store operating expense, when it's applied against our store business. But the overarching point I'd make here is that our whole intention here is to, over time, provide the right leverage points on the overall Americas P&L. It's a high-margin business already, last year, about 20% operating margin. We've targeted improvement in that margin in the Americas as we have in each of our regions, as we go throughout the course of this year. So we would expect that margin to improve. And some of that over time will be fixed expenses, store operating expenses will have some leverage points, but those also incremental investments that we do make from quarter-to-quarter in, as I said marketing, and other elements of that line.", "Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Certainly, the comp and the traffic that you're getting, shows that there's a massive response to the marketing side. I was curious as far as if you were to look at the comp growth that you've had the last couple of years, I'm assuming you're surpassing average store level volumes prerecession and pre-closing down the stores. So can you talk about -- I mean I guess with all of the new products coming down the pipe, with K-Cup soon to come into your stores, with the Blonde starting to get more momentum behind it, food, healthier items, all of it, looking at the upper decile of your stores and capacity, can you sort of put us to rest to not be concerned about capacity constraints? Can you -- What are you seeing as far as improvements that your upper decile, as far as store volumes versus historical levels? And I guess you've focused a lot in the beginning about efficiency. Is that where we're starting to talk about that more and look at throughput, and being able to handle those capacity issues?", "Howard D. Schultz", "Well, let me start, this is Howard and Cliff can finish. I think what we have uncovered over the last 18 months or so, is that we've really kind of dialed into the need phase [ph] that customers have during different day parts of the day. And that's where you see the new products that we've introduced. And also, I think the marketing has been much more focused on being able to capture customers at different parts of the day, where that is a new discipline within Starbucks that we did not have a few years ago. And I think what that has resulted in, is that we think there's lots of runway, lots of whitespace throughout the day, and I think there's opportunities that we still have not uncovered that goes past the evening hour, whether it's the test that we have now with beer and wine, or other things that we're thinking about that take advantage of the fixed cost of our real estate. But no one at Starbucks is looking at any kind of ceiling. We believe that we're just getting started and we're not going to use historical information or data to put a lid on what we think is possible. And I think the fact is that we're doing more volume and serving more customers than any other time in the 40 year history of the company, and we're just getting started.", "Clifford Burrows", "I think it's really true, Howard. Just to add to that. We've really been focused and we continue to focus on our effectiveness and efficiency. And what I mean by that, is simplifying the work, investing in growing the skills of our baristas, supplementing that with technology. And the performance of our stores at the top end, have just got stronger this year, and we still believe there is more capacity even at peak. Add to that work we're doing around technology in the card, again, it will help us drive, Troy mentioned earlier, we've now seen some testing which gives me real confidence that we can show significant improvement. If you look at the day parts to Howard's point, we have virtually no share of lunch, and that is a huge opportunity for us. We've started -- we have a commitment to that, and that ray [ph] will be a big opportunity. So we do see volumes growing. We do see as being more efficiency to peak and capitalizing on other opportunities in day parts.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you all for the great questions this afternoon. This concludes our First Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Appreciate you joining us today, and we'll talk to you again soon.

My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Starbucks Coffee Company's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Joining me on the call today is Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; and Troy Alstead, CFO.", "Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.", "Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to the financial statements accompanying the earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. ", "This conference call is being webcast, and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website at www.starbucks.com under Investor Relations. ", "With that, let me turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?", "Howard D. Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today's call. I'm very pleased to report the record second quarter fiscal 2012 results that Starbucks announced today. As we sit here today, Starbucks has 17,420 stores in 58 countries, serving nearly 60 million customers each week.", "Our record Q2 revenues and earnings were driven by strong overall global comparable store sales growth, a significant increase in our CPG, what we refer to as Channel Development segment revenues and operational excellence. A strong top line combined with increased efficiencies and continued discipline around controlling costs enabled us to deliver second quarter EPS of $0.40 to our shareholders. ", "I'm particularly pleased that we were able to accomplish these results despite the challenges posed by high-legacy commodity costs and a particularly difficult consumer environment in Western Europe, further highlighted by the recessionary news out of England just this morning. ", "I would not ordinarily begin a call with discussion of one particular market, but we had such a memorable trip to China last week that I wanted to share a few of the details with you upfront. Starbucks' business in China is strong and poised for significant disciplined profitable growth. We have seen a tremendous increase in momentum in China since my last trip, as more and more Chinese consumers frequent our stores and connect with the Starbucks brand and store experience.", "You almost have to see the customer engagement for yourself to fully appreciate the transformation. In the past, our typical core customer in China was an expat or tourist visiting a store in Shanghai or Beijing. Today, without question, we have made the significant transition to serving local Chinese customers who enjoy a wide variety of locally relevant products and a welcoming third place environment.", "We are well on our way to achieving our plan of having 1,500 stores in Mainland China by 2015. In fact, we are so encouraged by the customer adoption we are experiencing and the momentum that has been growing that we announced today that we are increasing our China/Asia Pacific store opening targets for the fiscal year to 400 from 300, with China stores representing half of that growth.", "Our comps in China continue to grow at a double-digit rate, reminiscent of our U.S. growth in the early 1990s, and store profit contribution is among the highest we have ever had in the company's history. Our progress and level of customer loyalty in Tier 1 cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen is now being mirrored in the 44 other cities that have embraced us as well. And our China leadership team, led by John Culver and Belinda Wong on the ground in China, are doing a terrific job building the foundational elements of our brand imprinting our partners with our values and delivering a fantastic customer experience in our store.", "The team has also engaged in ongoing forums with multiple stakeholders so that we are building our business with great sensitivity and respect for the Chinese culture. While I was in Beijing last week, we brought together for the first time a group of the leading real estate executives from all over the country in order to share our values and long-term growth plans for the China market. The event was an overwhelming success that brought us closer to Chinese developers and landlords and will help us better compete for choice locations as we expand our operations.", "Perhaps at no time during the trip was our enthusiasm and optimism greater than as the 2 first-of-their-kind partner family forums we held in Beijing and Shanghai. Following a theme of growing together, the forums provided us with an opportunity to connect with 1,200 of our partners, their parents and other family members. Through these events, we were able to demonstrate our recognition and appreciation of the importance of family in Chinese culture, to share our own tradition and values and to communicate our commitment to investing in and developing our partners so that they and we succeed together. We made it evident to Chinese parents that Starbucks can give their children career opportunities and important life skills that will prepare them for the future. Our Chinese partners are passionate to grow with us, and they are eager for opportunities to share more of the Starbucks Experience with their customers every day.", "As a result of this trip and in response to the growing strength and relevancy of the Starbucks brand, our team has also made the decision to bring at home single-serve espresso and brewed coffee to the rapidly growing Chinese middle and upper middle classes. We'll do this by introducing Verismo by Starbucks a single-serve espresso beverage and brewed coffee machine, and Starbucks-sourced 100% arabica coffee and milk pods to the Chinese market sometime in calendar 2013, much earlier than initially contemplated.", "We believe that we have a strong competitive advantage and that we can use our stores as the distribution system to build trial and awareness that will help create excitement and adoption of Verismo in China. Our success in China is built on the solid foundation and the dynamic efficient organization that evolved from the work we did in connection with our U.S. transformation. As John and his team are executing in China, we are also taking this fully integrated proven playbook into markets around the world.", "I would now like to speak to changes in the macro consumer behavior and consumer confidence issues facing most consumer brands and retailers around the world. There is no doubt that the seismic change in consumer behavior that has occurred over the last several years and coincided with the economic crisis that moved around the globe is in many ways here to stay. Now more than ever before, businesses and particularly consumer brands, must innovate and create differentiated value propositions for their customers in order to succeed.", "Starbucks identified the shift very early, and we responded with My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program to both create value for our customers and build loyalty to our brand, and it has been widely successful. Today, there are more than 4.7 million active members in our loyalty program in the U.S. alone and over 2 million members in our loyalty program internationally loading more than $2.5 billion on cards annually. We have introduced the card in multiple markets around the world and have plans now to add even more in the months and quarters ahead as we build and share our value proposition around the world.", "We are also at the forefront of mobile payment convenience and capability, where our mobile app has generated more than 45 million mobile payment transactions over the last 14 months, making Starbucks the largest and most widely embraced mobile payment program of any retailer in North America. The successful integration of our card and loyalty programs with our mobile apps has exponentially increased the relevancy and attachment of all 3 platforms, giving us an ongoing competitive advantage.", "Starbucks is also an early mover in recognizing the disruptive opportunity for social and digital platforms. We are among the most liked brands on Facebook, most checked-in retailers on Foursquare, tweeted-about brand on Twitter and followed brand on the explosive Instagram platform. But those accolades mean less -- may mean little unless they drive a higher level of trust and a deeper emotional connection between the brand and the consumer in order to drive incremental revenue and create value for shareholders Starbucks' social and digital media capabilities do just that by enabling us to connect more deeply and more often with our customers and to compete more effectively by dramatically driving a higher return on our overall marketing investment all around the world.", "Just yesterday, I was a featured keynote speaker at Facebook's Annual Global Leadership Meeting where I spoke to over 1,000 Facebook leaders and where Starbucks was highlighted as one of the leading innovators in the world on the Facebook platform.", "Let me now shift my comments to a number of initiatives, developments and investments we have undertaken that have contributed to our achievement of our record financial performance and the highest level of customer relevancy as measured by any metric in our history. Then I will share a few exciting examples of how we are bringing our Blueprint for Profitable Growth to life and turn the call over to Troy.", "In Q2, we announced several significant initiatives that further solidifies Starbucks' authority and leadership position in both packaged coffee and the exciting fast-growing at-home single cup and espresso specialty coffee categories. In January, to complement our full line of medium and dark roast coffees, we introduced Blonde, a lighter roast coffee available both packaged and in VIA and in K-Cup portion packs in response to strong demand from the 50 million-plus consumers who prefer a lighter coffee roast.", "Early results suggest that our Blonde Roast coffees have been very well received, and that we are seeing incrementality in sales of brewed coffee, whole bean and VIA since launching in our stores. In March, we announced the Verismo system by Starbucks, a premium single-cup category innovation. Verismo enables consumers to craft both Starbucks' quality espresso beverages and brewed coffee consistently and conveniently one cup at a time from a single machine.", "Through an exclusive strategic relationship with Germany-based Krueger, we will begin marketing and selling the Starbucks Verismo system and Starbucks-sourced 100% arabica coffee and milk pods this fall in our stores and in specialty retail stores as well. And also in March, we announced the expansion of our strategic relationship with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters to include the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sales of Starbucks-branded Vue packs for use in Green Mountain's recently introduced Krueger -- I'm sorry, Keurig Vue Brewer.", "At Starbucks, coffee remains at the center of everything we do. Starbucks Blonde Roast, together with Starbucks VIA, Starbucks K-Cup portion packs, Vue and now Starbucks Verismo demonstrates our commitment to absolutely lead the premium coffee category globally. From espresso to specialty roast and ground coffee to the rapidly emerging $8 billion premium single-serve market, our commitment is to deliver Starbucks quality coffee to our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to enjoy them.", "In March, we also announced plans for a global launch of a new beverage platform, Starbucks Refreshers, making Starbucks the first to bring natural energy from green coffee extract to consumers on a global scale. Refreshers will be viewed globally as the handcrafted beverage in our stores later this summer, and ready-to-drink Refreshers is currently available in 50,000 outlets and will grow to over 100,000 outlets in the U.S. alone, literally creating millions of additional impressions for the Starbucks brand, further enhancing our Blueprint for Growth.", "Our commitment to innovation is impacting in a very meaningful way how we approach both our new store openings as well as store remodels. In Q2, we opened 50 net new company-operated stores around the world built to achieve LEED certification standards and with a commitment to local relevance in the local community. And we are on plan to open 1,000 net new stores globally and to remodel approximately 1,700 company-operated stores in the U.S. by the end of the year. Our shareholders are already realizing very favorable incremental returns on the investments in the remodels and new stores.", "A few words on how the decisions we make are being informed by our Blueprint for Profitable Growth business strategy. Last year, we acquired Evolution Fresh, a fantastic company and brand with great people that is providing us with an exciting opportunity to revolutionize the $3.4 billion premium cold frappe to juice category. Last month, we introduced consumers to a unique premium juice and healthy food experience with the opening of our first Evolution Fresh retail store in Bellevue, Washington. Customer response to the store has been very positive, and we are incorporating the early learnings from the first store into plans for future retail expansion.", "But there is much more to the Evolution health story. Drawing upon and leveraging Starbucks' unique merchandising and marketing expertise, we have transformed the look and feel of the Evolution Fresh packaging to more fully and effectively communicate the pure wholesome ingredients found in each nutritious and delicious Evolution Fresh juice. Consumers have embraced the new packaging, and consistent with the Blueprint, have already begun making Evolution Fresh bottle juices available in grocery stores in the West Coast and in our Seattle area of Starbucks retail stores. Customer response to the introduction of Evolution Fresh juices in each of these channels has been quite strong. In Starbucks retail stores alone, early results are pointing to a doubling of units sold as compared to the products Evolution Fresh juices are replacing.", "We will be employing all facets of the Blueprint to make Evolution Fresh the success we know it will be. Our U.S. retail store footprint, our social and digital media expertise, our Starbucks loyalty card program, our growing Channel Development muscle, and our more than 100,000 U.S. store partners to promote trial and awareness of Evolution Fresh juices in our stores. We plan to have Evolution Fresh beverages available across the Starbucks U.S. retail store system this summer and to leverage our new CPG distribution capabilities and roll out Evolution Fresh into multiple CPG channels over the next 18 months. We are extremely encouraged by the channel partner and customer response to the Evolution Fresh brand and platform and are more convinced than ever that Evolution Fresh will become another billion-dollar Starbucks brand.", "Today, innovation and a laser focus on leveraging our social and digital media capabilities and delivering best-in-class products and a materially enhanced customer experience is part of Starbucks' DNA at every level of the organization and around the world. We are connecting more deeply and interacting more often with more customers than ever before in our history. ", "Starbucks business and the Starbucks brand have never been stronger, and we are both uniquely and ideally positioned to go after the enormous opportunity that lies ahead as we execute against our Blueprint for Profitable Growth in a disciplined and deliberate fashion all around the world.", "On a personal level, I cannot be more excited, enthusiastic or optimistic about our future, and I thank the over 200,000 Starbucks partners who bring the Starbucks Experience to life every day.", "I'll now turn the call over to Troy.", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. You can see based on Howard's remarks why we are so optimistic about what the future holds for Starbucks, and why we have communicated such aspirational growth targets for this year and beyond.", "But before I move to that, I'd like to take you through our fiscal second quarter results. Today, we reported second quarter records for revenues, operating income and earnings per share. We continue to drive strong incremental traffic despite lapping significant comp growth from the past 2 years, and we continue to offset uncontrollable headwinds, particularly the struggling global economy and high coffee costs with operational efficiencies and innovation.", "Our second quarter consolidated net revenues were $3.2 billion, up 15% from $2.8 billion a year ago. Revenue increase was primarily driven by a 7% increase in global comparable store sales, attributable to a 6% increase in traffic and a 1% increase in average ticket. Higher channel development revenues and solid gains in our licensed stores also contributed to the global revenue increase.", "Operating income for the second quarter reached $430 million, a 14% increase over last year's second quarter. Consolidated operating margin was 13.5%, which was equal to the second quarter of last year. Higher commodity costs, primarily coffee, had a negative impact on operating income of $64 million and added 200 basis points of pressure on operating margin. Primarily offsetting this was increased sales leverage throughout much of the P&L, driven by our strong top line results.", "Our consolidated G&A spend for the second quarter was 6.5% of net revenue, flat for the second quarter of last year. 3/4 of our total $207 million expense in G&A in Q2 are presented in our financial statements in other, and as a percentage of total net revenues, declined slightly over the second quarter of last year. This was largely made up of support expenses such as IT, marketing, finance, partner resources and other global functions.", "This quarter also included investment to launch our Evolution Fresh brand. The remaining 1/4 of our G&A expenses lie within each business segment, and our expense is directly related to the support of those businesses. Our total business unit G&A as a percentage of total net revenue increased slightly over last Q2, due largely to growth in our Channel Development segment as we ramp up support of this high-growth business.", "Earnings per share grew 18% to $0.40 for the second quarter, which included approximately $0.02 from the income benefit of a court ruling related to recognition of unredeemed stored value cards. You will see this reflected in the Interest Income and Other line. Finally, we continue to generate strong cash flow to fund capital expenditures and growth initiatives while returning capital to shareholders.", "Let me now discuss our Americas business, which continued its excellent performance in the second quarter. Net revenues of $2.4 billion were 10% higher than the second quarter of last year, driven by strong comps of 8%. Comp transactions grew 7%, which despite still cautious consumer spending, was positively impacted by continued operational excellence in our stores, accelerating the benefit of the My Starbucks Rewards program, further success with our warming program and incremental visits due to the launch of Blonde Roast coffee.", "Speaking of Blonde Roast, one of the highlights in the Americas in the second quarter was its launch on January 10 in the U.S. and on February 7 in Canada. Blonde Roast has been well received by both partners and customers. As we expected, we are seeing new customer occasions from our brewed coffee drinkers as they now have an offering to satisfy their desire for something lighter in addition to their usual visits. And whole bean sales in our stores have also increased, with 70% of Blonde Roast whole bean in-store purchases being incremental to previous purchasing patterns. It is still very early, but all these signs are encouraging for the future contribution of this great new offering.", "Operating income also grew by 10% in the quarter, and we saw a slight improvement in operating margin despite the negative 150 basis point impact of higher commodity costs, mostly coffee. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenue were up slightly year-over-year. This is due to increased marketing expenses in support of the Blonde Roast launch and increased bank fees related to debit card transactions stemming from recent legislation.", "We have talked a great deal about our success in driving efficiency in our stores and the resulting improvements to our margins. Our store operating expenses in the Americas has improved 380 basis points from 2009 to the first half of this year. We continue to relentlessly pursue opportunities for further efficiencies. We're also actively analyzing opportunities to invest in operating expenses such our labor and marketing spend to further drive the top and bottom lines.", "Looking forward, the pipeline of new offerings in our stores remains robust. We've already begun adding Evolution Fresh bottled juices in our Seattle area stores, and we'll expand to additional cities throughout the year. In July, we will add Refreshers ready-to-drink and handcrafted beverages, and in the coming months, we will begin selling Starbucks K-Cups in our retail stores to meet our customer's in-home brewing needs.", "Outside the U.S., we're seeing solid comps and margin improvement in Canada as we're leveraging the learnings from the U.S. in the past few years. And in Latin America, the markets continue to perform well with strong comp growth in a long runway for additional stores. In fact, our comp growth in Brazil is outpacing our expectations, which is evidence that our stores and brand continues to be well received.", "In Europe, Middle East and Africa, the second quarter results reflect both the investments we've begun making in the transformation of the region, as well as the macroeconomic headwinds that we and others face there. While net revenues grow 14% year-over-year, the bulk of that was due to the consolidation of the Switzerland and Austrian markets. Same-store sales for our company-operated stores in the region were negative 1% for the quarter, first negative comp growth in this region since 2009.", "And while we comped positively in the U.K. and France, it wasn't enough to offset softness in Germany and Ireland. We are not immune from the high unemployment and fragile consumer confidence across the region, but just as in the U.S. 3 years ago, we're actively working to overcome those challenges.", "In March, our EMEA time launched what we are calling the Renaissance Plan, our blueprint for turning around performance in that important region, which is modeled after the success of our transformation agenda in the U.S. Already, our efforts are resonating with customers. In the second quarter, we saw the largest quarterly gain in our customer satisfaction scores in more than 2 years. We're sharpening our focus on in-store execution, including taking the steps to retrain all partners on preparing the perfect beverage each and every time. We're also adapting our approach to become more locally relevant, including adjusting the U.K. tall latte standard to include 2 shots of espresso, offering a second varietal of espresso to meet French customer needs and personalizing each experience by writing customers' names on cups. ", "Adjustments are being made to the long-term business model, including revamping our distribution model in the U.K. and increasing visibility to our strong digital marketing capabilities. These changes were largely the result of extensive customer research in the region and are a beginning step in the long road of correcting our course there.", "EMEA saw an operating loss of $5.5 million in the second quarter, higher implementation costs as we work through the transition to what will be a much more efficient distribution model in the U.K. contributed to the loss. Additionally, we lost leverage in our store opening expenses in parts of Europe due to softer sales, and our G&A grew to support the new vision for the region.", "The turnaround story in EMEA will be told over many chapters in the coming quarters and years. With our deep capabilities and sharpened disciplined honed over the past few years, we are confident the story will have an ending that is familiar to those who watch the U.S. turnaround unfold.", "Howard spoke to the positive momentum we're experiencing in China and Asia Pacific, and we're seeing that momentum flow through to the P&L. Net revenues in this region increased 32% over the second quarter of last year, driven by a balanced equation of new stores and same-store sales growth. 18% comps in our company-operated markets were comprised of a 14% increase in transactions and 4% increase in average ticket. Combined with the 18% comp growth last Q2, this puts our 2-year comps at 36% and is evidence of how much the brand is gaining consistent traction with consumers across Asia. Including our joint venture and license markets, all 12 countries in the region comped positively, driven by growing brand awareness and acceptance throughout the region, coupled with beverage, food and merchandise offerings linked to cultural events like the Chinese New Year.", "Speaking of China, we once again saw comps exceed 20% in the second quarter. The Starbucks brand is resonating with the Chinese consumer, and we are in the early stages of building a very loyal base. In fact, we celebrated our one-year anniversary of the My Starbucks Rewards program in China in Q2, and we already have more than 0.5 million members across a base of 330 company-operated stores.", "Operating income in Cap [ph] was also strong, increasing 59% to $70 million in the second quarter. Operating margin grew 650 basis points to 39.8% despite higher commodity costs of approximately 140 basis points. This quarter's results also were impacted by the favorable timing of income for certain of our joint venture operations, which we do not expect to occur in the future.", "Our team is continuing to do an excellent job of flowing our growing revenue through to the bottom line despite continued inflationary pressure in key Asian markets like China.", "I'm going to move now to results from our Channel Development business. As a reminder, the name of the segment changed from Consumer Products Group or CPG but still represents the same business. The second fiscal quarter was an active one, as we marked the one-year anniversary of the transition of our packaged coffee business to a direct distribution model, rolled out several new products including Blonde Roast Coffee and Refreshers ready-to-drink beverages and announced even more innovative products that will be available later this year.", "Our IRI-syndicated data revealed strong performance for many of our channels in the second quarter, and the most recent numbers show trends that are improving further. For the 4-week period ended April 15, Starbucks' dollar share of premium coffee continued to increase with packaged coffee sales and food, drug and mass channels, up more than 17% over the prior year. This was aided by Blonde Roast, whose distribution reached more than 50% ACV in less than 3 months and hit 90% ACV in our Tier 1 accounts.", "The strong customer response we've seen in Blonde Roast Coffee, both in the grocery aisle and on retail stores, has given us another proof point that the product innovation and go-to-market strategies we put in place are working as intended.", "In the premium single cup market, Starbucks has rapidly grown from no presence in the segment to a 21% share in just 2.5 years, driven by the continued growth of Starbucks VIA Ready Brew and the recent strong launch of Starbucks K-Cups. VIA sales were up 54% in the most recent 4-week period as we increased both SKU count and distribution. And K-Cups continued to see gains with the 15% share of the premium single cup market and more than 230 million cups shipped since their launch 5 months ago.", "We also recently announced the introduction of our Verismo premium single-cup brewing system, which will be available this fall and will allow users to make both Starbucks quality of special beverages and brewed coffee at home. The addition of the Verismo system to our portfolio and product offerings once again demonstrates our commitment to provide our customers with premium coffee whenever, wherever and however they like it. We're also demonstrating product innovation in our ready-to-drink product line as we are now one month into the launch of Starbucks Refreshers in the CPG channels, a line of naturally flavored drinks made from real fruit juice and green coffee extract.", "The results of our Channel Development business was strong once again, with total net revenues of $322 million in Q2, an increase of 57% over the same period last year. The addition of Starbucks K-Cups accounted for more than half of the increase, with the transition of the packaged coffee business in-house among other drivers of the revenue growth. ", "Channel Development operating income for the quarter was $82 million, a 22% increase over the same quarter last year. Operating margin of 25.4% was as expected, 740 basis points lower than the same quarter last year. Higher commodity costs once again had a significant impact in the second quarter, accounting for 620 basis points of margin deterioration. As we enter the second half of fiscal 2012, we remain solidly on track with our plans for the Channel Development business and are focused on executing against the diverse opportunities for growth we have in our portfolio.", "Now that we're halfway through fiscal 2012, I'd like to provide an updated outlook for the year. Given the strength of the first half of the year, revenue percentage growth over last year is now expected to be in the low teens. Due to the fact that we have now lapped the transition to a direct distribution model for our packaged coffee business, our balance of year trends will be modestly lower than the first half.", "We expect company-operated comparable store sales to grow at a mid-single-digit pace. We continue to expect operating margin to grow by 50 to 100 basis points over our FY '11 non-GAAP results, driven by a second half uptick in margins due to easing commodity cost pressure. We continue to expect the Americas segment to improve slightly over last year's 20%. We now expect EMEA, while remaining profitable for the full year, to decline compared to last year due to the current economic climate in many of our markets there and due to our continued investment to support our turnaround efforts. We're now targeting CAP to end the year with operating margin of approximately 30% to 35%, recognizing the consistently strong results this region continues to deliver. And finally, we're targeting Channel Development operating margin in approximately 25%, down from prior years due largely to higher commodity costs.", "As we have generated considerable momentum in our business, we're raising our expectations for earnings per share growth for the second half of fiscal 2012 to a range of 25% to 29% over last year's second half, excluding non-routine gains. For the third quarter, we're targeting EPS in the range of $0.45 to $0.46; and for the fourth quarter, we're targeting EPS in the range of $0.46 to $0.48. Our full year EPS target range is now $1.81 to $1.84, representing 19% to 21% growth over the $1.52 EPS in FY '11 excluding last year's non-routine gains.", "The expected impact of higher commodity costs in FY '12 remains unchanged from what I previously guided, approximately $230 million. We anticipate an approximately $0.06 unfavorable impact to EPS for the second half of the year. While I will give targets for the next fiscal year, 2013, during our third quarter earnings call, I do want to give you a look at what we're expecting for next year as a result of declining coffee prices. We're now approximately 11 months price-protected for fiscal 2013 at prices favorable to 2012. This should equate to an operating income tailwind somewhat higher than $100 million. It's important to note that we expect to reinvest at least half and perhaps more of this commodity upside back into the business. We're looking to further build infrastructure to accelerate growth in China, we'll continue investment into the transformation of Europe and as we did in New Orleans in October of 2008, we're holding a global leadership conference this October in Houston that is expected to cost between $35 million and $40 million.", "Moving on to store counts. Given the strength of our business and new store performance, we are increasing our new store target to approximately 1,000 net new stores globally. We're accelerating new store growth in the Americas, now expected to add approximately 500 net new stores and also accelerating in CAP, which allowed approximately 400 net new stores. We had no change to our EMEA estimate of 100 net new stores as we're largely focused on the improvement in our existing assets in that region.", "The new store growth and a record number of renovations will drive capital expenditures of approximately $900 million in FY '12. We continue to expect the tax rate of approximately 33% for the year, and marketing is still expected at 3.5% of revenues, with increases in each quarter versus the prior year.", "The second quarter just ended reflects the fundamental health and relevance of the Starbucks brand, the continued strong trends of the Starbucks business and our ability to drive growth in the top and the bottom lines. The quarter underscores our financial discipline, deep capabilities and unwavering commitment to overcome the challenges we face in the business from the economic crisis in the U.S. beginning in 2008 to the unprecedented commodity costs of the past 2 years and now to the macroeconomic turmoil in Europe. ", "The quarter demonstrates our deep commitment to the core coffee category, including introduction of Blonde Roast to provide existing and new customers a new way to experience Starbucks coffee and to provide the company access to a greater share of the overall coffee category. The quarter deepens our leadership in the premium single-cup segment, with a continued strong growth of VIA, the rapid acceleration of Starbucks K-Cups, the expanded partnership with Keurig on the Vue platform and the announcement of Starbucks Verismo.", "The quarter reflects our ability and commitment to drive growth in the current quarter and year, while also investing in the business and in focused innovation to plant the seeds of growth in China, in single-serve, in Blonde, in Evolution Fresh and in Refreshers, that will produce growth in revenues and profitability for years to come. And the quarter just ended once again demonstrates the passion and talent and dedication of our Starbucks partners all around the world.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Mike?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just one quick question on one of the opportunities that we've talked about a little bit in the past. And Howard, you said coffee is at the center of everything you do. But to some extent, so is tea, and it continues to feel like a little bit of an untapped opportunity. And I know there's a new individual kind of in charge of tea. And I was just wondering if you have any thoughts about maybe what is the opportunity in tea, how should we think about that, and how are you approaching that opportunity either the rest of this year or into next year?", "Howard D. Schultz", "Thank you for the question, Keith. Let's level set [ph]. First off, Tazo, within the Starbucks family currently represents on its own $1 billion business in terms of its brand position, in terms of revenue from our store base and in CPG. The acquisition of Evolution is not only to expand and explore the opportunities within juice. But when I talked about this publicly, we spoke about the significant interest and the study we've done around health and wellness. Obviously, we think that the medicinal qualities and the efficacy of tea will play a very large role in the overall category of health and wellness at Starbucks. Today is not the day to talk specifically about Tazo and our future plans, but I can tell you that we recognize the unique opportunities we have with Tazo in multiple channels of distribution as part of our health and wellness initiative, and there'll be more about that in the months and quarters ahead.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I just wanted to get a sense of timing of what's happening in EMEA. The transformational agenda in the U.S. obviously bore fruit very, very quickly, and it included some of your very substantial reorganization of the way that the overall division was managed. So I guess the question is how far along are you in the process, kind of deciding what you want to do in Europe, with being a smaller business but a more profitable business? I mean, I guess to some extent, that was the case in the U.S., be a possibility at least in the short term, and I think in the press release, you talked about new regional strategic initiatives. Is that the type of thing that's already at its peak in the P&L right now, or we could expect margins to increase or might they even get worse in the near term as you continue to invest and figure out what you want to do there?", "Howard D. Schultz", "John, this is Howard. First off, let's split off EMEA into 2 parts, the Western Europe and the Middle East. The Middle East market for Starbucks, in which we have hundreds of stores in the Gulf, is quite healthy, and we continue to feel very bullish about that part of the equation. With regard to Western Europe, let me walk you through what we've done in anticipation of the transformation of that business. First off, one of our most senior and most experienced executives and operators, who is at our side co-authoring the U.S. transformation is Michelle Gass. She has moved to become the President of that region, and she's living in the U.K. In addition to that, the largest company-owned market within that region is the U.K., and we've also moved one of our strongest retail operators from the U.S., Kris Engskov [ph], who is managing the U.K. business reporting to Michelle. I think we -- in a sense, we've seen this movie before, and I'm proud to say it had a very good and positive ending in terms of what we were able to do in the U.S. I think there are many similarities in terms of the downturn in the economy and consumer confidence. And I think that we all feel quite optimistic over the long term that we're going to be able to not only turn this business around, but it's going to be a profitable market for Starbucks. Having said that, the situation is very, very tough and it's not one Europe. The situation in Greece, the situation in Portugal, the situation in Spain, I can go on and on, and then just this morning, we wake up to the news of an announcement of a double-dip recession in Great Britain. So what we've said early on within the U.S. transformation is that we were not going to use the economy as an excuse for our inability to transform and succeed in that market, and we're not using it internally as well. But we can't ignore the headwinds. But I think the short version is that we have put in place a strategic plan that we feel is going to address the issues at hand, in many ways takes a lot of the proven successes we had in the U.S. with Michelle in the lead, and she is getting all the support and resources from the corporation. We also think that we should invest into the market in terms of innovation and be very strategic in how we're going to grow the market. But the short version here is that it's going to take a while. We are cautiously optimistic and we think over the long term, we will succeed in this market, but it's -- this is not going to happen overnight.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.", "Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just wondering maybe if you could talk a little bit about potential weather impact in the quarter in the U.S. and maybe how same-store sales trended or throughout the quarter or by geographic region or some other color based on that.", "Howard D. Schultz", "In all due respect, we do not allow weather to enter the equation of Starbucks comp store sales internally, and we're certainly not going to allow it to enter the conversation publicly. We are going to succeed in good and bad weather. I don't think the weather had any significant impact on comps. I think that 8% comps in the U.S. business on the backdrop of the economic issues is a stunning number. And to be honest with you, I was a little bit surprised to see some of your reactions in terms of disappointment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley.", "John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "The Channel Development category has a number of moving pieces. I think you've actually added several even this past quarter and so it's very difficult, I think, to track it. So 2 questions, one is general and one is more specific. Generally, Troy or whoever would like to take this, could you sketch out maybe the next few quarters if there are major milestones in which pieces of these businesses should drop in? Or if you want to maybe just more generally talk about what you think the revenue from the Channel Development category ought to grow over, say, the next 4 quarters? That's the general one. And specific to that in the K-Cup business, it looks like the 230 million that you shipped in 5 months is a slight deceleration from the previous comments like on a monthly basis. I'm not sure if there's channel loading or that -- not. Can you talk about what the revenue associated with that was specifically? And I think before you said $0.03 to $0.05 accretion, this year, is that still the right way to look at that?", "Troy Alstead", "John, let me start with part of the answer, and then I'm going to turn it over Jeff Hansberry to take more of it. First of all, we have all along said we anticipate a $0.03 to $0.05 of incremental profit impact this year from Starbucks K-Cups, and then a quarter ago I said we expected, given the rapid acceleration and great customer response to that product launch, that we expected the top end of that range and that's still what we expect at this point in time for this year, given the launch as it's progressing throughout the year, right near the top end of that incremental impact is what we would expect. Now certainly, as we move into 2013 and with greater distribution, continued growth and velocity and at that point in time presence in the Starbucks stores we'd certainly expect an additional increment in 2013, and that's something will talk about a bit later. Channel Development continues to be our fastest revenue growing business, and I would expect that to continue to be true as we face the quarters and years ahead for quite some time. There's one mechanical element that everyone should remember, which is we have just as of one month ago lapped the point in time a year ago where we've brought into our P&L and onto our revenue line the packaged coffee revenues as we brought that business back in-house. And so that the consolidation impact will go away from this point forward, so there's a little bit of a trend difference that simply happens as a result of that accounting. But beyond that, Channel Development is progressing rapidly as a bright spot for us, and I'll ask Jeff to address more specifically some elements of his business.", "Jeffery J. Hansberry", "Thanks, Troy. Hi, John. So with regard to K-Cup, we actually shipped more K-Cups in the second quarter than we did in the first. We're very pleased with the progress that we're making on K-Cup and in fact, in the last 4 weeks versus the 4 weeks prior to that, we actually grew share by 210 basis points. So we're continuing to see a very solid ramp in our share growth. We're now getting to the point where we've got distribution built out -- actually continuing to build some additional distribution. We are now turning on our marketing and merchandising efforts. So we expect our K-Cup business to continue to grow going forward.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a -- I have question on the coffee side. You gave a number, Troy, of about $100 million incremental benefit on the commodity. That's a little bit lower than we might have thought, given how far coffee prices have come down. So can you talk a little bit about if -- I'm assuming the average for fiscal '13 is quite a bit above where the current price is on coffee. And could you talk about the outlook for pricing in the retail stores in light of lower prices on coffee.", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, Jason. Yes, what we expect now is that, firstly [ph] we're past the peak of the year-over-year impact, negative impact on our P&L. The peak of that was really the first quarter. The second quarter also included quite an increment of extra expense due to commodities. And that will ease as we go through the balance of this year. There's still some incremental costs, but it will get a bit easier for us. We are now price protected about 11 months of our needs of fiscal 2013, while there's still some open position that it could impact cost for that year. That has given us fairly good visibility now into what that increment looks like. And that's what led to that estimate of at least $100 million benefit to our P&L next year. Now to your point, yes, our average cost in 2013 is higher than where the cost is traded on the open market today. And that's because, as we have said all along, we've been buying throughout this market and buying on the way down. And part of that is about giving us access to and ensuring the supply of the best coffee in the world. That's always our top priority when we're buying coffee. And the second priority is we're moving risk from the P&L and managing that long-term coffee exposure that has led us to that strategy of buying throughout and buying long. That also suggest to me that if coffee prices remain where they are today, I would expect tailwinds in 2013 as I mentioned earlier. And again, it remain where they are today. And that's not a prediction. I don't have that kind of crystal ball. But if they did, that would also suggest better coffee prices for us coming in 2014. So we see the light at the end of the tunnel on commodities, and we're looking forward to that turning around for us on the P&L.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask about the unit development. You raised your guidance to 1,000 units, which was up a lot from last year's 100 or 200. Where do we go from here? For the Americas, for example, is that a stable number, 500, or is that the start of a ramp back up? And when you look beyond that to Asia and emerging markets more broadly, it looks like that's wide open to you. How quickly do you plan to ramp that up over the next several years, and what's the limiter?", "Howard D. Schultz", "Michael, it's Howard. I can't give you a specific number, but let me just share with you what kind of goes into our thinking in terms of the future. A few things. One is that we're quite encouraged that in the U.S., the stores that we've opened over the last 12 months and then in the last 24 are performing extraordinarily well in terms of a class of stores. And in many ways, as good as any new class we've seen in a decade. So any thought of saturation or inability to find quality real estate and continue to expand in the U.S. or for that matter, North America should be taken off the table. I think we're quite encouraged with what's going on in the Americas on a macro level in markets like Brazil. And we touched on that earlier in our prepared comments, we have less than 100 stores in Brazil, and we're seeing very, very strong sales results, and we're going to accelerate under Cliff's leadership the number of stores we can open in Brazil, and in addition to that, places like Argentina and others. We just had a meeting with our Mexican partner, and he feels very strongly that he too can accelerate his growth. And then you get to Asia and China, and we didn't speak specifically about India. But the prospect of having thousands of stores in China alone is no longer a statement that we don't -- it's not a dream. This is a reality. We are -- we've turned the corner in terms of the iconic nature of the brand, the position, the leadership team. And we feel very strongly that we're going to be able to do that effectively. And then John and his team are getting ready to open up India with really the #1 partner in that nation, which is Tata, and we should have great results there. So net-net, I can't envision in the coming years that we would open up less stores than we've just announced and feel very good about the teams that are in place and the trends that are in place. And having just returned from China last week, which was just an extraordinary trip, eye-opener for all of us, I think we are on the cutting edge of becoming really one of the most admired Western brands to enter China in a very long time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I want to go back to Europe, understanding that Middle East and I think that Eastern Europe probably are, as well, are pretty strong for you. Is there anything -- the one thing -- the one distinction between Western Europe and the U.S. a couple of years ago is that you're such a dominant brand and retailer in the U.S., whereas in Europe, it feels like maybe it's a little bit more competitive. So can you just talk broadly about that market and whether or not structurally, there are differences there that might make it harder for you to get margins up? And likewise, whether or not it says anything about how competitive maybe the consumer products market is, given that my sense was that the Krueger partnership would be particularly well-suited to Europe.", "Howard D. Schultz", "I mean, thank you for the question. That's Cliff who was the resident U.K. person with that around the table and used to run that region for us. So Cliff, you want to take that?", "Clifford Burrows", "Yes, I'd like to take it. Thank you, Sara, for the opportunity. I think all the things you said about the dominant position we've had here and the competition in Europe is very, very true, and the economy across each of the markets we're all too well aware of. In each of the markets now, we have very strong leaders. And we, through Michelle, have a very strong president. And we know what we need to do there, and I believe that the team are equipped to do that. And making local -- ourselves locally relevant, whether that's the strength of the coffee in the U.K., or the varietals in France, the fruit assortments in each of those markets, is really the key to this because as you say, very competitive. We focused totally and very intensely on the U.S., Michelle was my business partner at that time as we focused market-by-market here in the U.S. And now that segment tends to come to vary [ph] in Europe, and it is going to have to be country-by-country to beat local competition. And sometimes, that is national chains and sometimes that is very local players. But I think they are very well equipped to do it. And I would just make a comment, having been in the U.K. recently, that places like London are still thriving because of global money and just the strength of those economies. When you get outside of the main cities, it is quite depressing at the moment with streets upon streets of shops with for sale and closure signs, which I think just goes to show how deep that recession is in the U.K. And they are going to do hard work but they're well equipped to do it. I'm absolutely confident that the relevance of the Starbucks proposition from the quality of the coffee to the third place to the people bringing it to the customer, they'll have a great experience, and we will win in each of those markets over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I too have a question on Europe. I know you have a long-term goal of reaching mid-teens margins in that division, and you're talking about certain investments that you're making in this year. Is the thought that some of these bigger margin improvements towards these ultimate goals can really begin in earnest in fiscal '13? And separately, as we think about your business, oftentimes, McDonald's will talk about things that it can do almost a Plan B from its own marketing when things get tough to stabilize sales, maybe give up a little bit on the margin but also create a little bit of a floor on sales. Is there a Plan B for Starbucks when things get tough? Are there things that you can do to help your business in Europe?", "Troy Alstead", "Let me at least take the first part of that question. And I would just say that the investments we're making in Europe are very much about addressing the critical issue we face in the consumer environment at this point in time. And what we're seeing is a very quick response to that. Our consumer -- customer satisfaction scores improved more meaningfully in the second quarter in the U.K. than they had in years. So we know that reaction is already happening. I would expect that the payback would produce and come over time. And I would also react a little bit to your words of the goal of mid-teen margins in Europe. We don't have a goal. We actually have a plan to get to mid-teen margins. We have a vision toward the elements and how that margin march will happen over a period of time, including improvement in top line through our engagement with customers, a disciplined focus on the middle of the P&L as a part of that effort, improvement in the overall infrastructure, supply chain, G&A and otherwise over time. So we have a very well-thought through plan that we are as confident as ever. What we can't control and predict it so much is the macro environment but needless to say, our plan A is approaching investments in Europe both from customer side, the P&L side and the infrastructure side remains the same and I think you'll see us approach that consistently from here forward.", "Howard D. Schultz", "Let me add one thing. I think many of you were around 3 years ago, 4 years ago on conference calls just like this when the headlines around Starbucks and the inability of us potentially to navigate through the financial crisis and, to be honest, some self-induced mistakes. I don't know how many of you would honestly say today that you thought that we would be able to not only transform the business but in fact, produce record revenue and record profits. I will tell you unequivocally, and you can hold us to this, that we will turn the European business around in the same way that we turned the U.S. business around. I can't tell you when and I can't tell you with specificity what the margins are going to be but we will emerge as the leader in Europe the same way we emerged as the constant leader in the U.S. The advantage that we have going forward in Europe versus the U.S. is that we have fantastic JV partners in many of these markets, who will understand consumer behavior based on living in those markets, have the leverage and the understanding of how to navigate through the storm, they've seen it before. We also have less of a store base so the problem is not as big. And then lastly, we are looking for ways to leverage licensed partners in very unique types of real estate. For example, we just opened in train stations in France with a license partner, and we are opportunistically looking at ways to offset the burden on the P&L that we have today with many of the company-owned stores based on license opportunities that we have not yet taken advantage of. The one thing we learned in the U.S. that if we would've known, we would've invested heavily ahead of the problem, which we did not do. And so we're confident we will turn this around, and we're going to be opportunistic about our abilities and when we come out of this, we're in a stronger position. But please, I don't want anyone to leave this phone call with any feeling whatsoever about the lack of confidence that we have as a management team, with Michelle and Kris [ph] in that region, that we will absolutely turn the situation in Europe around despite the significant headwinds that we are facing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I'm going to shift back to the Americas, and the comp obviously was very strong and has been very strong for quite a while. And Troy, when we saw you recently, the day part still seemed like it was relatively skewed to the morning as it has been forever. So I'm just curious on throughput in the morning, what you're seeing there? Obviously, there's continued improvement getting those lines to move faster. How much faster we can go, kind of where the ceiling is on the morning?", "Clifford Burrows", "Sharon, this is Cliff. Let me just set up the day for you because you're absolutely right, morning remains our strongest period, and we continue to see increased transactions in the morning. But I'm delighted to say we are seeing growth in all day parts, and that is very encouraging because we are focused on building capacity in the morning to deal with the increasing customers coming through. At the same time, as you know, we've worked with our food programs to stretch some of those other day parts whether it's bistro boxes in a lunch program or Cake Pops in the more afternoon treat. And as you know we're trying a few things to lengthen the day and for the evening. And I have to say very encouraged by all of those. Since time, the work we started 3 years ago, 4 years ago now with lean and improving our efficiencies so that we can get people through more quickly while paying much more personal attention to them, we have -- still have considerable runway. And although we're achieving really record transactions every day on our New York stores, we are confident we can continue to do that. So we'll grow our transactions, I'm confident, and we'll continue to focus on food attach for all day parts. So we have a lot of runway ahead of us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.", "Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to ask a question about your packaged coffee business. And just in terms of what you're seeing, I guess what appears to be moderating pricing yet faster volume growth. What are the drivers of this? And then do you think you're achieving the right balance here between pricing and then volume growth for this business?", "Howard D. Schultz", "Jeff?", "Jeffery J. Hansberry", "Bonnie, it's Jeff Hansberry. We think that we are, and we have seen recent continued share growth in the Starbucks packaged coffee brand. And that coming through Q2, it's very significant and important for us at this milestone quarter as we cycle through our first full year of a direct model, and at the same time moved into Starbucks Blonde Roast, which represents an opportunity for us to better serve a broader segment of coffee customers outside of our retail stores, where we're seeing growth driven by not only the introduction of Blonde Roast but also we have grown share by over 100 basis points during the quarter -- during a period when we faced a significant competitive launch by the Gevalia brand. So we feel like we're striking the right balance, maintaining loyalty with our current customers and bringing new customers to the Starbucks franchise while maintaining and defending our premium position.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "So that concludes our call today.

Starbucks today is a true multichannel global retailer that is both uniquely and ideally positioned to continue delivering solid, top, and bottom line performance to our shareholders into the future.", "Our record Q3 EPS of $0.43 represented a 19% increase over last year\u2019s then record $0.36 per share and reflected the success of multiple innovative Channel Development initiatives and the continued profitable growth in our business in the key Americas and China and Asia-Pacific regions where comp growth was 7% and 12% respectively.", "I\u2019m particularly pleased with the increasing operating leverage we are seeing, demonstrated by 120 basis point increase in our operating margin over last year and a 19% increase in EPS on a 13% increase in sales to a Q3 record of $3.3 billion in sales. All this translated into our 11th consecutive quarter of record operating results.", "Noteworthy is that we achieved our Q3 results despite high legacy commodity costs, primarily coffee, in a challenging, economic, and consumer headwind in most of the markets in which we operate. We fully expect the operating leverage unique to our business model to enable us to continue driving EPS growth in excess of revenue growth over the long run.", "While the record performance we reported today demonstrates our ability to continue driving significant consistent revenue and earnings growth, as with many leading restaurant retailers and consumer brands reporting earnings over the last few weeks, the fragile global economy, uncertainty in Europe, high unemployment in the U.S., a resumed decline in home sales and further diminished consumer confidence did have an impact on our business in Q3. Nonetheless, we are responsible for positively navigating through the uncertain economic climate we are operating in today and I assure you we are and will continue to do so.", "In a few minutes, Troy will share more detail around our Q3 performance, discuss adjustments we have made to our Q4 targets in response to the current environment and share our FY 2013 outlook. But first I want to lay out a few of the steps we are taking to navigate through today\u2019s headwinds, including redoubling our efforts to examine all facets of our business and make certain that we are operating and executing with maximum efficiency, maintaining a laser focus on cost, deepening our connection with consumers and delivering an enhanced experience to our customers around the world.", "To best accomplish these key objectives, in Q1, we moved to a three-region global business model in which the Americas, China-Asia Pacific, and EMEA regions are each headed by seasoned Starbucks leaders; Cliff Burrows, John Culver and Michelle Gass respectively, each of whom has more than 10 years with the Company and reports directly to me.", "Our new business model has enabled us to decentralize the operations, eliminate redundancies in support center and regional operations, become more locally relevant, and improve Starbucks\u2019 execution on the ground in each of the markets around the world in which we compete and we are already beginning to see the tangible benefits of our ongoing decentralization initiatives with stabilization of both top line and bottom line performance in the EMEA region. as customer-facing initiatives and cost-control measures initiated by the team have taken effect, and as the team pursues opportunities to optimize our EMEA store portfolio.", "I\u2019m confident that our increasingly more responsive and nimble three-region global business structure positions Starbucks to operate with the clarity, the flexibility and the customer centricity required to respond to current and the future headwinds and to drive sustained long-term profitable growth across our business and around the world.", "Now succeeding today and in the future however, it will take much more than laser-focused execution and cost discipline. It will require a bold and relevant innovation. As we prepare for the holiday season and accelerate its store growth in fiscal 2013, we do so with a robust pipeline of innovation, highlighted by the much anticipated introduction of Verismo and on the heels of exciting recent new product introductions.", "Let me highlight a few examples for you. Leverage a proprietary breakthrough innovation that features natural green coffee extract. This month we will have Starbucks Refreshers through more than 10,800 Starbucks stores in the U.S. and in 15 international markets. Starbucks Refreshers represents Starbucks entry into the $8 billion energy drink category, the fastest growing category in measured CPG channels that was up 16% in last year alone. Besides representing a fantastic new product platform, Refreshers is the most recent example of our blueprint for profitable growth in action.", "Let me explain. We simultaneously launched the product globally and multiple channels of distribution including handcrafted ready to drink and VIA versions in our stores and ready to drink in VIA versions through over 50,000 points of CPG distribution all supported by a national advertising campaign.", "Earlier reports suggest that Refreshers are proving to be a big hit with our consumers through both in-store and CPG channel sales. As you know, earlier in this fiscal year, we acquired Evolution Fresh with a strategic intent to build the national health and wellness brand and revolutionalize the fresh juice business.", "We have been very encouraged by customer response to our first Evolution Fresh retail store in Bellevue, Washington, and just last week, we opened our second of Evolution Fresh store this one in Downtown Seattle. We also announced plans to open an additional store in San Francisco later this year and now have plans to build a new juice manufacturing facility in Southern California that will have four to five times of production and packaging capability of the current Evolution Fresh facility.", "We now offer Evolution Fresh ready-to-drink juices in over 800 stores in Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Diego and have plans to double that number in the coming months as sales are exceeding our own internal expectations. Starbucks\u2019 $1.5 billion of food program in our U.S. company-owned stores is an important part of our core business that has grown at double-digit pace in each of the last two fiscal years and over the first two quarters of this year.", "With roughly one-third of all transactions now having a food attachment, our food program represents a significant opportunity for us to continue growing our business across multiple channels into the future. and with the La Boulange transaction now completed, we have already begun the journey of bringing wholesome and delicious unique, fresh and French baked food to the U.S. marketplace in way similar to how Starbucks first brought romance of the Italian espresso bar to many North American coffee consumers.", "Customers will first see the new bakery offerings in our San Francisco Bay Area stores with other markets following over time. We\u2019ll be sharing more about our plans for La Boulange in the months ahead. As I said before, evolving, social and digital media platforms and highly innovative and relevant mobile payment capabilities are causing seismic changes in consumer behavior and creating equally seismic disruptive opportunities for business.", "Starbucks identified the power of mobile payment capabilities earlier than most retailers, restaurants, and consumer brands, and now have processed over 55 million transactions since launching it in January 2011. and today, we operate one of the world\u2019s largest mobile payment programs processing over 1 million mobile transactions per week in the U.S. alone.", "Starbucks is committed to innovating and extending our leadership position in mobile payment technologies and in Q3, we launched the Starbucks mobile payment app for Android in Canada and the U.K. further extending the mobile payment experience to 14,000 Starbucks locations. But with smartphones representing less than 20% of the 6.1 billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide, we know that the world is only in a very early nascent stages of the mobile payment revolution.", "Starbucks digital team led by Adam Brotman has a clear line of sight on next-generation mobile payment technologies, and is deep into developing strategies to integrate next-generation capabilities into our global mobile payment program in ways that will materially enhance and deepen our connection to our customers around the world and give us a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace going forward.", "In Q3, Starbucks opened 231 net new stores around the world, including our 600th store in mainland China and our first stores in each of Costa Rica and Finland. With these openings, Starbucks is well on its way to opening the 1,000 net new stores we committed to opening in 2012. I am pleased to announce today that Starbucks will open an additional 1,200 net new stores in fiscal 2013, primarily in the U.S. and the China and Asia-Pacific regions. John Culver, President of Starbucks China and Asia-Pacific will be speaking shortly about the continued momentum in China and provide you with an update on the progress of our very exciting plans to open our first stores in India later this year.", "Coffee will remain at the core of everything we do as we grow our business around the world and into the future. I\u2019m particularly proud of the fact that cumulative sales within our Channel Development, CPG segment, led by President, Jeff Hansberry, that primarily includes our consumer packaged and soluble coffee products has reached $1 billion earlier this month for the first time in our 41-year history. And at the premium coffee segment of the coffee industry, a segment Starbucks created, now accounts for over 50% of total coffee U.S. sales through grocery and drug and mass channels according to IRI.", "This is a very important statistic in fact I want to share with you. With a 28.2% share of premium coffee in these channels, up from 25.6% last year, Starbucks is a definitive premium coffee category leader. We are continuing to distance and differentiate ourselves from competitors by driving relevant innovation across both the Starbucks and the Seattle\u2019s Best brands including VIA, Blonde Roast, K-Cup and our new roasting architecture that makes it easier for customers to select their favorite coffee strength.", "Starbucks will continue to play a leading role with the expansion of new forms and flavors in VIA and K-Cups. and we are already the second largest player in the premium single-cup market with Starbucks K-Cups continuing to make good progress against our volume distribution, and share growth plans and have already shipped more than 350 million K-Cups since last November\u2019s launch. We are anticipating further growth of our premium single-cup business with the availability of Starbucks branded Vue packs for Green Mountain's new Keurig Vue brewer this fall.", "Finally, I could not be more enthused and excited about the launch of the Verismo System by Starbucks, our premium single-cup category innovation that will be a game changer for the single-cup industry and available for sale in time for the holiday season, shopping season.", "Verismo produces the highest quality, best tasting, and in-home or in-office single-serve espresso and coffee beverages anywhere bar none and is the first and only single-serve machine that uses pods made from real milk and delivers beverage quality and versatility meeting Starbucks exacting standards. Verismo machines and pods will initially be available in Starbucks retail stores as well as through select specialty and department stores in the U.S. and Canada through retail channels and targeted European markets and on starbucksstore.com. Commitments and initial orders from retailers for the holiday season have exceeded even our most optimistic expectations, and obviously bode well for the holiday seasons.", "In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our partners around the world for all they do to bring the Starbucks Experience to life for our customers. The record results we shared today would not be possible without their passion, dedication, and commitment to making the perfect beverage for every customer, everyday one cup at a time.", "I want to ensure our partners and shareholders that our experience over the past four years has provided us with the muscle memory, the discipline, and the leadership to successfully navigate through any economic conditions that need come our way now or in the future.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Troy.", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon, every one. Our fiscal third quarter results extend or run of record earnings to 11 consecutive quarters, and more importantly reflect a steady profit progression as we continue to grow traffic domestically, expand our retail footprint internationally and innovate in our Channel Development business.", "Howard spoke to the unprecedented external challenges that currently faced retailers, yet we continue to get consumers reasons for coming back to our stores and other reasons to try Starbucks for the first time. Whether its new offerings that resonate with customers in that service, our store partners provide or rewards that holds great value during fragile times like these. We continue to thoughtfully press forward on our blue print for profitable growth with great success.", "Today, I\u2019ll provide more contexts on our third quarter performance as well as update you on our full year projection, then I\u2019ll provide our initial outlook for fiscal 2013. Third quarter revenues grew to $3.3 billion, 13% higher than a year ago. Our 6% global comps were the largest driver of the growth with continued progress in our Channel Development business also contributing.", "Operating income of $492 million was 22% higher than last year, and 14% higher than last quarter. We\u2019re seeing sales leverage continue to increase, while the high commodity cost that had been so impactful on our P&L over the past two years are easing.", "Commodity, primarily coffee still had a negative impact on our Q3 operating income of $38 million and 110 basis points on margin. but as anticipated that is lower than the first and second quarters and we expect the impact to further lessen in fourth quarter.", "Earnings per share grew 19% to a Q3 record of $0.43. This was $0.01 below the revised target range we provided in early June largely due to slowing in June in the U.S., which I\u2019ll come back to in a moment. Despite that slowing in June, our Americas business continued to produce strong results in the third quarter.", "Net revenues of $2.5 billion were 9% higher than the third quarter of last year driven by comparable store sales growth of 7% in our company-operated stores and 24% revenue growth in our licensed stores. The comp store sales growth was comprised of 5% growth in transaction and a 2% increase in average ticket.", "Continuing the recent trend, transaction growth was driven by contributions from our still-growing warming program, incrementalities from Blonde Roast and increasing throughput efficiencies in the busy morning daypart. The 24% licensed store revenue growth was driven by new products, pricing, and same-store sales growth. The continued success of our licensed operations gives us confidence as we continue to expand our licensed store portfolio in our Americas segment and throughout the world.", "Specific to the U.S., third quarter comparable store sales grew 7% driven by 5% growth in traffic. Our U.S. stores produced record transaction levels this quarter, including consistent growth across all dayparts demonstrating that the initiatives to grow mid-day and afternoon traffic are producing results, while the initiatives to expand our tea daypart continue to gain traction. But as mentioned a moment ago, we did see slowing in June amid a weakening consumer environment.", "Traffic trends are noticeably down in many areas across the U.S. and the soft traffic trends have continued in July. Americas operating income grew by 14% in the quarter with operating margin expanding by 90 basis points to 20.7%, despite the negative 70 basis point impact of higher commodity cost. Sales leverage drove the improvement in the third quarter.", "Despite the recent softening in the U.S., our Americas business continues to produce outstanding returns. The pipeline of innovation, as Howard took you through in his comments is a deep source of opportunity, and will be a key driver of our future results. Our partners are positioned to seamlessly execute on these initiatives just as they have done with Blonde Roast and with Refreshers, and we will continue to give our customers great products, great experiences, and great value.", "Moving now to the Europe, Middle East and Africa region where the third quarter results reflect a beginning of stabilization in that region even in the face of difficult conditions. We\u2019re starting to see the benefit of the consumer initiatives we put in place. Espresso sales are strengthening as we focused on proving to customers that we have the best latte on the high street. Our stores look better than ever as we\u2019ve renovated 70 stores in London so far this year and are ready to show our progress to the world during the Olympics. While we recognize that this turnaround will not be a quick one, the early indicators are encouraging.", "Revenues for the third quarter in EMEA grew 9%, largely driven by the consolidation of results from the acquisition of our Switzerland and Austria markets last August. Our same-store sales were flat to last year\u2019s third quarter, despite a persistent underlying economic instability in those markets. We did see continued growth in our markets in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East, which have fared much better than those in Western Europe.", "Operating income of $2.6 million was down from $4.9 million last year, and margin of 0.9% declined 100 basis points from last year\u2019s Q3, due largely to transition costs related to the new distribution model we began rolling out in the UK earlier this fiscal year. That transition is now nearly complete, and we look forward to the efficiencies and improvements it will bring both to our stores and on our P&L in fiscal \u201813.", "One of the many components of our Renaissance Plan, our plan to profitably transform the EMEA business, it is optimizing our portfolio, both through active management of store real estate and through optimum market equity positioning. This portfolio optimization is even more important given the continued economic uncertainty in the region and we are currently conducting a more thorough portfolio review with related actions planning for Europe. This is similar to the work we did several years ago in our U.S. business, which left us with a much healthier store portfolio. As a result, we may revise our equity position in certain geographies and potentially close more stores in Europe over the next few quarters beginning in the fourth quarter.", "Depending on the outcome of the evaluation work we\u2019re doing, it is possible that we might incur additional charges in the fourth quarter related to the store portfolio work. While we don\u2019t yet have a final determination of numbers of stores to close, I anticipate any potential charges in Q4 related to the store closures and to the many other initiatives in place to transform EMEA will be less than $20 million with perhaps up to an additional $10 million during the first half of 2013. As in the U.S. several years ago, targeted closures of unprofitable stores and the resulting stronger portfolio will enhance our ability to deliver more consistent earnings growth in EMEA.", "I\u2019d like to now shift the discussion to China and Asia/Pacific, and the President of that region John Culver is here to take you through those results.", "John Culver", "Thanks, Troy. Good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be joining the call today to discuss the record results for the China and Asia/Pacific regions. Our fastest growing regions made up of 12 markets more than 3,000 stores and nearly 50,000 partners who serve more than 9 million customers per week. As you can see from our results, the growth story in China and Asia/Pacific is becoming a meaningful component of the Starbucks growth story. The region continues to expand its contribution to total company profitability raising from 9% two years ago to nearly 13% this year-to-date.", "Today, we have a balanced portfolio driven by four significant geographies within the region. Each of these is in their own stage of growth led by the rapid expansion of China, our future second home market and including our partnerships in Japan, Korea and throughout Southeast Asia. This region has produced strong double-digit comps for 10 consecutive quarters, and while these levels are moderating to a more sustainable pace. I continue to have great confidence about our future performance given the investment we\u2019ve made in our strong new store returns.", "Before I focus on our future, let me walk you through our third quarter results. Our financial performance met our high expectations as we delivered another strong quarter in the 30s. That is revenue growth of 31%, coupled with operating income growth of 37% and an operating profit margin of nearly 34%. These strong results were delivered while we continue to invest in a focused and disciplined way to further fuel the future growth for the region.", "On the revenue side of the equation as expected, we are evolving to a more balanced revenue growth model as quarterly comps normalized to the low to mid teen levels in the near-term. This natural shift is occurring as the business moves from a heavy reliance upon comparable store sales growth to a balance of growth from comps and unit expansion in both our high-return company-owned markets and within our profitable well-capitalized partnership markets. Our 12% comps this quarter were driven by an 8% increase in transactions as well as expansion of our average ticket. Driving his outstanding performance is a growing brand awareness across all of our markets.", "Now, there are few things we\u2019re reinforcing relative to our business performance in the third quarter. Two year comps are at a phenomenal 38% actually rising from what we posted in the second quarter. Our company-operated average unit volumes across the region are expected to end the year at approximately $850,000, up 71% from just three years ago. In China, despite headlines centering around an economic slowdown, our same-store sales continued to grow by double-digits yet again in the third quarter. This was against the backdrop of a very difficult comparative last year.", "Additionally, customer service scores in China and in fact throughout the region reached an all-time high in the quarter, and in the 15 months since the My Starbucks Rewards program was introduced in China, over 700,000 customers have embraced the program. That\u2019s more than 1,200 members per store, roughly three times the level of the U.S. programs.", "Given these highlights, and the acceptance we\u2019re seeing everyday with consumers across the regions, we continue to be extremely confident in our ability to drive strong same-store sales growth, while at the same time continuing to grow our store base even more aggressively.", "Operating income and GAAP was also strong increasing 37% to $61 million in the third quarter. Operating margin grew 140 basis points to 33.8% as we continue to gain leverage on sales. Partially offsetting the growth and income were costs associated with our rapid pace of growth in new stores and the investments in infrastructure we are making across the region.", "Our local teams continue to do an excellent job, the flow in our growing revenue through to the bottom line to display inflationary pressure. And as a result, we now are expected to finish fiscal 2012 with operating margins at the high end of our previously stated range of 30% to 35%.", "Let me now be more specific regarding the future prospects of a few key markets. In China, we\u2019ve been aggressive about our plans to capture more of the massive potential of that market. With high-store margins and low-store penetration given the size of the country we are in the very early stages of what we think this market can ultimately reach.", "We are targeting 1,500 stores on the mainland by 2015. That\u2019s a compounded growth rate of 34% from today. I\u2019m pleased to report that we are making excellent progress towards that target as we opened 42 new stores in Q3, nearly twice the amount we opened in Q3 a year-ago. We\u2019ll ramp that number up significantly in the fourth quarter continuing to be on track to open 200 stores by the end of the year. As Howard mentioned earlier, I would like to congratulate the China team on the opening of the 600 store. This is yet another exciting milestone in our growth plans for the market.", "To support our future growth ambition in China, we\u2019ve established a solid talent acquisition and management pipeline. We\u2019ve hired more than 1,400 new retail partners this quarter compared with 900 in Q2, and we continue to prioritize the development of our people, investing more than 41,000 hours in training in Q3 compared with 35,000 hours in Q2. We\u2019ve also built local capabilities to lead important areas of our business, like store designs, product innovation, and research and development. We know that our 10,000 Chinese partners will continue to be a significant competitive differentiator for us in defining our long-term success.", "Let me now turn for a moment to our single biggest contributor to the outstanding regional profitability reported today, Japan. Our first market outside of North America, Japan continued to provide a solid foundation upon which the region is built. Our business in Japan is extremely healthy and as we approach our 1,000 store in this market, we continue to remain confident about its future growth prospects.", "Beyond China and Japan, we are profitable in every other single country in which we operate. I\u2019m particularly encouraged by our strong results and aggressive growth plans in key geographies like Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia. India also represents a significant growth opportunity in the future for the company. Our plans to open our first store in India this year with our business partner Tata remains on track.", "In closing, I\u2019m incredibly proud and want to recognize all of our partners throughout the China and Asia/Pacific region for the significant contribution they have made to our success. Our record Q3 results demonstrate why we believe this region represents the largest and fastest retail growth opportunity for the company in the foreseeable future.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over Troy to discuss the results from Channel Development. Troy?", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks John. Channel Development had another stellar quarter and we\u2019re beginning to see many of the complementary offerings within this business come together to drive growth. Revenue grew 45% in the third quarter to $316 million, up nearly $100 million over last Q3.", "Starbucks K-Cups which continued to grow share and distribution were the largest driver of the year-over-year increase. As Howard mentioned premium coffee is now the largest segment of the coffee markets with premium single-cup making up nearly 20% of the market. Starbucks though our K-Cup and VIA offering commands a nearly 22% share of the premium single-cup space. In the coming months, we\u2019ll add Verismo to our product line up and is quickly expanding market.", "In the third quarter, we also saw meaningful growth in packaged coffee. Remember, we transitioned this business in-house more than a year-ago in March of 2011. So the increase in packaged coffee revenue this quarter was real year-over-year of sales growth. Including Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee, nearly 32% of sales of premium packaged coffee in food, drug and mass channels in the third quarter belonged to Starbucks. That share is increasing and reflects the success we\u2019ve had with the direct distribution model and the contribution from innovations such as Blonde Roast.", "Operating income for Channel Development in the third quarter was $86 million, a 25% increase over the same quarter last year, resulting in operating margin of 27.3% despite higher commodity cost which added 500 basis points of pressure in the quarter.", "We continue to be enthusiastic about the growth of our Channel Development business is driving, and how it\u2019s contributing to our bottom line. In fact because of the results through the first three quarters of fiscal 2012, we are now targeting Channel Development margin slightly above our previous guidance of 25% for the full-year.", "Before I move into the outlook for 2013, I want to provide an update on how we expect to finish fiscal 2012. Recognizing the continued deterioration in the macro environment that all retailers face along the trends from June and July, we now expect revenue growth from the fourth quarter of between 10% to 12%. We continue to expect mid single-digit comp growth, with continued strong growth in Channel Development also contributing to the revenue increase.", "We\u2019re also revising our earnings per share guidance in light of current trends. We now expect earnings per share of $0.44 to $0.45 in the fourth quarter that represents earnings growth of between 19% and 22% over the prior fourth quarter non-GAAP results, despite the fragile global economy, challenging consumer environment and still unfavorable commodity costs. Note that any potential charges that might become necessary related to the Europe\u2019s store portfolio work I discussed earlier are not reflected in the Q4 earnings target.", "Now, as we look ahead to fiscal 2013, we\u2019re charting a path to another year of strong growth. We expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 13% driven by mid single-digit comp growth, approximately at 1,200 net new stores and continued strength in Channel Development. The 1,200 net new stores represent 20% acceleration in new store developments. Roughly half of our net new stores will come from the Americas with majority of those in the U.S. where new stores continue to produce very solid returns.", "Licensed stores represent half of the 600 openings. In China and Asia/Pacific we\u2019re targeting approximately 500 net new stores in fiscal \u201813, a 25% increase over fiscal \u201812 with more than half in China. Roughly two-thirds of CAP\u2019s 500 net new stores will be licensed. In EMEA, it consistent with fiscal 2012, we will open approximately 100 net new stores with roughly two-thirds have been licensed. The growth in new stores combined with additions in production capacity to support recently announced initiatives means an increase in capital expenditures, which we project at approximately $1 billion in fiscal \u201813. As a percentage of revenue that is consistent with our projected FY \u201812 spend.", "Full-year consolidated operating margin is expected to grow by approximately 500 to 100 basis points over fiscal \u201812 as we continue to drive leverage. Earnings per share growth in fiscal \u201813 is expected in our target range of 15% to 20% or EPS of between $2.04 and $2.14. Given the uncertainty in the macro environment, we will update our estimate as we move on throughout the year.", "With regard to coffee, we are virtually locked for fiscal \u201813 at prices favorable for 2012. We\u2019ve also begun purchasing into fiscal \u201814 and we\u2019ll continue to do so as prices dip to opportunistic levels as dictated by our internal analytics. Coffee cost will finally be a tailwind in 2013.", "Dairy costs, however, are now expected to be meaningfully higher in fiscal \u201813. Dairy is a much smaller portion of our overall cost of goods than coffee, so while the impact will offset some of the coffee benefit, there will remain a net (inaudible) benefit to P&L of approximately $100 million in 2013.", "Further as I\u2019ve indicated before, we expect increased investments in a number of areas in 2013, totaling potentially up to $50 million. These investments include our Global Leadership Conference scheduled in October and expected to cost approximately $35 million and potential additional investments to accelerate growth in Brazil and China and did better position at EMEA business for future earnings growth and margin improvements.", "We expect our recent acquisitions of La Boulange and Evolution Fresh to be modestly dilutive to earnings in fiscal \u201813 as we continue to invest in testing and rollout in our stores. These impacts are factored into the targets I\u2019ve already discussed. And finally, our fiscal 2013 tax rate is expected to remain low at approximately 33%.", "As we\u2019ve laid out for you today, Starbucks has much in front of us in the coming quarter and year. Our focus is sharp, our growth ambition is high and the opportunity is vast. We\u2019re actively making the right moves to improve our immediate economics, while building diverse sustainable growth channels that will drive long-term shareholder value.", "As within a growth story, the path will not always be a straight one; economic slowdown, high expectations and many other challenges will arise along the way. But this is an entrepreneurial company and we\u2019ve become very good at cutting through that noise and focusing on the end goals; the goal that sees our coffee as the undisputed, unmatched favor across the globe. The goal that sees us as a clear cut leader in innovation and customer experience, while building a growing and vital, social and digital realm, the goal that sees our customers as the most loyal, most enthusiastic and most satisfied in our space, and the goal that leads to a sustained long-term growth in earnings and in shareholder value.", "We\u2019ve discussed a great deal today and I\u2019m sure there are many questions. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Latonia?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "", "Howard D. Schultz", "", "Hello. Operator, I can\u2019t hear the question?", "Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Hello.", "", "Howard D. Schultz", "", "Yep.", "Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "Hi, can you hear me now?", "Howard D. Schultz", "", "Yes, we can hear you Joe, go ahead.", "Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, sorry about that. Troy, could you reconcile the comments about slowing U.S. growth and yet I think for the fourth quarter, you\u2019re still focusing mid-single digit comps and that doesn\u2019t seeing different from what you\u2019re saying in terms of guidance for the third quarter, and the 7% number you just registered for the third quarter looked quite good, so I guess I\u2019m little bit confused on the comment about the slowing U.S. numbers and then the mid-single digit comp growth forecast for the fourth quarter and for fiscal '13?", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks Joe. Here is how I would distinguish that is, we have been at the top end and even occasionally in quarters over the past couple of years above the mid-single digit range and comp growth as you know, and that continued with our 7% comp growth in the U.S. in the third quarter. As we moved into June, we continue to remain in that mid-single digit range, but not quite at the top end of it as or above it as we have been in recent quarter. So, as we move into the fourth quarter, it's important for me to just emphasize that we still expect to grow traffic in our stores. We still expect to expand margins in our business. We expect a very healthy improving AUV in our stores to record levels this year. All that will continue, now that's changed, but the growth trajectory is just slightly lower than that top end of that target range for that I\u2019ve been talking about for quite some time.", "Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And is that the principal driver then behind the slower overall revenue growth or are there other factors that we should think about?", "Troy Alstead", "That's all \u2013 the revenue growth that we\u2019ve retargeted for Q4 really is driven by that uncertainty that we're seeing in the month of June and in July in our U.S. business, and that's really driving that change right now. We continue to expect very strong growth in our Channels Development business as we move into the fourth quarter. China, Asia Pacific, the freight train continues rolling, perhaps even accelerating as we saw in the two year comp growth numbers in the third quarter. We've begun to be encouraged by the turnaround we're starting to see early days up in Europe. So, things are firing quite nicely for us, and we just have seen a bit of a downturn in the U.S. and we're cautious about that.", "Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia \u2013 William Blair", "Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to ask actually a two-pronged question. First on the slowdown you're seeing in the U.S., just wondering if that's pretty broad based, or if you've seen it more in the afternoon. It seemed like the last slowdown, you saw more discretionary spending in your afternoon day-part. And then secondarily on the new store development, it just seems like you're a little bit behind on company-owned development in the U.S. There\u2019s a lot that has to open here in the fourth quarter, so could you talk to us about the pipeline and your comfort in accelerating that into 2013?", "Troy Alstead", "Sure, Sharon. First of all on the pipeline, we have very high expectations for the number of stores that we'll open in this fourth quarter. It is quite a lot have been coming here very shortly. We\u2019re extremely confident in targets we\u2019ve laid out for store growth targets this year in all our geographies. And in fact, over the last two to three years with outstanding new store economics we\u2019ve been producing across our geographies in the Americas and in China/Asia-Pacific we\u2019ve been deepening our capabilities, deepening our governance, deepening our analytics, all preparing for this acceleration that we\u2019re in the midst of right now. So we have a very, very healthy new store pipeline as we begin to move through this fourth quarter and into fiscal 2013 and great confidence in our ability to meet or exceed that target next year.", "In terms of the moderate, and I just want to emphasize the word moderate, traffic slowdown as we moved into June, it was really very broad-based. There's no individual part of the business or day-part that we can point to. There is no geography across the U.S. we can point to. There seem to have been just very broad-based overarching change in the consumer feel. Again, we continue to grow traffic very healthily in that June period. Just not quite at the \u2013 and as rapid a pace as we had in the periods prior to that.", "Sharon Zackfia \u2013 William Blair", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Thank you. I guess you are guiding to 15% to 20% EPS growth next year, and I guess my question is how can you have confidence, and how come we have confidence in that given it was hard to forecast this quarter with only three weeks left in the quarter when you last spoke publicly. I mean why not take a more conservative approach towards \u201813 or do you feel like 15% to 20% is being conservative for \u201913, and if so, why?", "Howard Schultz", "Michael, I think that we believe strongly that 15% to 20% is achievable. I want to be careful not to say it\u2019s conservative. I don\u2019t think it is, but it takes a great deal of work across all our business to deliver that kind of consistent steady growth. What surprised us in Q3 was a very quick change in the month of June that even at the beginning of June had not really begun to be apparent to us. And so that did lead to us being surprised by how the quarter ended as we've said earlier.", "But given everything we see today, even with these trends in place, given what we know is coming in terms of product innovation, given our confidence in the holiday period that we have coming up, giving the momentum we have in China/Asia Pacific, the improving turnaround that we are seeing the early signs of in Europe, all those things give us confidence at this early stage in that 15% to 20% earnings target for next year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer \u2013 UBS", "Thank you. My question is built upon those other questions. You\u2019re talking about same-store sales having deteriorated lately, yet you're talking about us, the company holding mid-single digit type same-store sales over the next \u2013 not just the next quarter, but over the next year. Is there \u2013 I assume that the company is seeing a new level of stability at this new level of same-store sales, first, maybe you can address that. And also perhaps there are things that you see that you can do and that you have in your innovation pipeline that can really help assure that even if the environment does continue to deteriorate, that perhaps you can cause that same-store sales in the mid-single digits to be maintained in fiscal '13? Thanks.", "Howard Schultz", "Dave, this is Howard. I think in a conversation like this it's very easy to use some words that can be misinterpreted. So let's just rewind the last five minutes or so, so there's no misunderstanding. We had 7% U.S. comp growth and 6% global comp growth for the quarter. We would take that any quarter over the 41 year history of the company. It's stunning accomplishment given the backdrop of the economic issues.", "What Troy said, and I think it's important to just to make sure there is no misunderstanding, we saw a moderate change in June, but the numbers that Starbucks now has are so big that a moderate change in transactions and comps can have a swift and acute change to the economics of our current quarter, and because it happened in June, we did not have the time or the nimbleness to really affect change. The pipeline for innovation that we have planned for fiscal '13 is probably a stronger pipeline as we ever had with center piece going to be Verismo for holiday, but that's just the beginning.", "I think we took a very conservative approach by lowering the estimate for Q4. It's responsible and it's the right thing to do. But let me reiterate on behalf of Troy and I, that we are completely locked in the hip that we believe strongly in the guidance that we've given for 2013, and if you look at the last four years since 2008, we've had a 11 consecutive quarters of record results.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi, great, thank you. If I may Troy in the past you've kind of given us margins by segment or at least basis point increases on margin per segment in previous guidance and given various moving pieces in your business it would be great if we could have that and maybe just kind of again clarifying something that you've said earlier. The 4Q charges that you're contemplating if we're kind of transforming Europe in the fourth quarter and then in the first half of '13, are those numbers included in your guidance, and I know it's three things.", "But finally this is really, a question maybe for Howard as well, but you haven't shown leverage on the labor side at the U.S. store level in the past couple of quarters including this one, but also in previous one despite what has been very good comps in any other operating expense side. And I do understand that there\u2019s been some staffing up around the peak morning day-part, but might we have an opportunity for labor to begin to turn around the other direction as you begin to lap some of those initiatives. So, three parts, margin by segment whether the charges are included and then opportunity to leverage labor?", "Troy Alstead", "Okay. John, I'll take the first two, and then perhaps Howard and/or Cliff will jump into the last part of your question. First of all, through the margins by segment, we will provide our expectations to you as we get a little bit closer to fiscal '13. This is the time of year where [we haven\u2019t had] the opportunity to give you our initial expectations given the many moving parts that we see, but I\u2019ll just acknowledge we\u2019re also deep in the mix of our own annual planning for this next fiscal year. So, it's a bit early for us to go much deeper than what we have for you.", "Now, I would anticipate by the time we get into our November earnings release, we'll update our guidance at that point in time with everything we know, including how we finished out fiscal '12, and that point in time, I\u2019ll also give you a better sense of what we expect to happen in the coming year by segment. Now in terms of the potential Europe charges, and I want to emphasize potential. I called these out today to give you transparency to some deeper work that we're doing. It's work that's enabled by the fact that we are just say number of months now into leadership in Europe and this regional operating model that we've discussed with you before, it is really empowering much deeper local management, analytics and decision-making.", "We also now have several months into discontinuing economic climate in Europe that is just as the U.S. did several years ago, exposed our business to us in some different, more informative ways and helps us do this evaluation of the store portfolio. That work is underway. We don't know the answer yet. It's possible, possible that we could make some changes in equity and some changes in the store portfolio in this fourth quarter. The up to $20 million and that's an up to, it's not an estimate that it will be 20, but the up to $20 million that may occur in the fourth quarter is not included in my guidance for the fourth quarter.", "The potential carry-on of charges into next fiscal year and in my prepared comments I said that possibly an additional $10 million, and these are all just very broad ranges at this point in time, but possibly up to $10 million in fiscal '13 is roughly captured in the very big target range we have right now. So, '13, we're confident in the 15% to 20% earnings delivery, the fourth quarter because we were so specific on an EPS guidance range of $0.44 to $0.45 that if there are store closures to be had and charges associated with them, those would not be captured in that guidance already.", "Cliff, do you want to take the level question \u2026", "Cliff Burrows", "Yeah, I'll just talk about [level] question, and we saw leverage in our store operating expenses of about 70 basis points and really pleased with the progress we're making there. We are operating at record productivity levels in terms of sales labor. We continue to work hard using lean practices and all the work we've done over the last three years to bring this discipline around having labor at the right time and we'll continue our work and I see us having continued opportunity to leverage.", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner with Credit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I just want to follow-up on an answer from an earlier question, and Howard you had mentioned in talking about a swift and a key change at the end of June, and it happened quickly, you didn't have time to respond. I'm curious, in July we've had the launch of Refreshers. It\u2019s been a big push, lots of media, there's lots of buzz around at least where we are here. With that push of product innovation and marketing, has that helped in terms of a response to that change? How has that been received and what has that done to trend, if you don't mind talking about it?", "Howard Schultz", "The answer to the question is somewhat bifurcated. Refreshers is off to a very good start, both in our stores and in the 50,000 points of distribution and CPG, and we're very pleased with it and I think it's a big idea today and in the future. I just bifurcated because the traffic slowdown, the moderate traffic slowdown that we saw in June has somewhat continued in July. The difference in this quarter versus the last is that we had no time to respond. I can assure you that a response is coming in Q4 that we believe we\u2019ll address some of the issues and we have other levers that we can use. But the marketing that we've done for Refreshers has achieved its objective. I think the tactic to drive incremental traffic at multiple day-parts is a different approach than trying to build awareness and create trial and loyalty for Refreshers. That's why I said the answer is somewhat bifurcated.", "But I think the reason we've taken the guidance down to Q4 is just to take a very conservative approach to ensure the fact that if this continues, we're in a position to meet the expectations that we\u2019ve laid out today, but I want to assure everybody that there is a meeting going on every single morning at 7.00 AM in this building addressing yesterday's sales, diagnosing the issues, and then we're also, and I think this is important. You know I'm on the phone talking to many other heads of companies that are in the consumer retail space, and we're comparing notes about what's going on, and I think what we're all experiencing was very few exceptions Whole Foods being one of them, is that most \u2013 everyone one that we're talking to has almost a similar pattern that mirrors what we've just explained in June and July. So this is not a Starbucks issue. This is a macro problem. It's not an excuse we have to correct to quote on it, but we've got a fractured consumer confidence, and all of the things that you already know about, but we're confidence and we'll be able to navigate through it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Thanks. I have one question and then a follow-up. The first is on your license businesses internationally, one of the things that I noticed is that you actually got \u2013 pretty nice leverage on that other operating expenses line, pretty much across the Board and in some cases much better this quarter than the other quarter. I think a big piece of your strategy at least internationally in terms of margins has been the leveraging of that line as your units growth. So, I was just wondering if this \u2013 if we finally kind of hit that inflection point where we should start to see that really happening. And then my follow-up actually was on what you had said about obviously the step down in June and we haven't heard that from others. Did you see any regional variation within the country like just trying to figure out if there is any sense that there was any weather involved or anything that might \u2013 beyond just kind of that consumer really retrenched?", "Howard Schultz", "We don't talk about weather at Starbucks, I can tell you that. So, there has not been any regional differences that we can identify and the people that we've talked to on the phone I have had the same response. I know Troy want to answer your question, I mean Troy made a comment that I just want to make sure everyone stood, and that is we're going to accelerate the licensing of stores in Europe, and if you look at the progress that Michelle and her team have made just in the last 90 days, it's fairly significant. We have our board meeting in the U.K. this year coming up in another month, and we're going to really I think focus our attention with great specificity on the learnings we head in the U.S. to help Michelle, but I think we\u2019ve made great progress during the licensing acceleration is going to help that leverage line as well. Troy?", "Troy Alstead", "Yes Howard. Sara to your question and building-up on Howard's comments, licensing is a big part of our growth going forward, and as you know, we have historically built an infrastructure around the world ahead of the building of our store business. Very consciously often, occasionally, I would suggest that it's a little bit too far into that hurdle, but in the event as we have been addressing those issues, tightening up our capabilities, getting our model in the right places and are now prepared to accelerate that to us more meaningfully. We are beginning to see both \u2013 generally we would expect in the other operating expense line and also on our G&A line in the international segment to build and provide the leverage over time. It won't be the same leverage degree every single quarter, but certainly this trend line will be leveraged. It will begin to meaningfully see as we expand internationally and particularly focus on our licensed business.", "Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.", "Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Great, thank you very much. Just following-up on the EMEA side as you talk about the portfolio reevaluation and potentially some closures in Western Europe. If you could just take a step back perhaps just wondering whether you view it more as Starbucks specific or macro driven? It would seem like there's potential for both. But if it's Starbucks specific, I'm just wondering perhaps what learnings you would apply to your other regions of the world that might be similar? If it is macro, I'm not sure why perhaps you wouldn\u2019t fight through it and lead the charge in what seems like it would be a powerful long-term regional opportunity for you?", "Howard Schultz", "It's Howard again. Well first, I think we learned lots of lessons during the transformation of Starbucks in the U.S. business three, four years ago and those decisions looking back were based on making very tough choices about store closures and really rationalize the portfolio. And I think as we look today on the U.S. results, there is a direct correlation between closing those bad stores and taking your medicine. And looking back now, I think the strength and health of the U.S. portfolio is the strongest that it's been in decades.", "I think we want to take a similar approach in Europe, and I think we have an advantage. Michelle Gass who is now the President of EMEA was literally at my side during the transformation agenda and co-authored that strategy with me. So she's there and understands the game plan as well as anyone in the Company. Like any decision, there's always some self-induced mistakes that we have to [hold up to] and I think we made a few, but these are macro issues that have so much to do with things that are beyond our control.", "The austerity in Greece and Spain, the underlying issues outside of London and the U.K., the change in political leadership in France, all of these things have added to the lack of consumer confidence and we have to navigate through that and we're going to take advantage of it. I want to say something I think it is very important. We have great confidence that we are going to be able to turn Europe around. No one should doubt whatsoever that we're not going to be able to do this. It's not going to be a sprint. This is a long slog. The progress we made over the last 90 days is very encouraging, but we\u2019re going to be sitting at this table and we're going to be announcing with you just as we did in the U.S. a significant turnaround in Europe over time.", "Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.", "Thanks. First, I just want to clarify that the source of the earnings miss in the third quarter potentially for us is mostly the U.S. It would seem to me not Asia, not the general development businesses. They all seem to have improved or at least relative to my expectations. Secondly, one of the hallmarks \u2013 if I could just, one of the hallmarks of Starbucks has been your ability to manage expenses over time and I understand maybe the slowdown happened quickly, but I would still think you would have that ability through fourth quarter, particularly in the next year to have some management of discretionary expenses that would give you greater degree of confidence.", "So can you talk about what discretionary expenses are flexible? You've got a lot of growth initiatives going on. Are there some that you're maybe willing to sacrifice in the short-term if you believe that it would help you get through this more challenging times? Can you talk about flexibility over the next 12 months as well as the source of that earnings miss? Thanks.", "Troy Alstead", "Sure. John. You're right, in that the miss to our expectations in the third quarter was largely, but completely driven by surprising change in the growth trajectory in the month of June in the U.S. That was, as Howard mentioned earlier, happened quick enough that we just had the ability to respond very meaningfully.", "Now, let me add on to that statement, so by saying that even with that slowing traffic, we leveraged our P&L very significantly in that month of June and in the third quarter. We picked up 120 basis points of margin improvement in the U.S. in the third quarter and adding despite the fact that the sales trajectory maintained growth throughout the quarter, but just not as rapid growth as we moved into June. So, it's very important to distinguish. We're talking about very moderate changes here that moved us off of our expectation. So, it still put us in a position to drive the top line and drive the bottom line even faster in that business.", "Absolutely nothing to do in Q3 or Q4 of what we're seeing in China and Asia Pacific, which is a freight train for us, the key to rolling very powerfully, double-digit growth as we opened in new markets. The volumes are coming in as strong or in many cases higher than what they are in the Tier 1 cities. The profitability is very, very strong and maintaining our capabilities are deep, and we keep moving quite nicely.", "In Channel Development, 45% of revenue growth in the third quarter, probably not much else I need to say. We are extremely confident of the portfolio of products we have there and our ability to continue that moment as we move. So, it's been a modern consumer environment in the U.S. that we are adjusting both in our third quarter results and as we think about this fourth quarter.", "Now, to your point about expenses, and we've talked about this John in times past. One of the most important things we accomplished and learned and improved our abilities around coming out of the crisis of 2008 and 2009 was our ability to have visibility into and manage our P&L in a much, much more disciplined robust ways than ever before. Part of that through reporting and attention and focus, some of it through technology as we put in place things like new inventory management systems that gives us significantly more visibility into our inventory and enhanced all of that capability with our ability to manage that P&L, and we have every opportunity we believe to continue driving leverage, as Cliff said a short time ago, and manage appropriately our P&L as we build.", "I also want to be clear though that, there is nothing in the trends we saw in June or even in early in July here that changed our belief that we should be investing into our future going forward. It has caused us to give you some different perspective on what we think in the short-term here in Q4, but there is no change in our long-term trajectory, nothing that\u2019s leading us to think about anything other than the ability to continue to leverage our P&L as we move into 2013.", "John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.", "", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh with Stephens.", "Will Slabaugh \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Just wanted to ask quickly about the guidance one more time for fiscal 2013, just considering the rate of bottom line growth we're seeing now and what you're expecting in 4Q, just wondering what the puts and takes are from a sales down to a cost standpoint and considering you will have the coffee cost tailwind for next year. So, I guess my question more is just wondering what the offset is to the improving input cost for next year or if you're just being prudent with your guidance there for next year?", "Troy Alstead", "Well, I would suggest it's July and our fiscal year doesn\u2019t start until October. So some of this is just were well, well in advance of that new fiscal year beginning. We do expect, as you know, some commodity benefit coming our way next year. We also have some very conscious strategic, great return on investments coming in the next year, including our leadership conference. We're thinking our way through investments that might allow us to accelerate growth in our emerging markets, which are extremely valuable to us. We're thinking our way through investments perhaps in Europe that will help us accelerate the turnaround in that region, and move us towards a very, very healthy place in that part of the world over time. So, early in our planning and all those things are weighing through our thinking.", "With that said, everything we see in our trends and in our plans leads us to have some confidence in a 15% to 20% range for next year, which is quite a broad range at this point in time, and allows us as we get into the year and into the analyst conference in December, which we hope we'll see you all at to fine-tune that estimate and manage it and report to you a little more as we go throughout the year.", "Will Slabaugh \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jason West with Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Just a quick clarification question. Troy, can you just clarify what you would define as a mid-single digit range of comps, just what that would entail? And then on the China comments, I'm just a little bit confused, I saw you guys made some comments that things had returned to more of a sustainable run rate, but then you're pointing to pretty healthy trends, double-digit sort of level continuing, if you could just clarify how we should be thinking about the China comps going forward?", "Troy Alstead", "Sure. Mid-single digit is consciously a bit of a range only because it's not unusual that it may move around a little bit. Certainly, I view the 7% we turned in this quarter in the U.S. in mid-single digit range, 6% which was our global number but if that were in 5% or 6% certainly in the mid single-digit range. So, I can't be much more precise than that, but that's how we think about it and that's what we would expect over the long-term.", "Those aren\u2019t necessarily exact predictions for what we think happens this quarter or next year, but we do believe we have a healthy capability around innovation in our stores. We have continued opportunities to drive day-parts in our stores. We have continued opportunities through efficiencies and improving productivity in that busy morning day-parts. They put more volumes through there. We see no one in the sight that drive average unit volumes in our stores higher than they are today and we\u2019ll continue pursuing those opportunities, and we think we can do that steadily with a very healthy kind of mid-single digit comp growth over time.", "In China, without getting to a specific comp growth prediction, I would just suggest that we think we are very, very early days in our development of China. We're very excited to have just passed the important milestone of 600 stores in China recently and yet that is just a small number in the big scheme of what this market will represent for us in terms of store count over time, in terms of the other store channels and consumer products and food service that we expect to be able to develop more meaningfully as time progresses and in terms of our ability to drive AUVs across Asia and in China through healthy comp growth over time. So no specific guidance for you beyond the kind of ranges that we\u2019ve produced historically, but we think there's huge opportunity to keep driving that business forward.", "Howard Schultz", "One more question, please.", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco with Lazard.", "Matthew DiFrisco \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Thank you. Troy, my question I guess is a little bit more thinking about the business model going forward and during the last two years with all the coffee headwinds, you still put up 20% EPS and you had the high mid-single digit comps, and I guess the story was we're getting leaner and less comps and in a model where there's normalized commodities, we won't require as big of a comp to drive the earnings, especially when you see the high margin growth coming from the CPG business. I'm curious what is changing or how do we look at 2013 as far as you're giving guidance of mid-single digits whether that's four, five, six or seven?", "I would have thought in prior quarters you were setting up for a business model that probably could support even 20% or so EPS type growth, especially when you have the commodity tailwinds into 2013 as a net benefit to the overall cost. I'm just wondering, is this an innovation way down, is this a couple of years of building and investing or \u2013 and we're going to get to leverage eventually or is this is a model that requires always mid to high single-digit comps to get to the 15% to 20% model?", "Troy Alstead", "Matt, let me be clear. Absolutely nothing is changing in how we have built the model and navigated it and what we see coming in the next year. We've always said that coming out of the recovery period of 2008 and 2009, the bite of the apple in terms our ability to pull cost out of our structure to drive efficiency, those bites were naturally bigger in that first year and two and three and of course we took bigger step-ups in margin improvement in 2009 and in 2010 and 2011 and we expect even doing in 2012 for example.", "As we go forward from here, we have a long list of initiatives running efficiency around being leaner as we continue to go from here and better at what we do every day around driving the top line, about expanding day-parts. We have a longer list of things than we could ever get with any one particular quarter and it is that long list of efficiencies around the top line and managing the middle of P&L's that allow us to say with confidence that we have a long-term trajectory to drive leverage.", "We feel very confident of that and feel very good about that and I think we can sustainably drive that number forward and we'll have some commodity benefit coming our way in fiscal 2013. I would anticipate early days some additional commodity benefit coming to us in 2014, given the current commodity cycle as well. So, we think the combination of everything we're doing in the business and driving north of 10% revenue growth and 15% to 20% earnings growth, this is very, very healthy leverage point, and very healthy earnings growth for a company our size.", "Matthew DiFrisco \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Thank you very much.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "This concludes our third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings call.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Yearend 2012 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "Thank you, Ms. DeGrande you may begin your conference.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you, Rachel. Good afternoon, this is JoAnn DeGrande, Director of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and fiscals yearend 2012 earnings call. Opening the call today will be Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO, and he\u2019ll be joined by Michelle Gass, President of our Europe, Middle East and Africa Business and Troy Alstead our Chief Financial Officer. The three presidents of our other segments Cliff, John and Jeff are also on hand for Q&A.", "This conference will include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factors discussions in our filings with the SEC including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to the financial statements accompanying the earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures. The earnings release can be found on our website at starbucks.com under \u2018Investor Relations\u2019. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will also be available on our website.", "Before I turn the call over to Howard, let me cover a couple of additional items. First, given that this our yearend call we will extend it beyond 60 minutes as needed. And second, I\u2019d like to remind you that our Biennial Investor Conference will be held on December 5th in New York. We hope you\u2019ll join us in-person or participate via the webcast.", "With that, let me turn the call over to you, Howard.", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn, and good afternoon to everyone on today\u2019s call. Before we begin, as a lifelong New Yorker, I\u2019d like to express my heartfelt concern for the many millions of people impacted by this week\u2019s devastating hurricane. The images we have seen and stories we have heard are beyond heartbreaking. All of us at Starbucks are grateful to the thousands of first responders who are courageously and selflessly responding to this disaster, and our thoughts go out to those directly affected.", "I will now turn to the record fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 financial results Starbucks reported today. Q4 was an extraordinary quarter for Starbucks on almost every level. Record fourth quarter revenue of $3.4 billion, strong fourth quarter EPS of $0.46 which includes charges of $0.02 per share related to our store portfolio optimization initiatives in Europe, an increase in our total company operating margin to 15.4% and significant relevant innovation across our business segments and around the world.", "Starbucks solid Q4 performance has ideally positioned us to go into holiday with strong momentum supporting a powerful lineup of holiday beverages and product offerings and to further our commitment to continue growing sales and delivering increased profits to our shareholders in 2013 and in the future.", "Q4 also caps off a record full year in which our sales rose 14% to a record $13.3 billion, and our earnings rose 18% to a record $1.79 per share. What makes our performance during the quarter and the year even more remarkable is that both were achieved in the face of profound, continued economic uncertainty and challenged consumer environments in markets all around the world in which we operate and compete.", "Starbucks ability to deliver the results we did in Q4 and 2012 is a reflection of the strength of our business and brand, our deep connection to our growing universe of global customers and the correctness of our go-to-market strategies. As we were all reminded at our Leadership Conference last month in Houston, the key to our success are the 200,000 Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the green apron and deliver the Starbucks experience to our customers every day. To each of my partners, I want to say that I am humbled by your dedication and commitment, and that you have my deep personal gratitude and appreciation for all that you do.", "In fiscal 2012, Starbucks served nearly 3 billion customers who visited our stores, a statistic that testifies to the reach and breadth of our increasingly global brand and local relevance. And while the 18,000 stores in 61 countries we have today may sound like a large number, the fact is that the opportunity of Starbucks to grow our business around the world in a profitable, disciplined and deliberate fashion has never been greater or more exciting.", "Over the past 12 months, we added over 1,000 net new stores with two-thirds of those being outside the U.S. and we remodeled more than 2,000 stores globally. Our plans call for us to open an additional 1300 net new stores and to remodel roughly 2,000 more in fiscal 2013. We are well on our way to having more than 20,000 Starbucks stores on six continents by 2014. After more than 40 years Starbucks worldwide appeal remains undeniable.", "Starbucks is seeing strong and sustained growth in our core retail business across both the Americas, and China and Asia-Pacific regions where comp store sales growth reached 7% and 10% respectively.", "I\u2019d like to personally recognize Cliff Burrows, President of our Americas segment and John Culver, President of China, Asia-Pacific for their leadership in delivering the tremendous results they did in Q4. Particularly noteworthy is that Starbucks U.S. business revenue grew 9% and U.S. comps grew 7% in Q4. Reflecting a level of execution and intensity that is nothing short of fantastic given the softer than expected performance we saw in Q3.", "We accomplished our U.S. results by taking swift and decisive action to drive increased store traffic and improve operating efficiency, at the very first sign of the early summer slowing in traffic that we and many other retailers began to experience. And we continue to drive traffic in August by re-launching our popular and successful (inaudible) campaign and participating in a record-breaking, LivingSocial offer that was taken up by 1.5 million Starbucks customers, in believe it or not, in less than 24 hours. These initiatives also enabled us to generate incremental profitable sales, further communicate Starbucks\u2019 powerful value proposition and attract more customers to our U.S. stores for the September rollout of our full beverage lineup than ever before.", "As I mentioned earlier, the strong momentum we saw in Q4 has ideally positioned us as we head into Q1 of 2013 and the holiday season. Our traditional red cups and holiday beverages are beginning to appear in stores as a prelude to the official kickoff of holiday of our U.S. stores on November 13th. And I can tell you that we have the strongest and most exciting lineup of handcrafted holiday beverages and limited edition products in store for our customers than ever before.", "Also new this year, is Starbucks Christmas Blend Blonde Roast, a specially selected blend of Latin American and aged Sumatra beans that delivers a noticeably light and cheerful note. Christmas Blend Blonde Roast is a perfect complement to our fall \u2013 to our full lineup of holiday season offerings that extends both our Blonde Roast offerings and our best-selling Christmas Blend portfolio.", "But the big news for Starbucks this holiday season is the innovation and opportunity we have unleashed with Verismo. The only single-serve beverage system that delivers perfectly crafted Starbucks Caff\u00e8 Lattes and espresso beverages as well as brewed coffee from a single machine. If you haven\u2019t tried Verismo yet, I urge you to. The Verismo system produces the highest quality, best tasting, in-home, single-serve espresso and coffee beverages anywhere, bar none. And it\u2019s the first and only single-serve machine that uses pods made from real milk to deliver beverage quality and versatility meeting Starbucks exacting standards.", "In the eight months since we announced the Verismo system, we have successfully planned and executed the launch of Verismo in 6400 retail locations including premier specialty retailers like Williams-Sonoma in the U.S. where Verismo was chosen to be showcased on the cover of its holiday catalog. Harrods in the U.K., in Starbucks stores across the U.S. and Canada and through online e-commerce channels in 3 other countries.", "We are supporting Verismo with only the third national TV campaign in our 41-year history, elegantly through the unique Starbucks lens and in a way that introduces and celebrates Verismo system and elevates the Starbucks brand. With more than 10,000 Verismo demonstrations and sampling events taking place over the next several weeks, we expect Verismo\u2019s momentum to accelerate through the holiday season and continue into the feature.", "In addition to launching Verismo, our Channel Development team has continued to innovate in the premium single-serve category with other new product introductions across the portfolio, including Blonde Roast and our new successful Refreshers platform.", "As a result of these and other initiatives, our Channel Development business increased revenues by 50% in fiscal 2012 to $1.3 billion. We have expanded our global Channel Development presence now to 20 countries and we are targeting tens of thousands of new points of distribution, but I can assure you Jeff Hansberry and his team are just getting started.", "This month marks the first anniversary of the Starbucks K-Cup launch. And I\u2019m very pleased to report that in fiscal 2012, less than a full year of operation, we shipped nearly 500 million Starbucks K-Cups and have garnered a full 15.6% share of the premium single cup market, well above what people expected.", "VIA also continued to grow sales in fiscal 2012. VIA is now available in 14 countries and 80,000 points of global distribution. It grew nearly 50% in FY12 and garnered a 7% share of the premium single cup category in U.S. grocery channels in Q4. Together, our complimentary and carefully planned and executed K-Cup, VIA and Verismo product and go-to-market strategies provide Starbucks with the strongest and most complete comprehensive lineup of products and the definitive winning hand in the premium single cup category, and there will be more innovation to come.", "In 2012, we made significant headway against our ongoing plans to elevate and transform our food platform and bring authentic and delicious food to customers through the acquisition of La Boulange bakery. The fresh bakery products we are developing with the artists and bakers at La Boulange will rank among the very best bakery products you have ever tasted. We\u2019ve been testing new La Boulange offerings to a fantastic customer response and significant sales lift and now plan to rollout La Boulange products in 2,500 company-operated Starbucks stores across the U.S. beginning in the spring of 2013.", "Evolution Fresh, another of our emerging brands is also helping to expand and enhance our retail store and Channel Development operation and processes. Last month, we opened an Evolution Fresh store in San Francisco\u2019s Fillmore district our third Evolution Fresh location in the first one outside of Greater Seattle. Our fourth location will be opening in Seattle\u2019s University Village shopping center later this month.", "At the same time our Channel Development segment is continuing to significantly expand the availability of bottled Evolution Fresh juices through premium grocery channels in Starbucks stores. Evolution Fresh bottled juices are now available over 1,500 grocery locations including Whole Foods and Safeway and approximately 2,200 West Coast Starbucks stores, where we have seen a 100% lift over the juice product get replaced in our stores and we are on track to continue extending distribution of Evolution Fresh into more of our major U.S. company-operated markets throughout fiscal 2013.", "And Starbucks is making a big difference in the business in just a short time we have owned the company. Sales of Evolution Fresh bottled juice, through all channels in the latest quarter, were up 50% over sales in the same period of 2011 prior to our acquisition of the company. Our intention is to create another dynamic national brand with Evolution Fresh. And to meet the anticipated demand for Evolution Fresh products, we are adding a state-of-the-art juicery in Southern California in late 2013 that will have four to five times the production and packaging capability of the current Evolution Fresh facility.", "As I have noted in the past, Starbucks is embracing the seismic shifts in consumer behavior that are well underway. Let me now take a moment to share our progress and the investments we\u2019re making to continue our leadership in card, loyalty, social, digital and now mobile commerce, all of which will significantly enhance our customers experience with Starbucks.", "Our card and loyalty initiatives are continuing to drive great convenience and value for many customers. This has been a record year with nearly $3 billion loaded onto Starbucks Cards, with Starbucks Card transactions accounting for over 25% of U.S. store tender.", "The My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program has already amassed more than 10 million members, half of whom are active participants and have opted in to receive communications from us. As many of you know, we recently unveiled a number of enhancements to our loyalty program in the U.S. and Canada, including making rewards fully digital, making it easier for customers to earn free rewards, and including free food as part of the rewards option. As a result, we are already seeing record numbers of membership signups in the first few weeks of our new fiscal year, which really will bode well for fiscal and calendar 2013.", "The depth and breadth of our digital assets continues to grow with leadership positions and engagement across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and many other relevant medium. All this progress will now become even more relevant given the sea change in behavior and experience enabled by the ubiquity and personalization of mobile technologies.", "Our mobile payment platform has become the leading number one program for any consumer brand or retailer in North America, with now more than 2 million mobile payment transactions occurring every week and more than 100 million mobile payment transactions logged since the launch of Starbucks mobile payment app in January of last year.", "We believe the rapid adoption of mobile gives us an opportunity to create a unique and much deeper relationship with our customers directly and in the moment like no other consumer brand or retailer. We have the unprecedented ability to reach new customers, create awareness to new products, drive incremental transactions and explore new revenue streams in music and digital publishing.", "Recently, we have evaluated dozens of mobile payment solutions in companies, with an eye towards trying to find a company with a similar vision and approach to creating a mobile payment platform, where the customer experience is paramount. And that led us to Jack Dorsey and his team at Square.", "By partnering with Square and accepting their innovative Square\t Wallet mobile payment app in our stores, we are able to not only offer a complimentary mobile payment solution to our apps but we are also able to reduce our interchange fees for U.S. debit and credit card processing. We\u2019re looking forward to Starbucks customers being to use able the Square Wallet app to pay for purchases with their mobile phones in U.S. \u2013 in U.S. stores later this month.", "While we are proud of what we accomplished thus far in mobile, we plan to continue to push the envelope in the future by adding features and interactive activity in such areas as tipping, mobile ordering and personalization. And I can assure you, the best is yet to come in terms of the innovation that we are going to bring to the marketplace that creates separation, not only between us and other people in our space, but us and every other consumer and retail business.", "While I touched on the enormity of the global expansion opportunity for Starbucks that lies ahead, I would like to take a few moments to update you on a few of our recent global initiatives. Two weeks ago, I was in India to participate in the extraordinary opening of our flagship store in bustling Horniman Circle area of Mumbai. Our Horniman Circle store, without question, the most elegant Starbucks store we have created anywhere in the world, is a stunning two level experience that celebrates sensibility and respect to the beautiful tapestry of India\u2019s culture, while at the same time embracing Starbucks unique coffee heritage.", "In the days following the opening of the Horniman Circle store, we opened our second and third store in Mumbai. All three stores are exceeding our loftiest expectations. I cannot be more proud to enter the Indian market with the Tata Group, a global organization that shares many of the same values that Starbucks was founded on over 40 years ago. Starbucks opportunity in India is tremendous, and I\u2019m confident that India will evolve into one of Starbuck\u2019s five largest markets over time.", "We also continue to deepen our connection to consumers in China, where recently alongside Apple and Nike, Starbucks was named one of China\u2019s top 10 foreign brands. And just last week Starbucks received best employer in China recognition. These acknowledgements are testament to the dedication of our 15,000 Starbucks partners in China who deliver the Starbucks experience to the millions of customers visiting our 700 stores in Mainland China each week.", "Now despite recent economic reports pointing to a slowdown in China, it remains for us, one of the largest and fastest growing economies in the world, with rapidly increasing spending power of the fast-growing middleclass, and a market that continues to represent a major significant future retail growth opportunity for us. And Starbucks business remains extremely strong in China as evidenced by a 52% year-over-year increase in sales and double digit comps in China.", "We\u2019re building the China market deliberately and in a brand accretive way by making significant investments in our people, our systems and our operations. And the connection our partners are building with our customers in China gives me great confidence that we can ultimately bring the Starbucks experience to tens of millions of consumers through thousands of stores across the Mainland. In that regard I am pleased to report that we are on track to reach our near-term goal of having 1,500 stores in China by 2015, and that China will soon be our largest market outside of the U.S.", "Our journey across the China and Asia-Pacific regions continues as we look forward to opening our first store in Vietnam in early 2013.", "Finally, I recently attended the 10th anniversary celebration of Starbucks entry into Mexico meeting with inspiring partners and taking part in the opening of the market\u2019s first lead store. With 350 stores in Mexico, it is Starbucks third largest market within the Americas region. Mexico is also a fast growing market in Latin America. Together with our JV partner Alsea, we plan to open 150 net new stores in Mexico over the next three years.", "Before I introduce Michelle Gass, President of Starbucks EMEA, to share some of the developments and I\u2019m happy to say progress we are making in Europe and in the U.K., I want to tell you about the most important investment we will make all year in investment in our people.", "Last month 10,000 Starbucks partners gathered in Houston, Texas for our Leadership Conference. Just as with our transformational conference we held in New Orleans in 2008, Houston provided an extraordinary and inspiring three-day opportunity for us to connect our leaders to the heart of our company, enhance and refine their coffee expertise, inspire leadership skills and perfect the art exceeding customer expectations.", "The power and impact of the three days we spent together in Houston will reverberate throughout Starbucks this year and beyond, and enable us take our record breaking fourth quarter and 2012 performance to a completely new level in the future.", "It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michelle Gass.", "Michelle Gass", "Thank you Howard and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m delighted to be with you on the call today to update you on our EMEA business and the progress over the last year as our three-region operating model has taken hold. And as the EMEA leadership team and I have embarked on our transformation strategy or as we call it our renaissance plan.", "The region today operates across 36 countries in nearly 1,900 stores. Over the last year, we\u2019ve opened 111 net new stores including 10 company-owned and 101 licensed. We\u2019ve grown our geographic reach most notably with our recently announced partnership in Scandinavia with Umoe Group. We will open our first stores in the early part of 2013 in both Oslo and Stockholm with this terrific new partner.", "As you know, the EMEA region historically operates at significantly lower margins than the Americas and China, Asia-Pacific regions. There are several reasons for this. In our company-owned markets of U.K., Germany, France, Switzerland and Austria, our portfolio is dominated by high street shopping areas with occupancy cost 2 to 2.5 times that of the average occupancy costs in the U.S. as a percent of sales.", "This portfolio is also not as broad as in other Starbucks regions, where highly productive drive-throughs, small footprint stores and a strong presence of captive audience, licensors also diversify the retail footprint. All of these factors, coupled with the fragile state of the European economy and one of the fiercest competitive environments in the world makes for a robust exciting challenge.", "But on a positive note, these issues are largely within our control and we are taking actions. In the last year we had focused on driving results against three key strategies which are laying the foundation for a long-term profitable growth; first, increasing the Starbucks brand presence, health and relevancy across the region; second, unlocking the profitability of the existing base through focusing on top line growth and on operating cost; and third, positioning the region for growth primarily through licensing opportunities. I have great confidence that the region will achieve meaningful revenue and profit growth over the next five years and will deliver against our goal of mid-teens margin over time.", "Let me recap how we performed in the fourth quarter and later I will add some colors to the actions we are taking and the progress we are seeing. In Q4, revenues declined 2% versus the prior year driven by unfavorable currency exchange, but partially offset by 29% growth in revenue from licensed stores.", "Same-store sales were down 1% for the quarter driven largely by continued softness in Germany. And even though, the U.K. market delivered a slightly positive same-store increase for both the quarter and the year, this was dampened by continued weakness in consumer confidence and disappointing traffic levels experienced by most high street retailers throughout the London Olympics.", "Beyond our company-owned operations, our JV licensed business has shown continued strength with the Middle East, Turkey and Russia driving strong comp growth during the quarter and throughout the balance of FY 2012. The more encouraging news for the quarter and for the year is the progress in operating income. While EMEA has had an operating loss of $6.5 million and negative operating margin of 2.3% for the quarter, it included $11.5 million of charges related to the optimization of our store portfolio and $9.2 million of asset impairments for underperforming stores in the U.K., Germany and France.", "Excluding these charges, operating margin improved over the same period last year, as well as the second and third quarters of this year. We achieved this improvement through the efforts we have made on labor management, G&A, waste and a broad emphasis on cost control across all aspects of the business.", "The European portfolio optimization work involved in a number of factions, each focused on improving profitability and strengthening our P&L. These actions included a thorough review of the U.K. store portfolio, which resulted in negotiated lease termination charges as well as the transfer of airport stores in the U.K. to one of our existing channel licensing partners SSP. As a result, operating margin contracted by 410 basis points.", "As I mentioned, we realized $9.2 million of asset impairments for underperforming stores in the U.K., Germany and France. These expenses are a part of our normal quarterly review of underperforming stores and are not included in the portfolio optimization charges. They are reported in store operating expenses in our EMEA P&L and equate to a negative 320 basis points of margin impact in Q4.", "In the fourth quarter, we also transferred ownership of 17 stores in Ireland to an existing licensed partner Entertainment Enterprises. Ireland has always been a small market for us and it made more sense to leverage a partner with the local knowledge and capability in that country to drive profitability and growth. This resulted in a $4.9 million charge, which shows up in the other income line of the consolidated P&L outside of EMEA results.", "Looking forward there may be additional charges in the coming quarters, though likely to a much lesser extent than the Q4 as we have a handful of leases in which we\u2019re in the process of negotiating lease terminations. We know this is the right course of action to take and will leave us with a healthier, stronger portfolio upon which to build.", "As I mentioned earlier, our blueprint for change the EMEA renaissance plan has incorporated many lessons from the successful U.S. transformation of 2008 and 2009, that I had the privilege to be part of, while applying the lens of unique business and consumer challenges of Europe. We\u2019re leading the organization to deliver our goals, bring relevancy in margin expansion and unlocking the region\u2019s growth potential through a disciplined set of actions addressing coffee expertise, our people, driving frequency and loyalty and boldly telling our story.", "I\u2019ll share briefly with you some of the actions of the past 12 months, my first year leading the regional team. Coffee and people is at the core of our business and our brand and is a central long-term focus of this plan. Given how critical the role espresso plays in the lives of European consumers, we must deliver the best latte on the high street.", "In the last year we retrained all of our baristas, we introduced foam art and we made changes locally to respond to the needs of our customers, including changing the standard of our most popular drink in U.K. the Tall Latte to double the espresso. Response has been positive and we view this as a long-term investment to winning in the U.K. market.", "Equally, we have placed a significant focus on inspiring our people across the region and on shoring up the strength of the Starbucks\u2019 mission and culture. I have personally traveled now to more than two-thirds of the countries we operate in, conducting roundtables and open forums with our customers and our people, helping to shape our plans ahead. Driving our espresso focus through innovation, local relevancy and marketing will be the primary emphasis of the year ahead.", "We have also applied great focus to enhancing the customer relationship and building loyalty and frequency. The biggest move we made this year was introducing customers\u2019 names on cups, including Starbucks\u2019 style chalk name badges on our partners, enabling greater customer connections. We are also placing a great deal of emphasis on the customer environment marrying the latest design ethos of Starbucks with local edge.", "We renovated nearly 100 stores across the U.K. in-time for the Olympics. We opened now a globally acclaimed store in Amsterdam, two beautiful new stores in Madrid and Barcelona and are prepared to open an unbelievable flagship store in Kuwait with many more on the way.", "We are also addressing value in relative ways. We launched Starbucks Card and My Starbucks Rewards across most of our company-owned markets and some of our JV and licensed operations. We are implementing value offers in markets across the region and we are dramatically increasing our presence in social media to connect with our customers through these important channels.", "As I close out, I would be remiss not to acknowledge the recent media coverage surrounding our tax practices in the U.K. and across EMEA. For 14 years, Starbucks has been honored to serve our millions of customers across the region. We have never avoided paying taxes, and in fact adhere rigorously to the local accounting rules and tax laws everywhere we do business. And we have demonstrated our continued willingness to be open and transparent about our operations and their impact on taxable income.", "We look forward to continuing to clarify our position about our European tax position in the days and weeks to come. And I\u2019m so proud of our partners and how they have responded to customers and worked with one another throughout this period. They allowed us to stay close to the needs and the voice of our customers and helped to ensure that this is simply a point in time along the way that won\u2019t affect our momentum nor our progress towards the objectives within the renaissance plan.", "The work our partners are doing throughout the region, the passion they are bringing, the love they have for their customers and the Starbucks brand is at the core of the progress we are making. I have great confidence that, like the U.S. transformation, we are positioning this region for profitable long-term growth. Thank you.", "Now let me turn the call over to Troy.", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, Michelle, and good afternoon, everyone. As you heard from Howard and Michelle, we could not be more pleased with the trajectory of our business and the strong results we continue to deliver.", "2012 was a record year for Starbucks producing new highs in revenues, earnings, operating margin and return on capital. The company is stronger financially today than at any time in our history. We have a healthier pipeline of profitable growth opportunities in front of us now than ever before and we\u2019re deeper in terms of talent and capabilities to pursue those opportunities than we\u2019ve ever been.", "I will review the fourth quarter performance of our three other segments and the consolidated results for both the quarter and the year. Then I\u2019ll update you on our guidance for what we anticipate will be another strong year in fiscal 2013.", "In the Americas, the fourth quarter was an impressive demonstration of the capability of that team and of their focus and adaptability. Revenues grew 9% for the quarter to $2.5 billion with 7% comparable store sales growth. Especially noteworthy about this result is that it came on top of 10% comp growth last Q4, which was the best quarter we have had in more than five years.", "As we discussed on our last call, June and July were soft months in the U.S. Cliff Burrows and his team took quick action throughout the U.S. stores to turn the direction of our transaction growth. Our store partners continue to provide outstanding experiences to our customers every day. We reintroduced Treat Receipt in August and the annual fall favorite Pumpkin Spice in September. We\u2019ve provided customers value through the LivingSocial offer and we provided customers another reason to visit their Starbucks store with the launch of Refreshers. The result was a strong recovery of U.S. comp growth in the quarter to 7% with 5 percentage points of transaction growth.", "Americas operating income for the fourth quarter grew to $536 million, nearly 21% above last Q4. Strong sales and a high level of operating efficiency again provided increased leverage as we expanded operating margin by an outstanding 210 basis points to 21.4%. Store operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues dropped 70 basis points to 37.4%.", "Our experienced team of store managers adjusted labor schedules for the volatility we saw in the early summer period, which led to the right levels of store partners at the right time to deliver an outstanding Starbucks experience. Cost of sales and occupancy as a percent of revenues dropped 90 basis points over last Q4, due in part to increased sales leverage on our largely fixed occupancy costs.", "Now, in the China and Asia Pacific region, significant revenue growth continues to drive high margin returns. Revenues of $198 million were 23% higher than last Q4, boosted by incremental revenues from the new stores that opened in fiscal 2012 along with comparable store sales growth of 10%. The 10% comp growth was broad-based as our four company-operated markets China, Thailand, Singapore, and Australia, all posted healthy increases. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth in CAP and while some are lower than the growth rate for the past several quarters we\u2019ve been expecting that the extremely high comp growth of recent quarters would moderate over time. However, even with this expected slight moderation of comp growth, our business model in China remains outstanding and our growth acceleration plans are on track.", "In addition to the strength of comp growth in the region, new store performance remained strong. The CAP team opened 132 net new stores in Q4, the most ever in a single quarter for this region. Many of these were in China where we ended the year at 700 total stores. But the absolute number of new stores is not our primary focus in CAP. We remain acutely focused on and encouraged by the performance of those new stores.", "Stores opened in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 are delivering first year sales of approximately three times their investment, that is significantly above our targeted sales to investment ratio and speaks both to the high quality real estate our teams are securing, as well as the premium store experience we are designing and building.", "A higher pace of growth needs upfront investment to support it. This includes initial rent as we prepare the stores for business, higher labor for the stores first 8 to 10 weeks to set operational standards and understand the cadence of transactions and other growth-related expenses.", "These expenses were the largest contributor to the 340 basis point reduction in CAP operating margin in Q4 to 32.9%. A shift on our store portfolio composition was another contributor to the margin decline. As we have discussed in the past, we expect that as we continue our very profitable and rapid growth in China, we will shift the mix of stores in the region from predominantly licensed today to somewhat less licensed in the future. That business makeshift will have the impact of moderately reducing CAP segment margins over time and the shift did impact margins in the fourth quarter.", "In Channel Development, we completed a very active year with a strong fourth quarter. Revenues of $319 million grew by $76 million over last Q4. This increase of 32% was driven largely by sales of Starbucks and Tazo K-Cups, which have gained nearly a full point of market share in food, drug and mass channels since June. Channel Development achieved its significant milestone in Q4 as quarterly operating income exceeded $100 million for the first time ever. This represents an increase of 26% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter.", "Operating margin of 31.6% declined 155 basis points from last Q4. A shift in product mix as K-Cups grew their share of Channel Development revenue in the quarter combined with higher commodity costs totaled nearly 500 basis points of margin contractions. Partial offsetting by margin pressure was a shift in timing of marketing spend and increased sales leverage.", "Now I will review our consolidated results for the quarter. It was clearly the best fourth quarter Starbucks has ever delivered especially given the persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and the softness in June and July. Consolidated fourth quarter revenues grew 11% to a record $3.4 billion. Net increase was driven by 6% global profitable store sales growth, the 32% Channel Development growth I just discussed, contributions from stores opened over the past 12 months and continued strong performance from our global licensed operations.", "Our 6% global comp growth was driven by the strong results in the Americas and China/Asia-Pacific regions. Five percentage points of the growth came from transactions with one percentage point from average ticket. Two year comp growth of 15% in the quarter represents acceleration from both the second and third quarters. Consolidated operating income grew 16% to $520 million in the fourth quarter. Operating margin grew 60 basis points to 15.4% driven primarily by increased sales leverage. Commodity costs did not have a material impact on consolidated operating margin in the fourth quarter.", "Earnings per share of $0.46 grew 24% when excluding the non-routine gains in last Q4. As a reminder those non-routine gains resulted from the acquisition of the remaining equity in our Switzerland and Austria markets and the sale of corporate real estate here in Seattle.", "The $0.46 EPS of this Q4 includes the $0.02 impact of two items; the $11.5 million store portfolio optimization in the EMEA P&L and the $4.9 million related to the licensing of Ireland that hit our consolidated P&L. The store closures and ownership changes are a key element towards strengthening the EMEA business and represent an important step in achieving our longer-term goal in that region.", "For the full fiscal year of 2012, the results were equally strong. Total net revenues grew 14% to a record $13.3 billion with 7% global comp growth and 50% growth in Channel Development. The 7% comps were driven by a 6% increase in transactions as we continue to see new customers in our stores while also serving the same customers more frequently. In fact, we are proud to deliver such meaningful growth without relying on significant price increases as by and large we absorbed this spike in coffee costs this year through disciplined cost management and a relentless focus on providing experiences in our stores that encourage frequent customer visits.", "We also set records for both operating income and operating margin at $2.0 billion and 15.0%, respectively. The operating margin expansion of 50 basis points over 2011\u2019s non-GAAP result was accomplished despite a negative 160 basis point impact or $214 million due to higher commodity costs in fiscal 2012.", "Throughout the year, our operating teams did an extraordinary job of improving efficiency and tightening managing costs, which drove leverage on our strong sales and offset the impact of historically high coffee costs.", "The result of the revenue growth and margin expansion was record earnings per share, which for the full year reached to $1.79 that equates to 18% growth over last year\u2019s non-GAAP EPS of $1.52 per share, falling squarely within our stated long-term guidance of 15% to 20% annual EPS growth.", "We opened 1,063 net new stores across the globe in fiscal 2012. 665 of those were licensed stores, which demonstrates the continued strength of the many valuable licensed partnerships we have around the world, and then nearly, 400 company-operated stores we opened in 2012 are exceeding our first year sales projections indicating another class of stores that will contribute to long-term sustainable growth.", "The strength of our business results in significant cash generation, allowing us to invest in our existing portfolio of stores and in future multi-channel growth opportunities while also increasing the cash return to shareholders.", "In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares of stock. Additionally, today, we announced that our Board has approved a 24% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.21 per share. I will now give you an update to the initial fiscal 2013 outlook that I provided on last quarter\u2019s call.", "We continue to target revenue growth in the range of 10% to 13%, driven by mid-single digit comp growth of approximately 1,300 net new stores and continued strength in channel development. The 1,300 net new stores represent an increase over what I provided last quarter, driven by further acceleration in China and Asia Pacific. We now expect CAP to open 600 net new stores in fiscal 2013, with roughly 50% of those been licensed.", "China will account for slightly more than one half of CAP new stores. Our America\u2019s estimate of 600 net new stores and our EMEA estimate of 100 net new stores are unchanged.", "Capital expenditures are now expected to be near $1.2 billion in fiscal 2013. This increase reflects the growth in new stores, continued focus on renovations as well as investment in additional manufacturing capacity.", "Full year consolidated operating margin is now expected to grow by approximately 100 basis points over fiscal 2012, as we continue to drive leverage. I will provide operating segment margin targets at our Investor Conference in early December.", "Given the strength of our global business, the momentum we carry into 2013 and the deep pipeline of profitable growth initiatives, we are raising our fiscal 2013 earnings per share target to a range of $2.06 to $2.15. This represents 15% to 20% growth of our fiscal 2012.", "While we expect each quarter to fall within that 15% to 20% growth range, our first quarter EPS is expected to come in at the low end of that range. This is due to investments unique to the first quarter, including our leadership conference which was held in early October and cost approximately $30 million and the launch of Verismo.", "We are positioning Verismo for a significant impact in the years ahead and are approaching that as a major platform launch with significant spend in marketing, sampling and store labor. As a result, we expect that Verismo will produce a net loss of approximately $30 million in the first quarter and a total net loss of $30 million for the full year. The launch of Verismo this quarter is just a beginning. We will build and expand the Verismo platform in order to pursue the multi-billion dollar global opportunity.", "And finally, we continue to expect a net benefit of approximately $100 million of $0.09 per share in fiscal 2013 due to favorable commodity costs, which is included in our targets. We believe that impact will be spread evenly throughout the year at approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter.", "2012 was a phenomenal year for Starbucks by every measure. We strengthened our operational muscle with record productivity in the U.S. and enhanced capabilities around the world. We strengthened our tie to our loyal customers, with enhancements that provide significant rewards through our loyalty program. We strengthened our global portfolio by opening profitable new stores, by closing unprofitable stores and by filling the small markets to local licensees.", "We strengthened our product line up with significant innovation around refreshment, health involvements, at home coffee, and a huge opportunity in food. We drove strong financial results reaching records for revenues, earnings, operating margin and return on capital and we increased cash returned to shareholders with prudent share repurchases and a growing dividend.", "We are excited to leverage these strengths and momentum in 2013 in ways that greatly reward our customers, our partners and our shareholders. And we\u2019re confident in our outlook of continued, strong, profitable global growth in the year ahead.", "With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Rachel?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thanks very much. I wanted to just go back to the U.S. and the same-store sales that you reported and what the turning point was? We all assumed you entered the quarter in July maybe comping 5%-ish, but you ended at 7%, so it implies there was a fairly dramatic acceleration. So, was that a consistent acceleration to the quarter, was there a bigger response say to the Treat Receipt?", "And just \u2013 and just in general, what other elements do you think drove it, because what you did during the quarter was impressive from a promotional standpoint or from an execution standpoint, but I didn\u2019t think any of those stood out my mind as being events that would drive comp acceleration to this magnitude, so maybe any other color around that would be helpful? Thanks.", "Troy Alstead", "Sure, John, thanks for your question. Let me start just briefly and then I\u2019ll ask Cliff Burrows, the President of our Americas business to speak more specifically about the actions in the quarter and what the impact of some of those things were.", "Yes, you\u2019re right, the July, similar to June and as we discussed at our last earnings call in late July, was a soft month for us. Soft, still growing in traffic, still total comp growth growing, but softer than we had been trending earlier in the spring.", "As we progressed through August and September, we saw a very, very significant recovery in our same-store sales and absolutely exited the quarter in a much healthier place than where we entered the quarter.", "With that, I\u2019ll have Cliff speak a little bit more specifically to some of the actions we took.", "Cliff Burrows", "Thanks, Troy. Thanks, John. It really was an intense focus on the operations of our stores and our partners did an amazing job just getting about on daily work and that was focusing on the customers we had in front of us. Treat Receipt was well received by both our partners because they\u2019re familiar with it and our customers because it was an all-favorite coming back. Between Treat Receipt and LivingSocial, I\u2019d say that accounted for about 1% comp growth in the period where we run it and we also in this period launched our Refreshers platform, which was in there in handcrafted and in cans in our stores, and all of that gathered a momentum and gave us good pace for the future. So, it really was a great focus on the business and really closed with the way everybody responded.", "Troy Alstead", "John I\u2019d just add one thing that the public doesn\u2019t see directly and that is the use of all of the social media channels that we were able to leverage. Starbucks is at any given month a leading brand on Facebook and Twitter. As a result of that, we were able to leverage a level of engagement with a large number of customers, millions of Starbucks fans and customers and direct them to the store in ways that really reduced traditional marketing spend. And I think between that the operations that Cliff talked about, the effectiveness of Trade Receipt and LivingSocial, we were in a position and then towards the end of the quarter, we began to have a great result with Pumpkin Spice Latte, which got off to a fantastic start despite the fact that it\u2019s been year-over-year. All of those things bode very well for the quarter; and as we said, a stunning turnaround from Q3.", "John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco from Lazard. Your line is now open.", "Matt DiFrisco \u2013 Lazard", "Thank you. I just wondered if you can give us a little color on sort of those remodels. I think you touched on about a little over 2,000. What you\u2019re seeing as far as volumes afterwards and the key initiatives to those remodels, I guess, is it longer term for setting up for better products and more products to sell or is there also sort of a near term added benefit with any sort of improvement on throughput during those high peak times, because your traffic number looks extremely strong and I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s a reflection in part due to some throughput initiatives?", "Troy Alstead", "Matt, let me start to address it, but I\u2019m also going to ask Cliff to get into a few more specifics. We have, as you said, a long list of major and minor and everything in between remodels over the past year. And as Howard mentioned, I think 2,000 remodels planned and we expect to be on a pace of level like that for some time.", "Now I would point out that somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,000 remodels, a smaller number, somewhere in the mid-100s are more major significant type of things that might involve a very substantial change or the expansion of a store, the balance of them may involve more minor changes that aren\u2019t just significant remodel of the store. So, it\u2019s a varying degree of impact both on the store itself and on the results to come out of it.", "Needless to say, Cliff will go into more specifics, but as we do particularly those major remodels on that individual store, we see a very, very, very significant increase in comp growth in that store when we opened.", "Howard Schultz", "The store in Spring Street in SOHO is the prime example of that \u2013 of a significant remodel and as a result of that significant return on investment and an enhanced customer experience. I just mentioned that because it\u2019s in New York.", "Troy Alstead", "Yeah.", "Cliff Burrows", "Matt, hi, it\u2019s Cliff. The 2,000 you mentioned is obviously a global number approaching the 1,700 in the U.S. last year and then you fit into those categories that Troy said. And we are focusing on each refurbishment to make sure we treat it like a new store and equip it to deal with the changing customer base and changing demand around peak and at different times of the day. We\u2019re looking at it to enhance not only the experience, the seating, the flow and introducing innovation like clover and each time we innovate we bring in clover and that really helps us in many ways, helps us to build the relevance with our customers build our coffee authority and that intimacy and just keep raising the conversation around coffee and the level of our execution.", "And so there isn\u2019t a sort of a general number I\u2019d give you as the benefit, because each one of them is unique and each one of them we try and do the best thing for our partners in terms of the work environment and our customers in terms of the experience and we\u2019ll do a similar number in the coming year in the U.S.", "Matt DiFrisco \u2013 Lazard", "Thank you. I just had one follow-up also. I guess you mentioned a little bit about the Evolution Fresh, the 2,200 West Coast stores, a 100% lift in that. Was that also \u2013 I\u2019m not familiar, I haven\u2019t gone to one of those stores \u2013 is that similar to how you did the Refreshers as far as have you combined that with putting the ready-to-drink product out with also any sort of assortment of handcrafted drinks with Evolution Fresh yet?", "Troy Alstead", "If I talk about Evolution Fresh in U.S. Starbucks stores, it is bottled beverages only. We have a range of six of cold-pressed beverages and it ranges from orange juice, which is the most familiar and the best-seller and it goes through to whether it\u2019s sweet drinks or essential vegetables, it\u2019s a wide range.", "It supports our health and wellness platform and the increase that Howard refers to is a mixture of both ticket and volume, but it has been well-received in every single market. Future innovation will come from our learnings from Evolution Fresh stores, of which we opened the latest one in Fillmore Street last weekend down in San Francisco and as had a fantastic reception locally.", "Matt DiFrisco \u2013 Lazard", "Excellent. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Jeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclays", "Thank you very much. Just I guess a two-part question as we look to CAP and I guess specifically to China. One, just from a unit perspective, it seems like there is obviously an acceleration in openings, I know it\u2019s 300-plus in fiscal 2013, considering you only have 700 in total, obviously that\u2019s a pretty sizable up tick. I\u2019m just wondering, if you can give some color around real estate availability, whether you\u2019re seeing increased competition? We\u2019ve heard from others that perhaps the competitive environment to get these sites is going up and that\u2019s where the cost is going up with it. So, I\u2019m just wondering, if you could talk from a real estate perspective?", "And then the other piece relates to the other driver of top line, which would be comp, and you mentioned I guess the 10% plus comp, which I guess, an impressive string of 11 straight quarters of that double-digit. I\u2019m just wondering whether you view like you said the deceleration \u2013 like how do you decipher between the deceleration due to the compares versus the deceleration due to what you kind of acknowledge was a macro slowdown in China? Thanks.", "Howard Schultz", "John?", "John Culver", "Yeah. Hi, Jeffrey, this is John Culver. First off, the opportunity that we have in China is enormous and we continue to see very strong acceptance of the Starbucks brand and when we\u2019re opening our new stores, we\u2019re opening both in our existing cities as well as new cities. We now are in 52 cities across the country. We opened 12 new cities this past year. And as Troy touched on, we\u2019re seeing a three times sales to investment ratio over the last two years.", "So all indications for us is that China represents right now the most immediate and fastest retail growth opportunity that the company has in front of us, and with that what we\u2019re doing are making significant investments around our people in terms of ramping up the investment and the hiring and training of people to staff the new stores as well as investment in infrastructure from a supply chain and IT perspective. We\u2019ve also localized our design resource to help enable speed into the market of opening our new stores and then also invested heavily in research and development so that we can have locally relevant products that match the flavor profiles that our Chinese consumers want.", "In terms of the real estate that we\u2019re seeing, we are seeing an abundance of available real estate and we\u2019ve invested in local teams in the major provinces in the major cities to go out and to capture that real estate opportunity and what we\u2019re seeing is that we\u2019ve been very well-received in the new cities that we\u2019re in, we are going into. Consumer response, we\u2019re seeing lines out the door and the new stores in these new cities are exceeding our expectations. So we\u2019re very optimistic and very bullish on the opportunity. We\u2019re going to stay very focused and very disciplined in the investments and monitoring the performance of our new stores and our existing stores and we\u2019re going to continue to drive relevant innovation into the stores so that we can continue to sustain the growth.", "And as Troy pointed out in his comments also, there is a rebalancing that\u2019s taking place that as we continue to accelerate the new store growth, more of our sales growth is going to come from new stores versus comparable sales growth. So you\u2019re going to see a rebalancing of the portfolio and as part of that more company-owned stores versus licensed stores which is going to have a slight impact on margin over time.", "Jeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclays", "Is it \u2013 just to follow up, are you seeing any sign just from the macro perspective versus the compares whether or not you think consumer shifting to lower-priced items or any kind of mix \u2013 anything concerning versus just compare driven slowdown in comp?", "John Culver", "I haven\u2019t seen anything that\u2019s concerning to me at this point in time. I mean we monitor this very closely, obviously are aware of others \u2013 people\u2019s challenges in China, but for us, we\u2019re continuing to make the investments. We\u2019re taking a long-term view and we\u2019re pushing forward.", "Troy Alstead", "And Jeff, I would also just add to that that we are continuing to grow traffic in China, we\u2019re continuing to grow ticket in China, we\u2019re growing healthily across all day parts and the two-year comp growth is remaining very, very, very strong if you compare that over the last several quarters. I think that speaks to the fact that, yes, we\u2019re up against tougher compares. It wasn\u2019t all that long ago just a couple of years ago, where average unit volumes in our business in China were roughly a third U.S. levels. They are now well greater than half U.S. levels and catching up and by the way that comes at a point in time when average unit volumes in the U.S. have been growing and are at all-time record levels here in the U.S. and yet China has been growing quickly. So we don\u2019t see any concerns about growing volumes whatsoever.", "Howard Schultz", "John?", "John Culver", "Hey, Jeff, just one other thing I\u2019d like to also comment on in terms of real estate, one of the things that we did earlier this year is host the first ever landlord real estate conference in Summit where we brought in all the major owners of key developments across China. And Howard and I and Arthur Rubinfeld had the opportunity to sit and address them and talk about the investments we\u2019re going to make in China from a growth perspective, talk to them and share new designs and really start to build the unique partnerships that we wanted to go after with these key landlords and that is paying huge dividends for us.", "Jeff Bernstein \u2013 Barclays", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.", "Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the top-line in the U.S. obviously again very impressive. I just \u2013 I\u2019m wondering as you look forward and it\u2019s also equally encouraging that you\u2019re sticking to the sort of mid-single digit comp guidance overall. If you could talk a little bit about", "A, what your expectations are for the demand environment given that I don\u2019t think the overall environment got better just you seem to reaccelerate? And, B, if you can talk a little bit about in terms of contributions, is it more from new products, is it from Verismo, is it from things like \u2013 more like the Treat Receipt more \u2013 being a little bit more aggressive on social media that kind of thing? Just so we have some comfort in the bottoms-up driver of the comps?", "Howard Schultz", "This is Howard. I\u2019ll start, I think it\u2019s very interesting and multidimensional question. If you look at the last few years, there is no question that the economic environment in the U.S. has been very challenging, fragile, and depending on the region, very difficult at times. I would \u2013 I\u2019m not an economist, but I would say that the consumer environment is somewhat bifurcated and has been for a couple of years.", "And I wouldn\u2019t describe Starbucks literally as a luxury brand, but I think we occupy a very unique space that is the premium brand and luxury brand within our space. At the same time, we are still very much an affordable luxury by not only people who are at the high-end of luxury consumers, but people who can afford Starbucks in all walks of life.", "In addition to that, I think we have been able as evidenced by Q4 and I think this is really important and highly relevant. We\u2019ve been able to thread the needle to maintain and preserve and enhance our premium position as a premium brand, while at the same time, developing, offering and creating value propositions for our customers that in no way dilute the equity of the brand, but reward our customers by, in a sense, putting our feet in their shoes and developing value for them.", "Having said all that, I think we are highly confident that despite any turn in the current economy that we can anticipate that we have the tools, the resources and most importantly, the power in the marketplace to navigate through this by what we\u2019ve been able to learn and the muscle memory that is inside the DNA of the company since transforming the company in 2008.", "I do think the burden of proof is on companies and consumer brands to recognize there is a seismic change in consumer behavior, as I alluded to in my remarks, as a result of social and digital media and the emergence of mobile commerce and mobile payments. But we are in the most desirable position because of the investments we\u2019ve made over the last few years to not only be the leader in the space, but now have the tools, the resources and the capability to leverage those channels and means in a way that is almost unparallel in the marketplace.", "So the short answer is, we are optimistic that we \u2013 and we\u2019re confident that we can continue to navigate through changes in the economy and we\u2019ve done it now year-over-year and I think turn in Q4 is not only stunning but gives us great confidence as we head into fall holiday in 2013.", "Cliff Burrows", "Yeah, if I can answer, so the other piece I think is about our people. We have invested greatly in our managers and our leadership and giving the tools to our partners to do their work and I think that has really helped us in terms of the amount of time we have to connect with customers, to improve the quality of the customer experience and the relationships we form. I think there\u2019s nothing better to support that than the fact we have 3 million Gold Card members as part of our My Starbucks Rewards and that just gives this dialogue and immediate feedback and such a richness.", "And I think just to give you a little bit of additional (inaudible), we\u2019ve seen strong growth across the whole of the U.S. in August and September, and if I look back on the year as a whole, I\u2019d also say that. And the work we\u2019ve been doing around day parts, whether that is building capacity at peak or enhancing the food offer around other day parts, we have seen growth on all day parts. So we continue to grow at peak in the morning, but also at lunch, afternoons and now into the evenings. And I think that is what gives us the confidence about both the opportunity to grow more stores in the U.S. and to continue to grow average unit volumes by spending on day parts and our ability to deal with peak capacity. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler from CLSA. Your line is now open.", "Diane Geissler \u2013 CLSA", "Hello, can you hear me okay?", "Howard Schultz", "Yes.", "Cliff Burrows", "Yes.", "Diane Geissler \u2013 CLSA", "I wanted to ask if you\u2019ve seen any changes in the competitive dynamics within the CPG channel given the expiration of the patents on the K-Cups, have you seen any movement there from additional SKUs?", "Troy Alstead", "Diane, we\u2019ll have to introduce Jeff Hansberry, who is on the call and as you know, President of our Channel Development business and he will take that question.", "Jeff Hansberry", "Hi, Diane, thanks for your question. Yes, we have. We have seen the introduction of some private label offerings in the K-Cup space that have been previously announced that I think we\u2019re all aware of and we\u2019re starting to see some of those begin to show up on retail shelves. We have not seen a significant impact though to retail pricing or the competitive space. And in fact, we continue to see strong demand for Starbucks K-Cups from our customers.", "Howard Schultz", "Next question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thank you. I just wanted to ask a question, thinking about all the various initiatives that launched this quarter from Treat Receipt, LivingSocial a number of different loyalty based programs. There was a lot of product news, marketing news and other promotion news in general, some of which was really unique and kind of differentiated. As you enter a period of deflation in 2013 and maybe beyond, does this free you up to say do a little bit more of this activity than maybe you used to? Is Q4 somewhat of the new base level, I mean we\u2019ve seen product in other news working very nicely across the sector and again does this deflation give you an opportunity to say, ramp that effort from maybe what we\u2019ve seen historically? Thanks.", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you for the question. This is Howard. I respectfully say, no. I think all of us at Starbucks are deeply committed to preserving and enhancing the equity of the Starbucks brand. And as a result of that, we want to be extremely disciplined and thoughtful about how, when and with who we might do things that create an offer, whether it\u2019s Treat Receipt that we did on our own or the relationship we developed with LivingSocial.", "I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re going to see Starbucks go on sale or anything like that. I do think that we have to be ultra-sensitive to the economic issues and the pressure on the consumer, but I think we\u2019ve demonstrated over 41 years that the best anecdote for us is the experience we create in our stores, the quality of the coffee and the level of innovation.", "I think what we haven\u2019t talked about today is because it isn\u2019t appropriate is the pipeline of products categories and innovation that we have in the near and long-term future, which I think is the strongest pipeline in the history of the company. We\u2019ve taken great steps to recognize that the status quo in our business or any business isn\u2019t going to be good enough, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go down the road of discounting Starbucks. We\u2019re doing things on an ongoing basis that was highly selective at the time and we\u2019re not going to do that on a consistent basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "You guys touched a little bit on the food program that you\u2019re working to roll out with the upgrades there with the La Boulange product line. If you could talk a little bit about what you\u2019ve seen in the West Coast markets where you\u2019ve tested that, if you have any details or anecdotes or figures you could share on that and sort of what it looks like from a customer perspective when you make those changes?", "Cliff Burrows", "Thank you, Jason, it\u2019s Cliff. It is very early days and we have had 10 stores open in San Francisco where we have been developing and testing a specific line of pastries and muffins and the like for the morning business, we\u2019re really encouraged by that, and that\u2019s really been the very early steps.", "This week and next week we launch in San Jose and that would be our first time outside of the San Francisco market and that will give us new learnings. The reaction from our partners in our stores about the quality of the food and the enhanced pride they\u2019ve got to share those products with the customers, the taste is absolutely fantastic and the reaction from customers in the stores we have served it so far has been fantastic. I think we\u2019ll be in a much better position after the San Jose launch to give a bit of color, a bit of a flavor and more detail of our rollout plans at the Analyst Conference in early December in New York. So, nothing specific to share, but we\u2019ve seen a great reaction so far.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Michael Kelter \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I had a few margin questions, I guess for Troy. The first is you raised your operating margin guidance for 2013 from 50 basis points to 100 basis points initially to a 100 basis points now. And I wanted to understand the puts and takes there and why you felt comfortable taking the guidance up before the year even started? And secondly, I hear you talk about your visibility into 2014 given coffee cost remain in the $1.60 range, which as I understand it is well below your lock cost for 2013?", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks Michael. Yeah, let me speak to the last part first. We have been doing some buying \u2013 early buying into fiscal 2014 on our coffee needs. We\u2019re not very far into 2014 yet, but we\u2019re going down that path a little bit and we\u2019ll talk about that in a bit more detail at the conference in December. Suffice to say though, as we\u2019ve talked about before, the early read and what we can see is that 2014 is likely to benefit from reduced coffee costs once again. The order of magnitude is too early to tell, but what I point out is that we will exit the year of 2013 with coffee costs significantly lower through our P&L than we entered the year of 2013 coming through our P&L. But again, that\u2019s a comment given what we see today, with not very much of 2014 locked at this point in time.", "Now, in terms of margins we\u2019ve raised it today to the 100 basis points of improvement given the number of things that we\u2019ve seen as we come through the fourth quarter, the momentum we have both on the top line as well as the completion of the operating plans that we put together annually in the summer, prior to the start of the new fiscal year.", "And that\u2019s given us confidence given again both the growth we see around the world, the investments that we know we need to make in new initiatives and the growth opportunities we have in the future and the margin improvement opportunities we have all throughout the P&L; in supply chain, in operations management, in leverage of G&A, an improvement in Europe, which we are expecting based on, as you heard from Michelle, some of the many changes that her and her team have been tackling over there. So, I would expect margin improvement really in a number of places in our business and it\u2019s all of that I have visibility into, that\u2019s given me the confidence in the improvement I talked about both in terms of operating margin as well as earnings growth in the year ahead.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from UBS. Your line is now open.", "David Palmer \u2013 UBS", "Hi. Congrats on the quarter and the year. I know it\u2019s early days on the Verismo, but what are some of the feedback you are getting from retailers and your own store managers on the machine? The strengths and weaknesses versus other products that are out there in the single-serve market?", "Howard Schultz", "Jeff, you want to start.", "Jeff Hansberry", "Sure. Hi David, it\u2019s Jeff Hansberry. We\u2019re very encouraged on the Verismo System. For us it\u2019s a first in a number of ways. It\u2019s the first system that makes Starbucks quality lattes, espresso and brewed coffee all from one machine. We get natural milk pods that are made from real milk, that deliver a great latte and for the first ever we\u2019re able to have Starbucks partners, our baristas actually go out and meet with customers in specialty retail stores and tell the story of Verismo and tell the story of Starbucks.", "So, we\u2019re off to a very good start. Our shipments are in line with our expectations. But importantly, with a new system like this we are listening very closely to our customer feedback and the majority of feedback is very positive. We are listening for customer opportunities for improvement and we\u2019ll continue to do so.", "Howard Schultz", "Jeff, you want to just address the attachment on pods that we\u2019re seeing?", "John Culver Well, it\u2019s still very early. We\u2019re only \u2013 we only got a months\u2019 worth of data, but at purchase we\u2019re seeing significant multiples of purchases of pods, actually well ahead of our expectations.", "Howard Schultz", "The other thing I would add and I think this is important and Troy alluded to this in his remarks. The launch of Verismo is the launch of a product, but behind the scenes it is the launch of a platform and a deep strategic commitment that we have to the single-serve category domestically and globally. If you look around the world at what Espresso has done building a multibillion dollar business, what Keurig and Green Mountain have done and then the nascent space that we believe exists in Asia and our brand position. This is a global long-term multibillion dollar business and we are just getting started. Verismo is just the beginning.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thank you very much. A question on Europe, specifically if I may, there was a little bit of re-franchising activity I guess in Ireland, specifically you pointed out. Ad I just wanted to get the sense of how much of an opportunity that may exist for existing company store base, whether it is in Switzerland or France or the U.K. or Germany, but have you to perceive more of an asset-like model on those markets and whether they\u2019d be any constrains to earning pure company store, as well as still maintaining your footprint in any of the major markets where you currently are?", "Michelle Gass", "Hi, John, it\u2019s Michelle. Thanks for the question. U.K. is the central part of our strategy going forward, which is really a sea change in our opening plans. We see the licensing and franchising opportunity as tremendous. And it does a couple of things. First of all, it gives us access to places probably on the high street, which as I mentioned in the call earlier is largely where we are penetrated. And we have not only agreed with our existing great partners like SSP or Autogrill to have a more accelerated plan, but also bringing in new partners like for example in the U.K. Euro Garages, which is going to help us and compliment with us our plans to expand into hundreds of drive-thrus across the region over the next few years.", "We see absolutely tremendous opportunity but it\u2019s largely about the new growth and our new growth will be dominated by licensing. We also are actively looking at the franchising opportunity and we have put that strategy in place in the U.K. and we are looking to extend that strategy across Continental Europe. And then as it relates to our existing base, we\u2019ll look at smart opportunities that make sense for the business then for our customers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citi. Your line is now open.", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citi", "Great, thanks. Maybe if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of the coffee consumer, as well as the competitive landscape in Europe, and maybe any changes that you\u2019ve seen over the last quarter or two?", "Michelle Gass", "Yes. Thank you for the question. As I said earlier we face tremendous competition not only with a, I\u2019ll call them bigger chains but also with many small operators across the region. As I said I visited now many, many markets throughout my first year and what I will tell you consistently across both our customer and our partner feedback is what the customer is looking for is the Starbucks experience. And that \u2013 what we bring is unique product whether it\u2019s our Espresso, our Frappuccino, importantly the environment, free WiFi all of which are assets and we\u2019re also very focused on building like we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. our digital platform, our service rewards platforms etcetera.", "So I would say that there hasn\u2019t been tremendous change for say over the year, but we are getting a lot closer to the customer and navigating in ways to bring local relevancy and that relates to, as I mentioned, focusing on espresso, bringing a new level of innovation in that category, and I\u2019ll be speaking to that when we\u2019re together in December and that\u2019s not only with products but in delivery systems. It\u2019s also around our food and importantly our environment. We\u2019ve now built a local design team in Europe, like in Amsterdam and some in the U.K. to really bring that local design edge to the customer experience.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Hello.", "Howard Schultz", "Hello. Hi Bonnie.", "Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Hi. Just sticking on Europe, I just have a few questions. Could you provide more color on how you expect to improve your food offering in Germany and then in general what are some of the steps you are taking to develop a deeper consumer connection throughout Europe and then how long do you anticipate this will take? And finally, could you talk a little bit more about your action plan to fix some of your supply chain issues in the region?", "Michelle Gass", "Sure. Thank you, Bonnie for the question. I think there is few layers to that. First, let me address the customer experience. To build on what I said, really emphasizing what Starbucks has done so brilliantly over the last 40 years, is the first half get hand and we have done some things new in the region that we haven\u2019t done anywhere else in the world at this scale, which is things like deepening the personal connection, names on cups, names on partners.", "And I can tell you that on roundtable since we\u2019ve put that in place the customers are really seeing this now as a unique thing that Starbucks does. And they are getting to know their customers in much deeper ways. We\u2019re taking advantage of our social media channel. We are outpacing many of competitors in the region. We have more than doubled our presence in Facebook and Twitter. We have done new websites across the region, both in company-owned and in licensed stores, all of which are surrounding and enhancing the customer experience.", "As it relates to food, we\u2019ve made nice progress. I will tell you we\u2019re just getting started. In the U.K. we re-launched our muffin platform; dramatic improvement in quality. We\u2019re seeing that show up in customer response and in our sales. We\u2019re also doing some testing on new distribution models for food. We\u2019re working through and we stated this throughout the year. We had a major change in our logistics and we\u2019re working through that. We\u2019re very confident that as we move to the year ahead we\u2019ve worked out some of the start-up challenges that any retailer would have with that scale of a change.", "And then to your specific question around Germany. As we studied the food opportunity there, there is lots of regional opportunities that we can take advantage of. The core Starbucks and the customer of Germany they want the core offerings. They want the muffins and the cakes and we have an opportunity to do a better job there.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you, Michelle. That concludes Starbucks\u2019 fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2012 conference call. We thank you all for joining us. We\u2019ll talk to you again in early December at our Biennial Conference.

Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, vice president of investor relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Joining me on the call today from New York is Howard Schultz, chairman, president, and CEO, and with me here in Seattle are Jeff Hansberry, president of our channel development and emerging brands business and Troy Alstead, CFO.", "Also available for the Q&A session are Cliff Burrows, president of Americas here in Seattle with us, and joining us from London is Michelle Gass, president of EMEA; and from Tokyo, John Culver, president of China/Asia Pacific.  ", "This conference will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K.", "Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will also be available on our website.", "Before I turn the call over to Howard, let me cover a few housekeeping matters. Today we filed an 8-K that outlined a few reporting changes, including the shift of certain G&A expenses from \u201cother\u201d to our four reporting segments. The results we\u2019ve reported today reflect these changes. ", "We have also recapped full year results for fiscal 2010 through 2012, and have posted the recapped financials on our website. They should be there shortly.", "Additionally, Starbucks\u2019 2013 annual meeting of shareholders will be held in Seattle at 10 am Pacific time on Wednesday, March 20. That meeting will be available via webcast as well. With that, let me turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?", "Howard Schultz", "JoAnn, thank you, and good afternoon to everyone on today\u2019s call. I am very pleased to report the record first quarter fiscal 2013 results Starbucks announced today: strong global comp store sales growth with comps of 7% in the U.S. and in the Americas, record quarterly revenues of $3.8 billion, and increase in our total company operating margin to 16.6% and a record earnings of $0.57 per share, the highest quarterly EPS in Starbucks history. ", "Noteworthy is that Starbucks\u2019 record Q1 results were delivered against a backdrop of weak consumer confidence and an overall weak global economy. With nearly 70 million customers visiting our more than 18,000 stores on seven continents in 61 countries each week, Starbucks\u2019 Q1 results demonstrate the strength, unique resilience, and increasing relevance of our global business and brand. ", "And the momentum we have built coming into Q2 ideally positions us to kick our growth plans into high gear and to deliver increased profits to our shareholders in 2013 and beyond, as we continue to execute against our blueprint for profitable growth and plans for adding thousands of net new stores over the next five years. ", "Not evident from record operating results alone are the facts that in Q1 we also drove significant, relevant product and beverage innovation and provided an enhanced in-store experience to customers around the world and implemented strategic operating improvements throughout the organization to streamline the business and deliver increased operating efficiencies into the future, all while delivering the strongest holiday performance in Starbucks\u2019 42-year history.", "I\u2019ll touch on a few of these developments and then turn the call over to Jeff Hansberry, President of Channel Development and Emerging Brands, and then on to Troy.", "As I\u2019ve said many times over the years, core to Starbucks\u2019 success are our store partners, our ability to attract, develop, and retain the very best people in our industry, and our ability to create inspired moments for our customers. I\u2019m delighted to report that our U.S. partners achieved record levels of productivity in Q1, an extraordinary accomplishment given the high volume of customer traffic and thousands of Verismo demonstrations in our stores during the holiday season.", "To my partners around the world, I say thank you for all you do to bring the Starbucks experience to life in our stores and for our customers every day, and particularly for your hard work and effort that enabled us to deliver the results we announced today. On a personal note, I also could not be more proud of the fact that last week Starbucks was recognized for the 15th year by Fortune Magazine as one of the 100 best companies to work for. ", "Despite what for many retailers was a lackluster holiday season, Starbucks\u2019 holiday exceeded our own expectations with successful promotions including the \u201c12 Days of Gifting\u201d the return of Christmas Blend, and a fresh take on gifting with our well-received lines of limited edition holiday merchandise.", "This season, and for the first time, a Starbucks card was perhaps the nation\u2019s single most frequently given holiday gift, with one in 10 U.S. adults receiving a Starbucks card and $2 million worth of our exclusive first-ever steel Starbucks card selling out on Internet luxury goods retailer Gilt.com in only, believe it or not, six minutes.", "The Americas segment comp store sales increased 7%, driven by a 4% increase in traffic. Within the American segment, our U.S. business delivered revenue growth of 9% and and outstanding comp growth of 7%, driven largely by increased food and beverage sales and robust holiday activity, driven by significant robust traffic.", "The U.S. remains a market rife with growth opportunity for Starbucks, and we will profitability capitalize on this opportunity by adding 1,500 new stores in the U.S. market and renovating thousands of existing stores in a locally relevant, energy efficient, and environmentally responsible way over the next five years. ", "Roughly 60% of our new U.S. stores will be drive-through locations. Drive-throughs create incremental revenues and profits compared to traditional stores, and represent a fast-growing, highly profitable format for Starbucks, comprising just over one-third of our U.S. company-operated stores, but contributing nearly 45% of our U.S. retail profit. And we are investing in this high-margin store format with innovations that will further elevate the customer experience, our brand, by enhancing drive-through efficiency and consistency of service. ", "Since our acquisition of La Boulange, we\u2019ve been testing in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we continue to see an opportunity to exceed plan and drive incremental food sales and attachment. With the 40 Starbucks test stores currently carrying the La Boulange bakery assortment, we\u2019re experiencing a lift in both pastry and total food sales, and we are on plan to introduce the La Boulange bakery assortment to the Starbucks stores throughout the Bay Area and in Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City in fiscal 2013.", "Starbucks\u2019 China and Asia-Pacific segment now spans 12 countries that by the end of fiscal 2013 will grow to nearly 4,000 stores, including 1,000 stores in Japan and 500 in Korea. China-Asia Pacific continued to deliver in Q1, with a strong 11% increase in comp store sales marking our 12th consecutive quarter of double digit comps in that region.", "We started our journey in China with our first store in Beijing in 1999, and in Q1 we celebrated the opening of our 100th store in that extraordinary city. China remains Starbucks\u2019 most significant market opportunity in this region, and is well on its way to becoming our second-largest global market in 2014. Today we are proud to operate over 700 stores in mainland China, and we are on plan to have 1,500 Starbucks stores in over 70 cities across China in 2015. ", "In India, we continue to be awed by the overwhelming customer response to our first four stores in Mumbai, and are eagerly anticipating the opening of our first store in Delhi next month. And in early February, we will open our first Vietnam store in Ho Chi Minh City.", "I was in the region last week, and saw firsthand the execution against the turnaround of our EMEA segment, and it\u2019s well underway. We are driving increased customer and brand relevancy and at the same time, we are updating our growth model for this segment, and we\u2019re beginning to see tangible benefits of these initiatives. ", "In fact, despite the worst economic retail climate in decades, and one that has been disproportionately impacting high-end retailers, I\u2019m proud to share with you that Starbucks\u2019 retail transactions in the EMEA region increased in Q1 compared to Q1 of fiscal 2012. ", "Building connections and providing our customers with a meaningful value proposition also continued to be among our top priorities across this region. Towards those ends, in Q1 we successfully launched the Starbucks card and the Starbucks Rewards loyalty program in Germany, and introduced promotions including our holiday beverage lineup and \u201c12 Days of Gifting\u201d throughout the region, all of which were well-received and contributed to our success in the quarter.", "Licensing will be the centerpiece of our approach to growth and long term profitability in EMEA, and in Q1 we continued to see the strategy play out successfully. At quarter\u2019s end, we had over 1,000 licensed stores in the region, up 12% from a year ago, and we are seeing fantastic customer response and increasing customer demand and acceptance as we extend our retail footprint beyond the high street.", "Starbucks\u2019 business outside of the U.K. and Continental Europe, where we currently operate nearly 500 stores, continued to thrive in Q1, with strong comp growth in key markets including the Middle East, Turkey, and Russia, with our long term, 15-year partner, Alsea. ", "We opened a stunning new 45,000 square foot flagship store in the Kuwait Avenues mall that celebrates local design culture and offers a truly unique premium coffee experience in the region\u2019s first Clover and Starbucks Reserve coffee selections.", "In Russia, we entered St. Petersburg, our first city outside of Moscow, and the stores are performing ahead of plan, demonstrating once again the strength, the relevancy, and unique appeal of the Starbucks brand across the region. We remain committed to creating a long term, sustainable and profitable business across EMEA and our solid performance in Q1 gives us confidence that we are very much on track to fulfilling that commitment.", "Our channel development and our emerging brands team is bringing significant innovation to the coffee, tea, and health and wellness categories. Jeff will be joining us later in the call to discuss several exciting developments in this segment in detail, so I\u2019ll just touch on a few highlights.", "In September, as you well know, we launched the revolutionary Verismo system by Starbucks online, and in October we extended distribution to include nearly 2,000 specialty retailers and over 4,000 Starbucks stores in the U.S. We intentionally limited distribution to a select subset of specialty retailers to establish the brand at the high end in the marketplace. ", "Going forward, we will drive adoption through a combination of pod and machine innovation and selective retail expansion throughout 2013. To date, well over 1 million customers have had the opportunity to sample a high-quality Starbucks latte or brewed coffee made with the Verismo machine at one of our many product demonstrations at either a specialty retailer or a Starbucks store.", "With more than 150,000 Verismo machines sold since launch, Verismo is off to an exceptional start as we build, enhance, and expand what we are confident will be a multi-billion dollar premium single-serve platform in the months and years ahead.", "At the same time, single-serve and VIA sales in Q1 were fueled by a number of popular new introductions, including Starbucks Peppermint Mocha VIA, Pumpkin Spice VIA, and VIA Refreshers, as well as Anniversary Blend K-cups and Christmas Blend K-cups. Jeff will speak more about momentum and opportunities in our single-serve business in a moment. ", "On December 31, we closed our highly strategic acquisition of premium tea brand Teavana, making Teavana, a wholly owned subsidiary of Starbucks and the newest addition to our emerging brand portfolio. Together with our new partner at Teavana, Starbucks will apply and leverage our deep knowledge of retail operations, beverage development and preparation, and our social and digital media loyalty card and mobile expertise to attract more customers to Teavana stores. ", "And we will expand Teavana\u2019s current 300-store footprint from largely mall-based stores to urban street locations, where Starbucks obviously has very strong capabilities and ultimately we will reinvent the tea category, just as we did the coffee category 40 years ago. ", "Teavana is the perfect complement to Starbucks\u2019 current billion dollar plus Tazo brand, and will enable us to further extend our leadership position in the $40-billion global tea market. Earlier this quarter, we opened our first Tazo retail store in Seattle to serve as a learning laboratory and help us understand everything from what types of hand-crafted tea beverages customers wanted to see from us, to help us to create a meaningful and differentiated retail tea experience for customers. Our plans are to apply all of these learnings to our Teavana rollout in terms of the success and enduring opportunities we have for that company. ", "In the health and wellness space, Evolution Fresh is leading innovation and development of the cold crafted juice category. Since our acquisition of Evolution Fresh, we\u2019ve redesigned the packaging, strengthened the brand positioning, and created four retail conceptual stores. And today, we\u2019re seeing growth in our Evolution Fresh business across the board.", "Coffee will always be at the very core of Starbucks\u2019 business, and our commitment to innovating and growing our share of the global coffee market is unwavering. Starbucks\u2019 Blonde Roast is an example of this commitment. In response to customer demand for super-premium coffee with a lighter note, we introduced Blonde Roast one year ago, and today Blonde is driving growth across all channels and Starbucks has emerged as a leader in the $1 billion light coffee segment.", "Sales of packaged Blonde Roast were 70% incremental at Starbucks retail stores, and 79% incremental in grocery channels in the last year. And we are continuing to find new ways to reach customers who prefer a lighter roast, with Vanilla Blonde, our first hand-crafted brewed coffee offering in our retail stores, as we speak today.  ", "In response to strong customer demand, we are also continuing to expand availability of our rare and exotic Starbucks Reserve coffees, and are on track to increase the number of stores offering Starbucks Reserve by approximately 200 in fiscal 2013. Our customers love our reserve Starbucks offerings, as demonstrated by the fact that a very rare Costa Rica Geisha Reserve coffee offered online in early December at $40 per half pound sold completely out in 24 hours. ", "We look forward to adding more rare and exotic coffees to our unique Starbucks Reserve lineup for our customers to savor in the months ahead as we reaffirm, day in and day out, our leadership position in all things coffee.", "Another very significant Q1 highlight was the continued growth and success of our digital business and mobile initiatives. Starbucks digital strategy is, and will remain, a key driver of our increasingly global business as we leverage all of our proprietary capabilities and connect with more customers all around the world in the future. ", "Our Starbucks card is more popular than ever today, accounting for 25% of U.S. tender, and an increasing portion of Starbucks card transactions and sales are being paid by using our mobile payment apps, with mobile payments now accounting for nearly 20% of overall card transactions. Over 7 million customers now use one of our mobile payment apps, translating into 2.1 million mobile payment transactions each week, with hundreds of thousands of additional Starbucks mobile app downloads each week.", "In terms of what happened in holiday in Starbucks card, I must say it was stunning and almost unbelievable. Our Starbucks card had its best holiday season in history, as measured by any metric, with more than $1 billion loaded during Q1, the most ever loaded onto any kind of Starbucks card. Mobile e-gifting also delivered record holiday results, with the most popular days for e-gifting being Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.", "With performance enhanced by the integration of our mobile strategies and our unique ability to send messages directly to our customers\u2019 mobile in-boxes. And our ecommerce sales also broke holiday records, as revenues doubled and we offered online sales in Canada, the U.K., Germany, and France for the first time.", "We\u2019re very excited about the strong customer response and tremendous future opportunities presented by the integration of our mobile, web, card, and loyalty program strategies. The combination of these capabilities enabled us to accelerate growth in our My Starbucks Rewards program. And this is another unique fact, in which we added 1.4 million members in Q1 of 2013, an 86% increase over the 778,000 new members we had in Q1 of last year.", "I\u2019m very pleased that our My Starbucks Rewards program was recently named the \u201cMobile Program of the Year\u201d by Mobile Marketer, an award that reflects Starbucks\u2019 focus on innovation and driving customer engagement.", "As our Q1 results demonstrate, the momentum we\u2019ve built throughout 2012 carried through holiday and into Q1 in 2013, but we are just getting started, and only beginning to see the benefits of the convergence of our retail, CPG, and social and digital media initiatives.", "Think about this. We had 86% more customers sign up for a My Starbucks Rewards card in the first quarter of 2013 than in the first quarter of 2012. And it\u2019s not that these new card customers didn\u2019t know where to find us last year. It\u2019s that we are more deeply connected, and even more relevant, to them than any other time in our history. And we can very accurately anticipate the increased traffic and revenue that will flow from the accelerating card acceptance and activity, which we\u2019ve already seen in calendar Q1.", "We remain committed to attaining leadership in the single-serve category, and I can tell you today that with Verismo we are in the nascent stage of building a multi-billion dollar platform for Starbucks over the long term. And we are in it for the long term. We will achieve our goals around single serve by leveraging the full power of the Starbucks brand and our unique partner, digital, and global store footprint assets in continuing to expand our distribution channels.", "But more importantly, we will continue to innovate and to transform the premium single serve category while continuing to surprise and delight our customers along the way. Look for some very exciting innovations to come this very year.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff Hansberry, who will take you through the Q1 results of our channel development segment, and share additional detail around what\u2019s to come in this dynamic growth area for our company. Jeff? ", "Jeff Hansberry", "Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m pleased to join you on the call today to discuss Q1 results for channel development in emerging brands, as well as give you some additional insight into what\u2019s coming in the quarters and years ahead.", "Channel development revenue in our first fiscal quarter grew 13% to $380 million. It was the highest revenue quarter we\u2019ve ever had, led by continued growth of K-cups, the first stages of launching our Verismo platform, and continued growth in roast and ground coffee.", "Our top to bottom line translation was also very good in Q1. We grew profit twice as fast as sales in the quarter, even after a significant investment in Verismo. Operating margin expanded by 230 basis points in Q1, up to 25.5%. Favorable coffee-related costs, along with continued strength in our North American coffee partnership, helped to fuel the growth. ", "Our partnership with Pepsi is thriving, and we plan to grow Starbucks\u2019 share of the massive ready-to-drink category with the expansion of Starbucks Refreshers beverages, the introduction of our new line of Starbucks iced coffee in a new, iconic single-serve glass bottle, which is rolling out as we speak in select U.S. markets.", "We will have national presence by April, just in time for the warmer months. But know that nearly 50% of iced coffee drinkers actually enjoy iced coffee year round. We will now be very well-positioned to serve the rapidly expanding demand for iced coffee in the U.S. In fact, now, one in five beverages sold in Starbucks retail stores is a cold coffee beverage.", "Turning our attention to other coffee formats, I want to discuss the premium single cup category and the recent milestones achieved across our product lines. VIA Ready Brew continues its solid performance, growing 16% in the food, drug, and mass space in the quarter. VIA Refreshers has been available and very popular in retail stores over the past six months, and we\u2019re excited to make them available at CPG beginning this quarter.", "K-cups were the largest contributor to channel development revenue in Q1, as we sold more than 175 million cups across the company in the quarter. And then there is Verismo, which saw strong retail support and customer interest, with more than 150,000 machines sold across all channels since launch.", "Q1 marked the beginning of what we expect will be a significant and sustained expansion of Verismo in the quarters and years to come. We will expand distribution, adding both new doors and new countries to the platform. We will add new products, including many Starbucks favorite beverages across coffee, tea, and more to the platform. And we will add new machines, with additional functionality and style elements that will help us to drive adoption of the platform.", "Rolling all of this up, in the U.S. food, drug, and mass channels in the past 13 weeks, we have grown our total premium coffee business by 28% versus prior year. That\u2019s 11% faster than total U.S. premium coffee category, and nearly four times faster than the entire U.S. coffee category.", "As a result, we have grown our share of the total U.S. coffee category to 12.6%, 220 basis points higher than a year ago. And encouragingly, as our internal analytics and these numbers suggest, we are seeing little cannibalization of our roast and ground coffee from our success in premium single cup.", "The expansion of Starbucks Blonde Roast, now in its second year, will be one of the growth drivers of packaged coffee going forward. This growth will be supported by marketing in our retail stores, through our social and digital channels, and through our biggest-ever multichannel marketing and demonstration campaign in CPG, starting this month. It is truly our blueprint for growth in action, and will introduce millions of potential new Starbucks customers to Blonde Roast.", "Beyond Blonde Roast, we will introduce new varieties of K-cups later this year, and as mentioned earlier, new varieties of Verismo pods as well.", "Now I\u2019d like to talk about the new organization that we have just finished building, branded solutions. This organization combines the capabilities of food service with our expertise in licensed stores, allowing us for the first time to create a single one-voice solution to reach our customers across a number of channels, from hotels to offices to colleges to hospitals. ", "Now, each development manager can present an account or prospective account with a full portfolio of offerings, including Starbucks, Seattle\u2019s Best, Tazo, and Evolution Fresh, and provide a complete solution, from a food service and licensed store perspective, all supported by one relationship management, all supported by a high-quality Starbucks experience for the customer. It is a breakthrough that will come to life in 2013.", "The next significant growth engine in the emerging brand portfolio is tea, which is fueled by both Tazo and Teavana. The Teavana acquisition closed on December 31, and we are embarking on the next chapter of a journey that we believe will reinvent the way the world enjoys tea, just as Starbucks did decades ago for coffee.", "By the end of the year, we expect to add over 30 new Teavana stores, including the opening of our first neighborhood store, which will combine both an expanded hand-crafted tea experience with merchandise and loose tea. Down the road, we intend to offer an enhanced range of hand-crafted beverages into our mall-based stores as well.", "In the near term, our priorities are integrating the company and employees, now our partners, sharing and learning about each company\u2019s respective culture and importantly, maintaining our focus on delivering our plan for the balance of the year.", "While it has been less than four weeks since the acquisition closed, our integration work makes us as excited as ever about the opportunity, and we\u2019ll share more details as we move along.", "Tazo continues to perform in the super premium packaged tea space, growing by over 30% across all forms in the quarter. The brand continues to be the share leader in the super premium filter bag space, with a 28.6 share in the most recent 13 weeks ended December 30, up 160 basis points from prior year.", "Now, from tea to juice, where Evolution Fresh is leading the development of the $3.4 billion premium cold-crafted juice category. We continue to build the brand through a new distribution and are now in nearly 4,000 Starbucks and natural and grocery stores in the western U.S. We are on track to open our new state of the art juicery in late spring, which will further allow us to grow our plan to be in approximately 8,000 stores by the end of the year.", "In closing, 2013 is off to a strong start, with much more on the horizon. We plan to continue demonstrating strong revenue growth while expanding margin. We will do it through innovation, both around new platforms and new SKUs. We\u2019ll do it through growth of a best-in-class portfolio of existing products. We will leverage unmatched cross-channel marketing and promotional capabilities, and we will rely on the expertise and passionate commitment of the more than 500 channel development partners around the world who continually exceed expectations.", "With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Troy Alstead. Troy? ", "Troy Alstead", "Thank you, Jeff. As Howard indicated in his opening remarks, this holiday season was Starbucks best-ever, and the proficiency with which our store partners delivered daily world-class experiences again drove record results in the Americas.", "First quarter Americas revenues totaled $2.8 billion, growing 10% over last year. The largest driver of our revenue growth continues to be strong comparable store sales, which reached 7% in Q1, with a 4% lift in transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket.", "In the U.S., comps mirrored those of the Americas region. Our U.S. productivity continues to climb, as we saw more transactions per labor hour this quarter than in any other quarter in our company\u2019s history. That allowed us to [lift] [ph] daily transactions per store to over 700 for the first time, as we continue to expand capacity and grow transactions across all day parts.", "Also fueling our strong comp growth were our fall promotional beverages, headlined by pumpkin spice latte, combined with our always popular holiday beverage offerings. Combined, these added more than a percentage point of comp growth. ", "A significant increase in food sales, and a favorable shift in food mix, as breakfast sandwiches and our improved lunch offerings continues to resonate with our customers, also added more than 1 percentage point of comp.", "Verismo contributed approximately a half point of comp in Q1, leveraging the successful demonstration and sampling efforts of our store partners.", "The first quarter in the U.S. started strong and ended strong, with comp growth in December mirroring the full-quarter result. As we exited the first quarter, the momentum in the business, combined with the record volume of Starbucks cards loaded during the holiday period, is fueling early Q2 sales trends. ", "Comp growth in the first few weeks of January is trending consistent with the first quarter. Operating income in the Americas segment reached a record $590 million in the first quarter, while operating margin contracted 50 basis points to 20.8%. ", "There were a few anomalies that led to the margin contraction, including our October global leadership conference, which impacted margin by 90 basis points, increased litigation charges, which had a 70 basis point impact, and 30 basis points due to the impact of Superstorm Sandy. The phenomenal execution by departments across the region largely offset these unusual cost pressures in the quarter.", "Now, in China and Asia-Pacific, a combination of solid performance from our existing store base, and rapid new store development, led to record revenue on profit. Revenue growth was 28%, an increase over last quarter\u2019s 23% growth. A portion of this was due to comparable store sales, which grew 11%, with 8% growth in transactions and a 3% increase in average ticket. Two-year comps remained above 30%, an exceptional accomplishment considering the uncertainty that has entered parts of the region over the past year. ", "We saw very successful holiday promotions in many of our CAP markets, with seasonal beverages driving sales growth over the same period last year. In addition, the Starbucks card was an extremely popular item in CAP in Q1, which bodes well for the future.", "Howard spoke in his comments about the success of the Starbucks card and our loyalty program globally, and in CAP these are meaningful drivers of strong comps. In fact, 29% of transactions in Thailand, and 27% of transactions in Singapore, are paid for with a Starbucks card, levels that exceed those in the U.S., where Starbucks card has been available for much longer.", "And as our loyalty program expands globally, it is apparent that is relevancy is universal. In China, for instance, we already have 1.3 million My Starbucks Rewards members. Loyalty to the Starbucks brand continues to grow in this part of the world, directly contributing to our rapid top line growth.", "The largest contributor to our CAP Q1 revenue growth was the addition of 125 net new stores in the quarter, and 452 net new stores over the past year. Half of these new stores are in China, where we continue to aggressively pursue high-quality, profitable real estate. ", "As I discussed last quarter, this [unintelligible] does have a temporary detrimental impact to operating margin, and, combined with the mix shift toward a more company operated store portfolio, accounted for more than the 50 basis point Q1 decline in CAP margin.  ", "Partially offsetting this was lower performance-based compensation. While performance is still very strong in the region, we are lapping the first quarter of 2012, when the CAP region performed significantly better than the operating plan for that period. Profitability remains robust and continues to accelerate quickly in the region, as the $72 million of CAP operating income in the first quarter was a record, and represented 26% growth over last Q1.", "In EMEA, revenue, operating income, and operating margin all expanded in the first quarter, as the team coupled solid traffic growth with continued focus on cost discipline. Record revenues of $306 million represented growth of 1% over last Q1, driven by 41% growth in licensed store revenue and 27% growth in our food service business.", "As Howard stated, we continue to see strong strong growth in many of our other licensed markets, as our partnerships continue to thrive and provide a meaningful contribution to our success. ", "The strong growth in licensed and food service was largely offset by a decline in company-operated revenue of 4%. That reduction was due to the loss of revenue resulting from the sale of the Ireland store portfolio and U.K. airport stores to a licensed partner, and closures of unprofitable stores as part of our Q4 store portfolio optimization.", "A decline in comparable store sales of 1%, driven by a 3% reduction in average ticket, also contributed.", "The lower average ticket was driven by beverage mix shifts and reductions in add-on purchases such as food, suggesting a trade-down impact of consumer spending, driven by the economic challenges in the region. ", "Encouragingly, traffic grew by 2% in the quarter, the highest rate of traffic growth EMEA has delivered in a year, as we are seeing traction on our efforts to demonstrate that Starbucks serves the best latte on the high street. ", "I our largest market, the U.K., we offered pumpkin spice latte for the first time, with tremendous success. Holiday beverages had a record year across the region, and the launch of the Starbucks card, and in this past year My Starbucks Rewards, in the U.K., Germany, and other markets in this region, as well as targeted value offers, played a key role in maintaining the loyalty of our core customers.", "EMEA operating income of $22 million grew by 18% over the last Q1. Operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 7.3%, the second-highest quarterly operating margin ever for EMEA, as a result of continued defocus on cost efficiencies, which drove strong leverage on our licensed stores revenue growth.", "The strong first quarter results in each of our operating segments contributed toward a record-setting performance on a consolidated basis. Revenue growth of 11% led to record total net revenues of $3.8 billion in the first quarter. The growth was driven by a 6% increase in global comparable store sales, including an increase in transactions of 4% and an increase in average ticket at 2%.", "This was a truly outstanding holiday season around the globe. Consolidated operating income grew 13% to a record $631 million in the first quarter. As I mentioned during the Americas discussion, there were a few unusual items impacting the quarter\u2019s results, which had an unfavorable 140-basis point impact on consolidated operating margin.", "However, strong sales leverage, and to a lesser extent the expected 50-basis point impact of favorable commodity costs, more than offset the unusual cost pressures, driving consolidated operating margin higher by 40 basis points to 16.6%.", "We also set a record for earnings per share in the first quarter, growing 14% to $0.57. Our earnings include two additional unusual items of note. We reported a lower than usual tax rate in Q1 of 30.4%. As we expected, and was factored into our tax rate guidance for fiscal \u201913, we recognized an $18 million benefit primarily from state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years.", "Conversely, this quarter we reported a $26 million reduction over last Q1, in interest income [and other], which includes mark-to-market adjustments related to commodity hedges, unfavorable foreign currency, and decreased unrealized gains in the trading securities portfolio of our management deferred compensation plan. The impact of movement in the trading securities portfolio is offset in general and administrative expenses as the compensation plan liability fluctuates with investment performance. ", "Also of note, Starbucks repurchased 8 million shares of stock during the first quarter. This leaves approximately 29 million shares authorized as available for repurchase. The combination of these repurchases, along with a $0.21 per share dividend, resulted in more than  $500 million returned to shareholders in the first quarter, which is more than the first three quarters of last year combined.", "It was a fantastic first quarter by nearly every measure. We exited the quarter with everything squarely on track, which is why we are reaffirming our financial targets for fiscal 2013, which I announced on our Q4 FY12 earnings call in early November.", "These include strong EPS growth of 15-20%, revenue growth in the range of 10-13%, global comparable store strong growth in the mid-single digits, consolidated operating margin targeted at approximately 100 basis points, 1,300 net new stores globally, capital expenditures totaling approximately $1.2 billion, and a tax rate of 33%.", "One item not factored into our targets, but worthy of mention, is the pending [craft] arbitration ruling. While there has been no ruling or resolution yet, and no change for expectations, we do anticipate resolution later in the second quarter. ", "This was the best holiday season and first quarter in the history of Starbucks, setting the stage for another strong year. The record results of the first quarter once again demonstrate our ability to drive growth in revenue and earnings in the current quarter while planting the seeds for growth into the future.", "Our store partners are delivering great coffee and great experiences to our customers every day, and doing it with higher levels of productivity than ever before. We have a deep pipeline of innovative products, diverse channels and geographies for growth, and strong execution and financial discipline. We enter the second quarter with great momentum, and are well-positioned to deliver our growth targets for the year. ", "With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open. ", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan", "First, if we could review what your remodel strategy is for fiscal \u201913, how significant that could be and what you\u2019ve been seeing in the control sample in terms of what the performance of those stores are versus the stores that you haven\u2019t done. And secondly, and I think it\u2019s short, when might you have an opportunity to put Evolution products or Teavana products as part of the hand-crafted beverage line within Starbucks? I think that might be a very big opportunity for innovation around your product line. If you could discuss when that could possibly be. ", "Troy Alstead", "I\u2019m going to ask Cliff Burrows to speak first, to the remodel strategy, and then he\u2019ll start the discussion about Evolution and Teavana in Starbucks stores. And then Jeff Hansberry here will be part of that discussion as well. Cliff?", "Cliff Burrows", "With regard to refurbishments this year, and I\u2019ll talk specifically to the largest market of the U.S., we\u2019ll do the same number of refurbishments plus or minus as we did last year, as I shared in December when we met in New York. Where we have done major refurbishments, we have seen significant improvement in the capacity we\u2019ve built in that store, and the additional opportunities to introduce Clover, for example, have all seen significant lifts. And our strategy around minor refurbishments carries on as it always has been. That\u2019s about putting the store back in a good state. So really no changes there, and if I hand it to Jeff around development of hand-crafted beverages\u2026  ", "Howard Schultz", "Cliff, why don\u2019t you be specific about how many stores we plan on touching in the balance of the fiscal year? ", "Cliff Burrows", "It will be about 1,400 stores that we will cover this year, and that will be a mixture, 60-40, of minor to major. That sort of magnitude. About 500 major refurbishments this year. Jeff? ", "Jeff Hansberry", "Thank you. So in terms of Evolution Fresh and Teavana entering Starbucks stores, as we\u2019ve talked before, this is a critical element to our blueprint for growth strategy. And so from an Evolution Fresh standpoint, we have already started moving the Evolution Fresh brand into Starbucks stores, and in fact now we\u2019re in over 2,400 Starbucks stores, primarily in the western U.S. ", "And as our new juicery comes online, that will give us additional capacity to begin to move east in this year. So we\u2019ll continue to expand Evolution into Starbucks stores, and also into the natural and premium grocery segment as that brand continues to expand. We\u2019ve had great results so far.", "With regard to Teavana, we\u2019re less than four weeks into the integration, but we have said all along that Teavana beverages will play a role in Starbucks stores. We\u2019ll come back with more details in the coming quarter, as we develop that plan. But Teavana will play in Starbucks over time. ", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan", "And the question was really not just on ready to drink, but also the hand-crafted beverages potentially, that you could do with those sub-brands. ", "Cliff Burrows", "I would say yes, the potential is there. Our priority is to roll out the Evolution bottled juices across the U.S. and let Jeff do his work on the integration of Teavana. More to follow on that. Nothing to show at this time. ", "Troy Alstead", "I think the one last thing I\u2019d add, John, is the key theme here is that these acquisitions and both product platforms absolutely offer us opportunity to raise drink across multiple channels and hand-crafted, and is something that in the right sequence of brand development and integration and roll out of these products, you will see us pursue those opportunities, and it\u2019s part of what gives us confidence in our ability over multiple quarters and multiple years to continue to drive strong same-store sales growth for our system.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from UBS. Your line is open. ", "David Palmer \u2013 UBS", "First question on China. It seems like your same-store sales is remarkably stable. How would you characterize the consumer environment there? And secondly, with regard to the Starbucks card loads, Howard mentioned a statistic there. I didn\u2019t quite catch that. How much do the dollar loads grow year over year in that quarter? ", "Howard Schultz", "John, are you on the line from Japan? Can you answer the question about China? ", "John Culver", "Sure. First off, we\u2019re extremely pleased with the continued momentum of our business in China, both in terms of the performance of the existing stores as well as the new store growth that we\u2019re seeing. And as I said, more and more of our growth is coming from the new store base, and less so from comp sales. ", "Our comp sales have remained strong, and when you look at it on a two-year basis, comps are in the mid-30s. And on a three-year basis, comp sales are up into the 60s. So we feel very good about what\u2019s happening with the consumer as it relates to the Starbucks brand. There\u2019s no doubt that you\u2019ve seen some shift with other businesses and other companies in China. ", "But for us, our traffic in our stores remains very strong, our transaction growth continues to grow. The card, in terms of the adaptation of the Starbucks card, we\u2019re now at 1.4 million customers. And that continues to accelerate, and that\u2019s just over a year old. And we continue to be very encouraged about the innovation that we\u2019re bringing into our stores, the way that the customers are reacting to that, and how they\u2019re embracing the Starbucks experience. ", "Troy Alstead", "And Dave, to your question about the Starbucks card, there was a 25% increase in Starbucks card value loaded in the first quarter over the prior year. What\u2019s critical about that is that clearly is a very strong level by itself, significantly outpaces the growth in the overall business, and is exactly a harbinger for that future growth as those values loaded not only introduce new customers onto the platform but deepen the loyalty, create that frequency opportunity as we move through the balance of this year and into the future.", "Howard Schultz", "I would just add that I believe that we are in the nascent stage of being able to leverage and integrate social, digital, mobile, our investment with Square, and the loyalty program into a very significant and robust opportunity going forward. And the question that was asked about Teavana in terms of products, you know, at some point there\u2019s a natural opportunity as part of the integration to take those assets, drive incremental traffic into Teavana, benefitting from the ubiquity of Starbucks and the trust and loyalty in that program.", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Your line is open.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair", "I had a follow up question on China. It looks like the rate of investment in the stores continues to accelerate beyond the revenue growth in the company on units. I was just wondering, what are you doing in the stores that\u2019s obviously facilitating great same-store sales. But if you can give us some sort of insight into the investment you\u2019re putting in those four walls, as that store operating expense continues to ramp. ", "Howard Schultz", "John, would you speak to the investment trend? ", "John Culver", "Sure. Sharon, I think it\u2019s important that the investments that we\u2019re making are going to set the foundation for the future in terms of the success of the stores, and of the market overall. So when you look at the investments we\u2019re making it\u2019s obviously in the stores themselves, but more so from a people standpoint, in terms of ramping up the people, capability, that we\u2019re going to need to staff the new stores. And so with that, we\u2019re bringing on people, we\u2019re bringing them into existing stores, and we\u2019re training them to take over and run the new stores that we\u2019re opening.", "In addition, the investments that you\u2019re also seeing in the stores have to do with the investments we\u2019re making around the design and how they are adapting into the local architecture, and making sure that we\u2019re differentiating ourselves in the marketplace in terms of the third place environment that we\u2019re creating for our customers.", "So when you look at this, we are making the investments that we need to sustain the growth for the long term. I think what we\u2019re seeing is that the investments we\u2019re making in our people is paying off in terms of the experience that we\u2019re able to provide our customers, the speed that we\u2019re able to put them through the stores, and just the connection that we\u2019re able to build with them.", "And then the investment that we\u2019re making from a physical store perspective is creating that third place environment that our customers want to come to, be a part of, and to experience overall.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America ", "Can you comment on coffee costs year over year? Just what that cost looked like year over year this quarter, and what it might look like in coming quarters? And also could you fill out a little more on the 13% growth in the channel\u2019s development category? Food service obviously less, CPG more. And just talk about the components of that growth, and whether the lower coffee costs play a role in maybe restraining that revenue growth a bit. ", "Troy Alstead", "Sure. I\u2019ll speak to coffee costs and then I\u2019ll hand it to Jeff to talk about channel development growth. First, with regard to coffee, as we expected, we had approximately a net $0.02 per share benefit from commodities this quarter. That includes favorability in coffee, and then moderate unfavorability in dairy and a couple of other smaller commodities in our portfolio. So about $0.02 a share. Again, that\u2019s expected. That is 50 basis points to the total operating margin improvement in the first quarter. ", "And I expect about that same $0.02 per share benefit from net commodity each quarter over the balance of the year. And again, that\u2019s all consistent with our previous targets. As we have discussed in the last few months, that amounts to about a net $100 million benefit to this fiscal year and given what we have lost in terms of pricing in fiscal \u201914 and also what we see in the coffee markets right now, we expect a similar level of $100 million benefit as we approach fiscal \u201914. So at least a couple of years of commodity tailwinds ahead of us.", "Jeff, can you speak to channel development growth? ", "Jeff Hansberry", "With regard to channel development, as you noted, we grew at 13% in the first quarter. We continue to see positive growth ahead of retail average in channel development. Our packaged coffee business overall, when you look at premium single cup, as well as roast and ground, we\u2019re seeing significant growth in the quarter from an IRI standpoint. From a food service standpoint, less so. We\u2019re still growing faster than the food service segment, which is a material piece of our business. But that segment continues to grow more slowly than the balance of the category. ", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America ", "And Jeff, do all the coffee costs play into that revenue growth in one way or another? ", "Jeff Hansberry", "Well, we\u2019re continuing to see a lot of competition in the marketplace, but we think we are well-positioned to continue to grow our share and our business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. ", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird ", "Troy, I have a question on the guidance for 2013, with respect to the margins. Up 100 basis points. Relative to what you reported in Q1, which was up 40, but you had quite a bit of unusual cost items in there. So I guess why wouldn\u2019t the 100 basis points be on the conservative side as you look at not having some of those unusual cost items in the coming quarters, or are there some potential offsets that maybe I\u2019m not thinking about? ", "Troy Alstead", "David, I appreciate your confidence in our ability to drive profit as we go forward. I would say that 40 basis points of improvement in the first quarter, and yes, that was net of some unusual pressures in this quarter. We believe that the guidance we have, which that 100 basis point improvement for the full year corresponds to the 15-20% earnings growth that we\u2019ve targeted, and that I believe we\u2019re right on track for. ", "So I think with the investments we\u2019re making to drive the business, continued investments across our new growth platforms of La Boulange, of Verismo, of Evolution Fresh, while we are delivering quarterly earnings just as we did in Q1, we continue to lay that foundation for growth next year and the year after. ", "And it\u2019s been that equation that this works so well for us and that we intend to navigate as we go through the rest of the year. So I think the guidance we have is remarkable in this environment and feel very confident in our ability to deliver against it as we approach Q2 and onward. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ", "Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Troy, could you possibly remind us about the planned marketing spend, maybe as a percentage of sales for the year, how that compares year over year? And then maybe the quarterly cadence? Was 1Q with the Verismo launch above the annual spend, and Q2 with Blonde is that above 1Q and above the full year? Any details on that would be very helpful. Thanks. ", "Troy Alstead", "Sure. The marketing spend in this first quarter was a little higher than 4% of sales, which for Starbucks and our history is extremely high, perhaps among the highest we\u2019ve ever recorded in any one particular quarter. And as we talked about, I think, dating all the way back to July when we first [announced] our initial guidance, that\u2019s really primarily driven in this quarter by the launch of the Verismo platform and our investment against that, knowing that\u2019s a multiyear platform and proposition for us, and we wanted to set it off on the right foot.", "As we progress through the balance of the year, I don\u2019t expect marketing spend as a percentage in any quarters to be at that same level as higher than 4%. So I expect it will be in the 3.5% to 4% range as we progress through the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter. Fairly consistent throughout the year as we approach introducing the customer and providing those messages to first Blonde and then other product platforms as we go throughout the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ", "John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "First, if I could just clarify, is channel development, the 13% growth we\u2019re seeing this quarter, is that representative roughly of the growth we should expect throughout the balance of the year? Or is there something you think materially changes that trajectory? I just wanted to clarify that from a previous question.", "And in EMEA, you talked about the average check declining. What reverses that? I think you explained it has something to do with trade-down. Is this the first quarter you\u2019ve actually seen declines in average check there? Or has that been going on subtly, and it\u2019s just more exaggerated this quarter?  ", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, John. This will be a good opportunity for us to ask Michelle Gass, our president of EMEA, to jump in. She\u2019s calling in from London. Michelle, can you speak to average ticket in the region? ", "Michelle Gass", "Absolutely. You know, I would say first off that we were really pleased and proud with our results for the quarter, seeing the kind of both revenue growth, especially in our licensed channel, which is our key focus and strategy going forward. Importantly, the margin expansion that Troy spoke to, despite the significant headwinds that continue to face the European customer. And then further, actually seeing transactions plus customer count growth of 2% for the quarter, and seeing that across our market. So again, given the headwinds, we\u2019re very, very pleased with that result. ", "We did see a deeper erosion of ticket than we have been experiencing, so your question is relevant. And we saw it especially with everything happening on the retail high street, the downturn there, particularly acute pressure with consumers in our European markets. We\u2019re not, by the way, seeing that same pressure play out outside of Europe. It really is focused on the U.K. and Europe.", "And we have continued focus, both in keeping our customers coming through loyalty programs, through relevant value, and then also working on increasing our food attach through food innovation programs and of course that beverage trade-down, focusing customers on our great assortment of beverages. We saw great response, as Troy mentioned, on pumpkin spice. Right now we\u2019re experiencing great customer demand on our innovation vanilla spice. And those initiatives will help us prop up our ticket. ", "So it is a focus, but job number one is to keep our loyal customers, and keep that customer count growing. Thank you. ", "Troy Alstead", "I think Jeff can speak to the follow up on CPG growth? ", "Jeff Hansberry", "With regard to channel development growth of 13% in Q1, while we don\u2019t offer specific guidance on individual businesses, we expect that channel development will continue to grow at a rate faster than our average retail growth. Importantly, we have a number of initiatives that we\u2019re working against, and building. Everything from Evolution Fresh to our continued expansion of K-cups, to new flavors and SKUs in the VIA lineup. And importantly, we will continue to invest and grow and build over time the business that\u2019s in its very nascent stage that is Verismo.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays", "Just two quick questions, the first one just on the Verismo, I guess as a follow up. And you talk about the launch in the holidays going well. I think you said 150,000. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how that tracked versus your expectation. Obviously it was a heavy investment quarter for it. But do you think there\u2019s obviously some time for this to build with the replacement cycle around Keurig? I\u2019m just wondering kind of the early feedback on Verismo and your outlook for growth over the next number of quarters.", "And then separately, Troy, if you could just comment, I think the share repurchase I think you mentioned was 8 million shares, which would be roughly $400 million for the quarter. I\u2019m just wondering if you could frame that in terms of your thoughts on cash usage for fiscal \u201913, whether it be between [repo] and maintaining the dividend, versus capex, and whether we should assume that first quarter share purchase was an anomaly, or that type of run rate would be sustained.  ", "Howard Schultz", "Can I just start with an overall strategy about single-serve and Verismo, and Jeff, you can take it from there if it\u2019s okay with you. I think it\u2019s very important that you all understand that we are deeply, deeply committed to becoming the leader in this space domestically and internationally. We have plotted out a multiyear strategy about Verismo and an overall single-serve platform that will include multiple layers of innovation in the years to come. ", "We feel very strongly that what Verismo demonstrated this holiday season was a great success for us. It met our expectations. We learned a great deal. We also saw a fair amount of discounting from our competitors in the market as a result of our entry, and the fact that we disrupted the market in the middle of the holiday season. ", "The leverage and the asset that we have in our stores to both demonstrate, inform, and ultimately sell single-serve platform machines is an asset that is proprietary and nobody has, and we will continue to utilize that to our advantage. ", "The other thing that I think is worth saying is that we already are seeing customers come back with the opportunity to merchandise and sell them pods as a result of Verismo being in 150,000 households. So we\u2019re already seeing an opportunity for incrementality there and we\u2019ll be adding more SKUs that are proprietary to Starbucks coffee. ", "And so our commitment, our interest, our motivation to build on single-serve and build on Verismo is 100% and we are going to maintain a high level of commitment and investment in this, where we are going to be the global leader. Jeff? ", "Jeff Hansberry", "Exactly. In that first, our sales during our very first holiday, with a brand new to the world platform, were well in line with our expectations. And importantly, we started with a very curated small set of stores. So a select set of specialty retailers and a select set of Starbucks retail stores. ", "And for us, we are not only encouraged by the customer response, but also the trade traction that has been created by a number of retailers who want to play on the platform, which we have not made available to them as yet.", "So there are really three things that are going to be growth drivers for Verismo as we step forward. First, and importantly, the innovation itself. It\u2019s the first and only machine that does brewed coffee, espresso, and lattes. And that message got through to customers during the holiday.", "And secondly, as we add innovation to the system, whether it\u2019s through additional coffees, additional espressos, additional Starbucks latte and seasonal favorite beverages, as well as tea, that will add to increase the interest in the platform.", "And then finally, from a machine standpoint, we have a pipeline, to Howard\u2019s point, multi years of machine innovation, that adds new features, new styles, new functionality, to a whole series of machines that we will be introducing. ", "So again, and importantly, this is just the very first step in what will be a multiyear growth driver, significant growth driver, in the channel business and for Starbucks overall. ", "Troy Alstead", "To your question about share repurchases, we\u2019re fortunate that the very strong cash flow of our business enables us to have the dividend, and we\u2019ve accelerated that dividend, as you know, each year since we\u2019ve initiated it. ", "And also, share repurchases. We repurchased 8 million shares in the quarter. Our repurchase program is very valuation and conservatively valuation based. So our repurchases in any particular quarter are very opportunistic, based both on, again, what we see in the market and the valuation. ", "And also, from time to time, where and when we as a company might be blacked out of the market, and that is frequent given various activities going on. So in any particular quarter, our share repurchase activity will be somewhat lumpy, again just based on those factors.  ", "I would say our priority spend of cash for the balance of the year, and really every year, continues to be first and foremost investing back into the business. That\u2019s in our partners, in capital expenditures, in new stores and remodels. Of course, funding the dividend over time. And then based on those metrics and principles I outlined, share repurchases. ", "So I don\u2019t have a prediction for you of whether that Q1 8 million shares is something that we\u2019d repeat each quarter or not. That, again, will tend to vary quarter to quarter. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. ", "Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "I have a two-part question on the Americas. The first is just in terms of comps, I know you highlighted a couple of things that were drivers, some of which were new, so Verismo, some of which have been around for a while, so food and some of your holiday beverages which are always very popular. So I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about to what extent the loyalty, or the Starbucks card, may have added to comps. If you can measure that. ", "And then the other piece of this, was there anything about your mix or about any of the promotions you did that might have affected your margins? I ask only because you had some nice margin expansion on the cost of sales line, but maybe not quite as much as I would have expected given 50 basis points of commodities plus such healthy comps on which you would have seen occupancy leverage.", "Troy Alstead", "Let me hand it over to Cliff to speak about the comp drivers, and I think he\u2019ll also be able to speak to cost of goods and leverage a bit. In advance of that, I would just make the one comment that the large majority of those unusual expenses that I spoke about in the quarter, the leadership conference which we are known about, and then a couple of events that we had not know about until we got into the quarter, things like Superstorm Sandy and some of the unusual litigation expenses I mentioned, were predominantly focused in the Americas P&L. ", "Absent those anomalies and those unusual cost pressures in the quarter, we would have been on more of our common pace of very significant and meaningful margin expansion in the quarter. ", "Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Understood. I was just talking about the cost of sales line in particular.  ", "Clifford Burrows", "The quarter, we really saw a very healthy mix of our core beverages as well as our seasonal beverages. Very, very encouraged throughout the quarter how they performed. Our food continues to go from strength to strength, and I\u2019m really excited about what lies ahead of us with La Boulange. The holiday season, and that is both core coffee, with our Christmas Blend, and also our gifts this year, performed exceptionally well.", "If I look at day parts, we have seen growth in all day parts. The early morning growing fastest, in terms of percentage, but we continue to add more transactions at our peak time, which again is a really healthy situation to be in.", "And this is a mixture. It\u2019s coming from a mixture not only on product, but we continue to work on the operational effectiveness in stores and work we\u2019ve shared with you before around [Lean] [ph]. So building that capacity at peak remains a priority for us.", "And bringing that all together, I have to say it\u2019s been the focus and dedication from our partners in the stores, who across the whole of the U.S. and the Americas have done an amazing job in this quarter dealing with our busiest holiday season ever. ", "And the card, I wouldn\u2019t call out what percentage that\u2019s contributing to it, but it is certainly with more people joining My Starbucks Rewards, by an increasing tender, there is definitely a much richer dialog coming along. ", "There is a much greater recognition between the customer and our barista, and we\u2019re adding, as you know, this quarter, we\u2019re adding to the customer experience through introducing names on aprons, which will be in stores by the end of January, and then phasing in names on cups in the coming months. So all of it focused on the relationship between the customer and our barista, and making it a great personal Starbucks experience. ", "Troy Alstead", "And then Sarah, back to, specifically, your question about cost of goods, the largest impact of commodity favorability as you know comes in our channel development business. So within the Americas segment, that commodity benefit in the quarter was about 30 basis points or so to OI, perhaps a little bit higher. And so just roughly 30 basis points of benefit from commodities, total cost of goods and I can see leverage improve by about 50 basis points. I hope that gives you some context. We actually did see exactly the kind of leverage we would expect, both from commodity benefits on that cost of goods line, and then also leverage on the fixed costs from growing sales.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "And we will have time for one last question. And I apologize to those of you left in the queue. We will try and get back to you as soon as we can this afternoon. ", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Nicole Miller Regan from Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.", "Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray", "I think you had mentioned at the analyst day something about the future of a brand-agnostic loyalty card. Can you give us an update on that? And given that you are talking about the different ways, shapes, and forms that a customer can access Starbucks today, would this require them to get a new card? ", "Howard Schultz", "I don\u2019t think I understood the question. Can you repeat that please? ", "Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray", "Sure. I think there was talk at the analyst day about a channel agnostic loyalty card, so that it doesn\u2019t matter if I get a cup of coffee this morning at a retail store or buy a pound of coffee at the grocery store is the way I originally understood the intent. That idea incentifies as a loyal, frequent Starbucks user. When you do roll that out down the road, do I have to consolidate the other cards that I might have? And I\u2019m just wondering, since you are talking so much about gift cards and different forms of Starbucks cards and the way of processing payments and gifts and all of that, is this all going to eventually roll into one?  ", "Howard Schultz", "Well, I think you\u2019ve asked us a question that, with respect, we don\u2019t want to get into too deeply today. But let me try and answer without being coy in any way. Over the next few months or so, we\u2019ll be coming back to you and sharing with you the plans that we have to take advantage of Starbucks products within CPG, and specifically grocery, and leveraging the technology and the advancement of providing value to our customers that are buying Starbucks products in grocery, and leveraging the card.", "I don\u2019t want to get into too much specificity today, only to tell you that we strongly believe that this will provide an incentive for our customers to not only buy Starbucks coffee, but integrate them even further in the Starbucks ecosystem with the card loyalty and mobile. And we are very excited about this, and we will be sharing this with you in the months and quarters ahead. This is something we believe in, and something that we are deeply committed to.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "That concludes our Q1 fiscal 2013 earnings conference call. We thank you all for joining us today.

My name is Mike and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Starbucks Coffee Company\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.", "Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference call.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you, Mike. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Joining me on the call today is Howard Schultz, Chairman, President, and CEO; Cliff Burrows, President of our U.S. and Americas Business and Troy Alstead, our Chief Financial Officer.

And you will find them in the P&L for all other segments. Results of removed unallocated corporate expenses from Other. Full-year results for fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2012 for all Other segments a well as our corporate unallocated expenses can be found on our website.", "With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn and good afternoon to everyone on today\u2019s call. I am very pleased to report the record Q2 results that Starbucks announced today. Global comp store sales growth of 6%, marking the 13th consecutive quarter of comp growth greater than 5%, comp growth of 7% in the U.S., total revenue growth of 11% to a Q2 record of $3.6 billion, 180 basis points increase in operating margin to a Q2 record of 15.3% and record Q2 EPS of $0.51, which after excluding a $0.03 gain on the sale of the Company\u2019s minority equity stake in the JV that operates our stores in Mexico represents a 20% increase over last years record Q2 results.", "Starbucks is continuing to deliver strong consistent performance in the phase of still challenged retail and consumer environments in many of the markets around the world in which we operate. While I\u2019m very pleased with the record results we\u2019ve been reporting in the value that we\u2019ve been creating for our shareholders over the last several years. As I\u2019ve mentioned at our annual meeting of shareholders last month, we remain laser focused on our aspiration to become one of the worlds most admired, respected, and enduring brands.", "I\u2019m honored with the progress we\u2019re making on this journey has been recognized by Ethisphere Magazine, who for the seventh straight year name Starbucks as one of the worlds most Ethical Company and Fortune Magazine who recently ranked us as the fifth most admired company in the world. Neither this humbling and inspiring recognition, nor our Q2 results would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our 200,000 Starbucks partners who done the green apron everyday and deliver the unique Starbucks experience, 70 million times from almost 19,000 stores in 52 countries around the world each week. From Starbucks leadership team to each of our partners we say thank you.", "In a few minutes Cliff Burrows, President of our Americas segment will discuss Americas Q2 results in detail and provide a glimpse of what\u2019s ahead. Under Cliff\u2019s leadership Starbucks U.S. business today is at healthy as it ever has been. We continue to introduce new innovative ways to excite our customers around all things coffee. And clearly anyone suggesting in 2008 or 2009 that Starbucks U.S. retail store portfolio was approaching market saturation was just flat out wrong. In fact, stores we\u2019ve opened in the last few years are among the best performing stores in the 42-year history of the Company in terms of all key metrics, including unit economics, return on investment, profitability and the qualitative aspects of how well we deliver the Starbucks experience to our customers.", "This performance is due to a new discipline and rigor we\u2019ve brought to all aspects of store development that is both underpinning and driving our U.S. retail expansion. We plan to add approximately 3,000 new stores in the Americas over the next five years with at least 1,500 being in the U.S. and are now on track to open over 300 new stores and to renovate 14 other stores in the U.S. this year alone.", "Our China and Asia-Pacific region continues to be at the forefront of Starbucks global expansion efforts and we are on course to have 4,000 stores in the region by the end of 2013, including more than 1,000 stores in Mainland China and more than 500 stores in South Korea.", "We will establish China as Starbucks single largest market outside of the U.S. in 2014 and have more than 1,500 stores by 2015. We are building and deepening our connection to customers in China by continuing to deliver locally relevant innovation, including Chestnut Macchiato and Peach Blossom Tea Latte, two customer favorites' seasonal beverages evocative of the flavors of the Chinese New Year season and actively building My Starbucks Rewards membership.", "We have now sold over 2 million My Starbucks Rewards cards in China representing an average of 2,000 members per store and the highest first store average anywhere across our global retail system, the sales on cards now representing 35% of total tender. This is a powerful endorsement of the emotional attachment and engagement we now have with Chinese customers in relationship to the Starbucks brand.", "A few weeks ago, John Culver, President of our China and Asia Pacific segment and I traveled to Indonesia and the Philippines, key growth markets as well as being the sources of some of Starbucks best tasting and best selling coffees. John and I observed firsthand how powerfully the Starbucks culture and the Starbucks brand coupled with the new store designs are resonating with our partners and customers.", "We now plan to open 100 new stores in Indonesia in the next three years and another 100 stores in the Philippines over the next four. And next month, John and I will be in Tokyo to celebrate the opening of our 1,000-store in Japan, an historic achievement for the first Starbucks market that opened outside North America and personally a rich reminder to me on how far we've come since I attended the opening of the first store in the Ginza district back in August of 1996.", "In Q2, we also opened our first store in Vietnam to record crowds, another dynamic market with a rich cultural heritage in coffee tradition. Our flagship Ho Chi Minh City store will be followed by stores in Hanoi and other key metropolitan cities across Vietnam in the future.", "Michelle Gass and her team are in the early stages of a transformative new economic business model for Europe that will further move us towards long-term profitability. We are actively continuing to expand our new UK franchise program with a number of experienced and well capitalized regional and national franchise operators as well as growing our captive licensed store footprint into important customer segments such as rail stations, airports, universities and hospitals.", "We're also making considerable headway in the growth of our drive-through operations, adding our first drive-through store in Germany and adding to our drive-through portfolio throughout the UK. These and other strategic moves together with a robust set of brand initiatives will provide competitive differentiation and make Starbucks more relevant to Europe's diverse consumer base.", "Starbucks performance across our joint venture and license markets in Eastern Europe and the Middle East continue to be extremely strong with growing customer response in markets such as Turkey, Hungary, Russia and across our Middle East portfolio, thanks and good measure to our partnership with the Alsea group that started with a single store in Kuwait City in 1999 and now comprises over 500 Starbucks stores throughout the Middle East.", "Our Q2 results give me confidence that the strategies we have in place across Europe and the Middle East combined with an intense focus on execution and elevating our customer experience will enable us to make solid, continuous progress in the EMEA region over time, as we continue to leverage all of the learnings from the U.S. transformation.", "Last quarter, Jeff Hansberry, President of our Channel Development and Emerging Brands segment detailed an extraordinary, multibillion dollar opportunity that exists for Starbucks in channels outside of our stores. Today, Starbucks has over 100,000 points of distribution across grocery, drug, mass and club locations around the world and sales topping $1 billion, with nearly 25% of the $3.4 billion U.S. premium coffee market making us the number one thing in packaged coffee brand in America. From this strong position Starbucks channel development opportunity remains in its infancy. Premium single cup currently an $8 billion categories of fastest growing segment in the coffee industry, now accounting for 27% of total coffee sales in grocery. And premium single cup is a segment Starbucks intends to lead with a solid product lineup that includes Starbucks VIA, Starbucks K-Cup portion pack and now Verismo. We continue to build Verismo\u2019s install base to generate incremental pod sales with a successful promotion on cable Home-Shopping Channel QVC in March.", "In Q3 we will gear up for a robust fall and holiday by further extending Verismo distribution to include additional specialty retailers and expand the Verismo portfolio to include both machine and pod innovations including tea. All of which will culminate in our stores what we anticipate to be a very strong Christmas holiday shopping season. Starbucks K-cup portion pack sales in U.S. food, drug and mass channels out case the industry at large increasing more than 75% versus the prior-year and maintain a leading share in the premium single cup category. This last week Starbucks K-cups remain one of the top product launches of the year by IRIs pacesetters. I am pleased to report that we have now shipped over 850 million Starbucks and Tazo cups since launch.", "Q2 marked our first quarter since completion of the Teavana acquisition, an important move into the $40 billion global tea category. The tea category we believe is right for innovation and we now intend to do for key what we have done for coffee. Beyond representing a very exciting retail store platform with strong unit economics Teavana enables us to add super premium estate teas to our tea lineup and introduce and leverage a multi-brand tea strategy to complement our existing billion dollar plus Tazo tea business.", "In Q2 we opened eight Teavana stores and have plans to add additional mall stores in fiscal 2013 and to add a complete line of handcrafted beverages to the Teavana menu over time. We also expanded Starbucks loyalty program to include Teavana purchases giving Starbucks customers the convenience and benefit of using their Starbucks card and mobile app to pay for purchases in Teavana retail stores. To further leverage the best capabilities of Starbucks retail including real-estate design and store operations I\u2019ve asked to Cliff Burrows to lead the Teavana retail business as part of our U.S. and Americas business with Andy Mack, Teavana\u2019s founder reporting to Cliff.", "Our Evolution Fresh Cold-Pressed Juice platform continues to grow nicely and there is now more than 4000 Starbucks stores and other retail locations including 300 Starbucks stores in the New York and Boston markets. We continue to see healthy sales lift in juice as customers increasingly make Evolution Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Juices a part of their daily ritual. And we\u2019re working hard to increase production, capacity to meet the growing consumer demand and our plan to have Evolution Fresh juices available in approximately 8,000 U.S. locations by the end of 2013.", "It's now been more than two years since we unveiled and began to execute against our unique blueprint for profitable growth strategy in the U.S. and the time is now right to begin taking our tested embedded blueprint on the road to China. Our success at retail in China is providing us with confidence to both continue building our retail store portfolio and to leverage our brand growing retail store footprint and deepening connection to Chinese consumers into a future overall business that will also include Starbucks products and categories marketed through CPG channels to the rapidly growing Chinese middleclass. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting initiative in the quarters ahead.", "I want to turn now to global payment, loyalty and social and digital media. As I have shared with you before, we're witnessing a seismic change in consumer behavior due to the emergence of social and digital platforms and a significance and ubiquity of mobile as a consumer platform, and Starbucks remains on the very leading edge of all of these developments. In Q2 we introduced new innovations and initiatives that further demonstrates Starbucks leadership in consumer card, loyalty and mobile payment experiences as more and more of our customers choose the Starbucks card as their preferred method of payment. Consider the following statistics; today, nearly one-quarter of all U.S. transactions are made by My Starbucks Rewards loyalty members and nearly one-third of all U.S. in-store transactions are prepaid.", "Our mobile apps now have more than 10 million active customers and we are approaching 4 million U.S. global payment transactions per week, accounting for roughly 10% of total U.S. tender. To put this in perspective, Starbucks card tender now exceeds $3 billion annually in the U.S. and Canada, a scale that rivals many premier U.S. banks.", "In Q2 we significantly accelerated My Starbucks Rewards membership by offering a $5 credit for U.S. Starbucks cardholders who became a program member, resulting in nearly 1 million new registered members and nearly 500,000 global app downloads during the two-week offer period alone.", "Through this and other initiatives, we are adding approximately 80,000 new My Starbucks Rewards customers each week and expect to double the number of active members enrolled in Starbucks Rewards program from 4.5 million at the end of fiscal 2012 to 9 million in 2013.", "Even more encouraging is that accelerating adopting is not just a U.S. phenomenon. We are now seeing usage of My Starbucks Rewards at the same or even higher rate than the U.S. in countries like China, Korea and Canada, providing us with a significant sustainable competitive advantage over competitors in these markets.", "And beginning in May, we will unveil the market's first cross-plan, cross-channel rewards program, a capability only made possible by the unique combination of Starbucks national retail store footprint, broad consumer package goods presence and industry-leading digital capabilities.", "Our customers will be able to earn My Starbucks Rewards stars for purchases of Starbucks packaged coffee in grocery channels. The star can then be redeemed for free food or beverages in Starbucks retail stores, an exciting new example of our blueprint for profitable growth being brought to life.", "It's very hard, I think, to actually explain this in the kind of detail or the attachment that we think this is going to do, and this gives us a significant competitive advantage over other like coffee products that are sold in grocery, and we're going to see incrementality as a result of that in our own retail stores.", "The revenue and operating leverage provided by the scale and synergies among our digital, card loyalty, mobile and social platforms provides us with strong core muscle in our U.S. business and increasingly in multiple channels in markets across the globe. And Adam Brotman, Starbucks Chief Digital Officer and I'd like to tell the digital team we are just getting started literally in the nascent stage.", "Today, Starbucks ability to touch people in and beyond our stores is greater than any time in our history. And as a reality that gives me great confidence that we can obtain the high aspiration of becoming one of the worlds most respected and admired and enduring companies.", "We are very fortunate to have added [Mike Conway], our new Executive Vice President for Channel Development as well as Sharon Rothstein and Matthew Ryan as Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Strategy Officer respectively to help us achieve these ambitious goals joining an already experienced and talented leadership team. I'd like to personally take this opportunity to publicly welcome Mike, Sharon to Starbucks.", "I'm convinced that the next two to three years for Starbucks will be among the most dynamic and exciting periods in the history of our company. The results we announced today demonstrate that Starbucks Coffee Company has the strength, the health and the talent to continue profitably building our business in multiple channels around the world, at the same time as we continue delivering value to our shareholders.", "I'll now turn the call over to Cliff who will take you through the Q2 results of the America segment.", "Cliff Burrows", "Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon everyone. I'm very pleased to join you today to discuss the strongest second quarter results of our Americas business and to share with you several new exciting initiatives we have ahead of us. Americas revenue grew by 10% in the second quarter to $2.6 billion, fueled by 6% same-store sales growth with 5% coming off increased transactions and 2% from the higher average ticket.", "In the U.S., comp sales grew by a very healthy 7%, a number of drivers were behind it. We had a great success with our featured beverages including Vanilla Spice Latte and Hazelnut Macchiato, which combines nearly two percentage points of comp growth in the quarter.", "Food sales also lifted our comp, with strong growth in the afternoon from offerings from food offerings aided by expanded panini availability and strong Bistro Box performance. On our first quarter call, we talked about the strength of Starbucks card sales during the holiday and how that gave us great confidence in our ability to deliver a strong Q2. That absolutely played out this quarter and what is particularly encouraging is we\u2019re seeing a lift in both afternoon daypart and in our high priced indulgent beverages by card users. There are significant number of new customers and new occasions being introduced by Starbucks card leading to new daily routines and greater loyalty, all of which bodes well for our future growth.", "While America segment revenue grew 10%, operating income grew 22% to $550 million. We delivered strong flow through on our exceptional sales growth with margins in the Americas growing by 220 basis points to 21.1% in the second quarter. That is the highest Q2 margin we have ever reported in the Americas segment and there are several things contributing to this improvement.", "Firstly, we are intensely focused on store operations, including (indiscernible) waste and utilities management. We are improving productivity as well and this is allowing us to increase customer visits without adding costs. For example, our new (indiscernible) are leading to simplified operations which in turn allows us to bring in new products or minimizing additional complexity to the system. We are also benefiting from lot of coffee prices; this alone provided 40 basis points of favorability in our costs and occupancy line in Q2.", "Today's public stores are busier than ever, but we remain very conscious that outstanding service is what brings back customers again and again, that is why I am so proud about the focus of our store partners. The focus of store partners continues to place on delivering the Starbucks experience. We can see from customer voice metrics within the U.S. taste of beverage and speed of service rules are among the highest levels in recent years. Friendliness and order accuracy also moved meaningfully high in the second quarter. All these combined led to the highest total increase and our overall satisfaction goes in two years.", "We continue to grow strongly outside the U.S. with Latin America delivering double-digit revenue growth. The success was seen in our licensed markets across the region together with the potential of Brazil, giving confidence to Starbucks future growth across Latin America. Our performance in Mexico is particularly exceptional, which is why we are so excited to build on the strong foundation already in place and enhance our intent to open 250 new stores over the next five years as part of the sale of our equity there. That sale is consistent with our strategy to simplify equity structure.", "Looking ahead, there are number of values that been critical to our growth. One begins next week as we signaled the return of summer at Starbucks by launching our new Caramel Ribbon Crunch Frappuccino and this will be to accompany the full line up as signature handcrafted Frappuccino beverages that are being in our stores for nearly 20 years. This will be a strong compliment to the retaining line of chilled summer beverages including ice coffee, ice teas and our handcrafted refreshers.", "Food is also near and long-term growth driver for the Americas. Our overall food program continues to perform well and we are excited about what's coming in the U.S. with La Boulange. At the end of the second quarter we had 150 Starbucks stores having La Boulange products. As of today we\u2019re in 439 stores, having rolled out to the entire San Francisco Bay Area. And unless we\u2019ve seen this far, what is still early has been encouraging. I look forward to sharing more detail with you as all of the sites become in more meaningful.", "What I can tell you is the La Boulange pastries will roll out in specific Northwest including Seattle, in June then we'll expand to cities including Los Angeles and Chicago, followed later in the year by New York and Boston. We remain on track to have La Boulange products in all of our U.S. company operated stores by the end of 2014.", "Another area of focus for the team is unleashing the real potential we have in drive-thru. As Howard mentioned, in the last quarter the majority of U.S. new store growth over the next few years will come from drive-through. The business case is very compelling. Our drive-thru stores have healthy profit margins as we're able to better leverage fixed occupancy costs and depreciation with sales coming from both out of the window and in the caf\u00e9.", "We're not only focused on opening new drive-through stores, over the past two years we've conducted a deep analysis on how best to enhance efficiency and the customer experience through the drive-through window. As a result, we have already improved our menu boards, optimized operational standards and upgraded our equipment. These improvements are driving faster speed of service, high order accuracy and improved customer satisfaction.", "We're still in the early days of our overall drive-through innovation. As we know our relationship with customers is just as important as the drive-through window as inside the caf\u00e9 and our priority as well as our financial results over the coming years will reflect this.", "Meanwhile, we're focused on maintaining the high quality of our existing portfolio, updating stores to approximately 1,600 renovations across the Americas segment this year. While we don't state meaningful overall sales lift due to routine renovations, we do see immediate results when we add new programs or increase capacity as part of the work.", "As Howard mentioned, our integration to Teavana business is well underway and I'm extremely proud to now be leading this premium, innovative concept, and I know the expertise we have gained over 40 years of coffee merchandising and our leadership in handcrafted beverage preparation will translate tremendously well to the high level of product quality and innovation already associated to the Teavana. We're excited in the coming quarters to share more about the ideas and plans that are emerging.", "All that we have accomplished and all that we have yet to accomplish would be impossible without what is far and away Starbucks most important asset, our people. I can say with certainty that my Americas leadership team has never been stronger than this today. We have great stability and rich diversity resulting in a deep talented bunch.", "While I get the fortune of discussing our record results and tremendous growth with you all, it's important to remember that the partners in the 13,000 stores of the Americas region really made this all happen. So to them I'd like to say thank you.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Troy Alstead. Troy?", "Troy Alstead", "Thank you, Cliff, and good afternoon everyone. We are extremely fortunate that the Americas business produces results that consistently exceed what you would normally expect from a business so large and mature. Cliff cited many of the reasons behind that success; innovation, consistent delivery of outstanding customer service and a deep entrepreneurial spirit. It's the consistent strength of the Americas performance that allows us to nurture the seeds of growth outside of the Americas.", "I will now talk to the second quarter results of those businesses. In China and Asia Pacific, we continue to [grow] rapidly while delivering strong results. Net revenues of $214 million represented 22% of growth in the second quarter and reverted by a mixture of 15 net new store openings over the past year along with same-store sales growth of 8%. Considering the difficulties that others are experiencing in this part of the world, coupled with the fact that we are lacking extremely strong comp of 18% last year, we are very pleased with this performance.", "Half of our Q2 comp growth was due to increased transactions as customers were receptive to our seasonal offerings with continued strength from the My Starbucks Rewards program in China also contributing. Ticket growth was due to a combination of pricing as well as sales mix.", "Operating income of $68.3 million [plus] operating margin of 32.0%, down [Technical Difficulty]. We have grown our company-operated store base by 35% in the past year, double the pace of growth in the region overall. And as I have indicated for some time now, that portfolio mix shift is strategically and financially very valuable, but it does currently have a negative mix shift impact in operating margin in the region.", "We added 56 new company-operated stores (indiscernible) in the second quarter, the highest number of company-operated stores we've ever opened in a single quarter in this region. We are solidly on track with our previously communicated growth trajectory in China and across the regions. Just as with last quarter and as we expect to continue, this higher pace of growth carries with it investment spending to open and operate these new stores. That also led to a portion of the margin decline we reported this quarter.", "Finally, we reported a year-over-year decline at $2.1 million in income from equity investees in the second quarter. This is entirely the result of favorable non-routine income of $6.7 million in the second quarter of last year. Our partnerships across [capital thriving] including in Japan where comps and new store growth are both higher this quarter than in the prior-year.", "In EMEA the difficult economic climate and continued weakness in retail football continued to impact our business. Total net revenues of $273 million reflect the last Q2 with license store revenue growth of 48% offset by a 6% decline in company operated revenue. The license store revenue growth was primarily the result of the addition of 117 license stores over the past year combined with strong comp growth.", "The company operated revenue declined, it was the result of the declining company operated store base which is the outcome of the store closures we\u2019ve previously spoken about as well as the sale of a number of company operated stores to license partners. Also contributing was a 2% in comparable store sales. Profitability in EMEA remains challenged, but we're making progress on a number of fronts.", "Operating income for the quarter rose to a positive $5.2 million up from a loss of $7 million in Q2 of last year. Our continued disciplined focus on cost management is one of the items contributing to the improvement. Additionally we\u2019re beginning to see the benefit of our portfolio mix shift to a more heavily licensed model. EMEA net new store growth in Q2 was entirely comprised of license stores also contributing to the Q2 profitability with a $5.7 million reduction to the estimated asset retirement obligations of our store leases in the region.", "We are in this for the long run in Europe. It will take time to grow our license business in the region and it will take time to drive increased profitability to our existing company operated store base. The opportunity in Europe and the Middle East is meaningful though and the eventual payoff will be well worth. I mean now moving to channel development where revenues of $344 million grew 7% over the prior-year. The second quarter as it is the case for all of fiscal 2013 for channel development reflects slower growth as we continue to develop and invest in the products and businesses that will drive more rapid growth in future years.", "The channel development business consists of the larger highly profitable but slower growing roast and ground coffee in food service businesses which account for approximately two thirds of current channel development revenue, and a smaller, faster growing single-serve ready to drink in international businesses. While these newer businesses account for only one third of our channel development revenue today, we are building for the future with new capability, distribution and innovation across VIA, K-cups, Verismo, Iced Coffee, Refreshers and Tea. The investments we\u2019re making now will help fuel solid, long-term growth in the segment in the coming years.", "During the quarter, dollar sales in the roast and ground coffee category declined 3.5% versus prior-year in U.S. food, drug and mass channels. And while we are pleased that we\u2019re outperforming the industry, we are not pleased that our roast and ground dollar sales did not grow over that same period. Nearly all of our competitors have reduced pricing over the past several quarters and has announced earlier this month we have responded with a list price reduction effective in May. We believe our move reflects the right pricing in this environment along with other unique loyalty and value drivers such as My Starbucks Rewards will provide value and relevance in the category to grow share.", "K-cups continue to be an outstanding contributor to our channel development business and were the primary driver of revenue growth in the quarter. Starbucks K-cups share of the premium single cup space in U.S. food, drug and mass channel grew 2.3 percentage points to 14% in the quarter reflecting the continued momentum of this still young platform. Bottom line growth in channel development in the second quarter outpaced top line growth. Operating income of $94 million grew 18% over last year; operating margin expanded 270 basis points to 27.4% as lower coffee related costs provided year-over-year favorability.", "Finally, let me briefly touch on our other segments. JoAnn briefly mentioned at the beginning of the call that we have included results for Teavana along with Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee, Evolution Fresh, the Tazo retail store and our digital ventures business and are reporting under all other segments. For the second quarter the year-over-year growth in revenue and operating income of these other segments was primarily due to the inclusion of Teavana results this quarter for the first time, then the other businesses also contributed to the revenue growth. We are working to integrate inline Teavana reporting and as this becomes a more meaningful portion of our consolidated results, I expect that we will enhance our disclosure.", "Now, I will wrap up the second quarter on a consolidated basis before moving to targets for the remainder of the year. Consolidated net revenues grew to a Q2 record $3.6 billion representing growth of 11% over last Q2. This increase was due to comparable store sales growth of 6% including 4% coming from higher transactions and 2% from higher average ticket. Beverage and food innovation outstanding customer service and a growing base of highly loyal customers all were key contributors to this quarter's growth.", "Consolidated operating income grew to 26% to $544 million in the second quarter. Consolidated operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 15.3%, the highest Q2 margin we've ever reported. Leverage on our strong sales coupled with 50 basis points of lower coffee cost drove the improvement.", "The combination of strong sales growth in our core business, operational efficiencies in our retail stores and favorable commodity tailwinds led the record earnings per share of $0.51. This includes a $0.03 gain on the sale of our equity in our Mexico joint venture which is reported in the interest income and other line. Excluding this gain, EPS grew by 20% at the high end of our targeted range.", "Also of note, Starbucks repurchased approximately 3 million shares of stock during the second quarter. This leaves approximately 26 million shares authorized as available for repurchase. The combination of these repurchases along with the $0.21 per share dividend resulted in $309 million return to shareholders in the second quarter and brings our first half of fiscal 2013 total to more than $850 million.", "Now that we are halfway through fiscal 2013, I will provide an updated outlook for the year. Given our strong first half results and the momentum we are carrying into the second half of the year, we are raising our full year earnings per share target to a range of $2.12 to $2.18.", "For the third quarter, we're targeting EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.53. For the fourth quarter, we're targeting EPS in the range of $0.54 to $0.57. We now expect to add 1,600 globally reflecting the previously targeted 1,300 Starbucks stores in addition to 350 Teavana stores that were acquired or will open this year.", "We remain on track to deliver on all other previously communicated targets, including 10% to 13% consolidated revenue growth, mid-single digit global comparable store sales growth, approximately 100 basis points of consolidated operating margin improvement, a tax rate of 33%, and capital expenditures of $1.2 billion. Finally, we now anticipate resolution of the dispute with Kraft sometime in the second half of fiscal 2013.", "As we now progress into the second half of the fiscal year, we are extremely pleased that we were able to deliver yet another record set of results in Q2. Our Americas business continued its remarkable top and bottom line performance and we continue to demonstrate solid growth across our entire portfolio. We recently wrapped up our strategic planning for the next five years, and I can tell you that I've never been as optimistic at what lies ahead as I am today. The future growth potential of this company is as clear as it is diverse.", "Our opportunities to deliver industry-leading shareholder returns are as great as our opportunity to enhance the communities in which we serve. And the rigor and discipline with which we make decisions and proceed along this path will only be matched by the focus on the outstanding experience we deliver to each and every customer. I am excited for what lies ahead in the second half of this year and even more excited for what lies ahead in the coming years.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Mike?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs", "Can you guys talk a little more about your early experience rolling out La Boulange in the stores and that where do you use \u2013 because the lift was encouraging. I was hoping you could help us with what exactly encouraging meant? And maybe in your answer you could touch upon the impact to traffic versus ticket and whether you're getting a lift in coffee or just food?", "Cliff Burrows", "Thanks for the question. It's Cliff here. The reason I said encouraging, we are in 150 stores with any track record and we've been working live with this in refining the products as we've gone along. We are now in a meaningful 439 stores, so it will be much more meaningful when we report the next quarter and the coming quarters. I am firstly encouraged by the pride our partners in the stores have in sharing and serving and enjoying this food, the reaction of the customers, especially to the lemonades, things of the croissant, (indiscernible) and Almond Croissant which are the signature products of La Boulange. With any change, it takes time for people, customers to get used to new products, ourselves to get confident with those products and obviously we\u2019ve got a new routine with warming in stores. I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making. I\u2019m encouraged by the reaction, and again as I said I look forward to sharing more of that in the coming quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. On the earnings guidance, I guess just a couple of questions. One is; why are you raising it now, it would suggest an acceleration of earnings growth from a 20% range in the first half to 25%, so what are the components that drive that, first? And secondly, does it include that $0.03 and where is that $0.03 I can\u2019t find it, what segment is that in?", "Howard Schultz", "Thanks John. We\u2019re raising because first of all we\u2019re half way through the year. So we now have half the year in the bank, we\u2019ve been able to see two quarters worth of great top-line growth and great earnings growth, and that gives us increased confidence in our expectations for the balance of the year. I\u2019d also point out that we\u2019re just that much closer now to new products that will launch as we move to the balance of the year; how the seasons are trending; our ability to drive flow through on incremental sales. All of that now half way through the year has just increased in confidence and allows us to increase our guidance for the balance of the year and for the full-year. Specifically to your second part of your question; yes the all year-to-date results are reflected in that full-year guidance so that $0.03 of the Mexico gain is included in that new 212 to 218 range that we put out there today. And that is reported in the interest income and other expense, so you need to look at the consolidated P&L and you\u2019ll see a year-over-year change there. There\u2019s a number I think going on in that category but there\u2019s a big driver of this Mexico gain that shows up in that line.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Keith Siegner - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. Just a question about the new multi-channel loyalty program rolling next month. I mean, this is \u2013 it definitely is unprecedented, and I\u2019m sure, at least to some extent there\u2019s going to be some education required, but that\u2019s kind of the big opportunity right, you get to bring in a lot of the non-current loyalties as they realize this opportunity. If you could talk a little bit about that marketing program, maybe how you plan to message this? Do you roll it out first just to existing users? How do you get the broad based awareness of this new opportunity? Thanks.", "Jeff Hansberry", "Hi, Keith its Jeff Hansberry. We\u2019re very excited about bringing My Starbucks Rewards down the isle. And to your very point, today we\u2019ve got about 6 million My Starbucks Rewards customers. As we extend the program into channels we\u2019ll be able to reach an audience and make My Starbucks Rewards available and create awareness for the program to an audience that is 10 times larger than our current My Starbucks Rewards audience. The way we\u2019ll bring that to live is, in the store there will be point of sale material and there will be material on each and every package of roast and ground coffee to create rapid awareness with both our loyal customers and with new customers as they become aware of the program. We will thread MSR trough everything we do in channels and will become an integral part of every promotion that we run going forward. So, we have great expectations in how it will transform the way our customers experience the brand and their loyalty to the brand.", "Howard Schultz", "Jeff, maybe you can also say, the benefit we have about the stores within all of these stores, 1000\u2019s of licenses.", "Jeff Hansberry", "Yes, yes. Thanks, Howard. So, we\u2019ve got over 3000 license stores that sit within some of the best grocery and mass merchant real estate in the U.S. What that allows us to do is to create an ecosystem within the store where our customers have the opportunity to buy hand-crafted Starbucks beverages and also their packed coffee needs down the isle. And as Howard, mentioned in his comments; every time you buy a Starbucks roast and ground coffee you\u2019ll earn My Starbucks Rewards stars that can be redeemed for Starbucks food or Starbucks drinks. And now with those 3000 stores in the best grocery stores around the U.S. that makes it more relevant, it helps to thread it through or blueprint for growth more easily.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein", "Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to just talk about the channel development business briefly, obviously you said that you're pleased with the share gains, but would've liked to seen a little bit more growth in the biggest part of your business. I'm just trying to reconcile sort of the slower top line growth with, I think, what is continued confidence that there will be \u2013 that ultimately this business will be as big or bigger than retail, and if you could just talk about the cadence you see and maybe when some of these other initiatives will start to look a little bit or be a little bit more present to offset what appears to be sort of a slower growth core package business? Thank you.", "Jeff Hansberry", "Hi, Sara, it's Jeff Hansberry again. We remain very confident in the future of channel development. Q2 was a challenging quarter. In that we saw both a slowing in the roast and ground business overall combined with a lot of competitive activity on our largest segment, roast and ground. That said, we feel strongly that we have the right mix of value and promotion and merchandising and loyalty activity to reignite growth in our roast and ground business with the list price reduction that we announced this month that will take effect in May with the activation of the My Starbucks Rewards program with some new additional innovation that will be hitting the market in Q3 and Q4 to include a 40% increase in the number of SKUs of K-Cups across the Tazo Tea brand as well as the Starbucks Coffee brand, additional innovation hitting the market in VIA as well as our ready-to-drink portfolio with Starbucks Iced Coffee and some other new innovations that will come later in this year. So we remain very optimistic. And layered on top of what we're seeing in the U.S. business, we continue to be in the nascent stages of our international expansion. I think I've shared previously that today the channel business only operates in about 20 of the 62 countries where Starbucks has retail operations and we're working aggressively toward expanding beyond the U.S. with our CPG portfolio.", "Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc.", "Great. Thank you. In the press release, you mentioned that you had considerable momentum in business as you entered the second half, which is very encouraging and I'm just wondering, what's the read through of that comment to April same-store sales?", "Cliff Burrows", "Greg, we won't speak specific about April at all. What we can say with confidence is the great strength that we came through the first quarter, the holiday period that we've reported on previously as you know and then as we progressed through this quarter with a backdrop of, as you know, very choppy and mixed results broadly in the retail environment and with many other retail companies, we produced very steady, healthy strong growth and traffic growth and in same-store sales growth in the U.S. and consistent ability to leverage that strong top line into profit growth at the bottom. So no specific comments about April, but we exited Q2 in a very healthy place and that's given us confidence in terms of the low momentum combined with the pipeline of what's to come in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, the lineup of innovation across all channels encourages us that leads to our confidence in the momentum and that leads to our ability to speak with such confidence about the back half of the year.", "Howard Schultz", "Greg, I'll add one other thing. I think it's hard to perhaps really get underneath what's going on with social and digital media, the loyalty card and mobile. What I can tell you though is that we as a company have cracked the code on being able to leverage those platforms in a number of ways. To create awareness in trial of new customers who are not in the Starbucks franchise, to lower our cost of customer acquisition as a result of the fact that we're using these channels as opposed to conventional advertising. And then thirdly, we can analyze with great specificity that the loyalty and the stars that now will be leverage on to the CPG channel is significantly relevant to our core customers. When you combine that with what we've been able to do during peak periods in terms of efficiency and productivity plus creating new need stakes for customers in dayparts that in the previous years we have not been as busy as Troy said, gives us great confidence that the 7% comps that we sold in the first quarter and second quarter is stunning accomplishments when you look at the backdrop of the economy and what other people are reporting, especially given the environment we are in. So, I would say that the ecosystem that Jeff talked about and what we're going to be able to do with these programs going forward gives us the optimism that we are in very good shape for the balance of the year.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays", "Great. Thank you very much. It's a question on more so balance sheet, in terms of cash or even looking at the cash flow statement and after CapEx spend, obviously there is no shortage of cash. I'm just wondering if you can give us kind of an update in terms of forward discussions as it relates to and how you determine the right balance first of all this is the share repurchase and dividend, what is the right level there, because obviously you could be a doing a lot more of both. And then the potential whether its considered an increase in leverage obviously right now may be it is not your priority, but rates are fairly compelling, so I\u2019m wondering whether you consider boosting leverage or how you even think about the leverage \u2013 the right leverage level perhaps once the settlement is complete? Any thoughts on that front will be great.", "Troy Alstead", "Sure Jeff. I think the first thing I mentioned is where you ended which is we are awaiting resolution of our dispute with Kraft and as we come through that, which we now expect for sometime in the second half of this fiscal year, that will bring clarity to allow us to then formulate a little bit more specifically our go-forward plans. But I will say that we are very committed to sustainable dividends and growing the dividends through two metrics. One is by at earnings grow over time, the payout ratio where we have been paying since initiation at 35% to 40% payout ratio; I would expect to grow dividends just as earnings growth. But I would also expect to look at that range over time, not immediately but we are well aware of whether as an industry payout and I would anticipate at elevating that payout ratio at the appropriate time, which I think the strength of our cash flow in the business. Similarly with share repurchases, we are committed to a balance of dividends and repurchases. Of course repurchases are much more opportunistic, but we\u2019re committed  to the program and our Board has authorized continued opportunities for us to being more active in the open markets, so we will take advantage of that as we believe market conditions exist for that. Now with respect to, Jeff what I will tell you is, I\u2019m looking closely at debt on our balance sheet and while we certainly have very, very strong cash flow position, we do recognize that we got opportunities to optimize that balance sheet and bring some additional debt on to leverage over time. And I\u2019m well aware of where the market conditions are today and again looking very closely, we had nothing to announce today, but its definitely something close thing on the radar screen.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, thanks. Just a question on EMEA. If you guys can talk about this thinking on holding on of the company stores there, it\u2019s a business that\u2019s not earning much of a margin today and just wondering, you mentioned some refranchising, but I think that\u2019s for new growth. Just if you revisited the thoughts on refranchising some of the company business to try to pull more profits out of that market?", "Howard Schultz", "Michelle is sitting in London; I think she is going to answer the question.", "Michelle Gass", "Yes. Hi, Jason. Michelle here. Excellent question. Actually Howard spoke to, we\u2019re actually now looking at franchising not only for new growth, but sale of some of our existing base. And we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve begun to do that in London and Africa with some learning, then on U.K we will look for other opportunities across the continents. So to clarify, its not just about new store growth, it is actually by looking at the sale of some of our existing base. And we\u2019re confident that this will dramatically shift the profitability of the market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from UBS. Your line is open.", "David Palmer - UBS", "Hey guys. Congratulations on the quarter. Obviously, unbelievable performance, especially at the core U.S. retail. Last year Starbucks did a $10 card for $5 with living social and I\u2019m not acquainted with all the details on these deals, but that seems that the time to be a way to nudge the sales higher during \u2013 after what was a tough June last year. This year I think you did one with Groupon at the end of March when the retail momentum seems very strong. So I'm wondering if you're doing things like this maybe more strategically as you're trying to think about broadening that rewards user base, or maybe just what were you thinking with these types of things? Thanks.", "Howard Schultz", "It's true that the success that we enjoyed with LivingSocial coupled with the learnings that we had in terms of analyzing it, gave us great confidence that during the right time of the year there was an opportunity to do this again. I think the Starbucks brand and the frequency and the relevancy of the Starbucks experience puts us in the unique position to leverage these kinds of opportunities versus a traditional retailer or restaurant. I think you're exactly right, the momentum in this quarter there was no specific need to be a catalyst, but we felt there's no reason to embrace the status quo. We learnt a great deal from LivingSocial, so we had planned to do it again. I think that Starbucks is in a unique position in that we are a super-premium brand. You don't have to go to Starbucks as a discretionary purchase, but at the same time we've been able to find ways to provide a value proposition throughout the menu system and take advantage of these kinds of offers. When you couple that with the incrementality that we have gotten from our rewards program, we have a new level of analytics that we feel is a significant competitive advantage going forward domestically and internationally, and we're now going to apply that to other channels of distributions specifically the grocery. And I want to go back to one question that was asked earlier about, is in fact the other channels going to be as large as we've said in the past? And no one on this call should doubt whatsoever the commitment we have and the ambition for the multiple channels of distribution to live outside of our stores that will rival the scale of the U.S. business. We have an opportunity as we've demonstrated with VIA, as we've demonstrated with Evolution to introduce products in our stores, create the brand and then draft off that into the grocery channel. These are early, early days but the evidence that we have about what I've just described, coupled with this new level of analytics and the benefit from these loyalty programs gives us great confidence that we have the tools, the resources and the multiple channels of distribution that no other consumer brand or retailer has to do things that have not been done before. And this loyalty program that we're going to launch into CPG is a significant idea both for the consumer and I also should say for the trade that we have been in close contact with. And I'm stunned that no one has asked the question about the CPG opportunity in China. Did you not hear what I said? We are looking at the opportunity to take the CPG business into the largest growing market into the world leveraging the equity of the brand and our 1,000-store retail footprint in China.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Howard, I will \u2013 be a follow-up on that last statement and then another question, if I may.", "Howard Schultz", "Finally.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "How many points of distribution do you think you could have in the CPG market in China? I mean is it like the U.S. in terms of grocery stores? I don't know exactly what the numbers are there?", "Howard Schultz", "I think the type of distribution that we'll ultimately have in Mainland China will be different than the core distribution we have in the U.S. That channel does not have the nationwide grocery businesses. However, the demand for Starbucks coffee and coffee products that we've had from customers and from people interested on the trade side has been growing. And so we believe very strongly that we can take advantage of that. And when we look at products like Bottled Frappuccino and the success of Blended Frappuccino in China, which has been a significant opportunity for us, we think we can leverage Bottled Frappuccino in the same context that we\u2019ve done in the U.S. which is a $1 billion brand. So, this is a big long-term idea and it\u2019s built off the unique trust and confidence and the relevancy of the Starbucks retail brand in China. And for any of you who have been to Mainland China, you\u2019ve seen that the people who are going into our stores in now over 70 cities in China are Chinese nationals who are using our stores in the same way that Starbucks customers have for years in the U.S. They\u2019re drinking Starbucks coffee, they\u2019re drinking espresso beverages and they\u2019re using our stores as an extension of home and work.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Okay. And if I may, follow-up on a slightly different topic. There was, I guess some discussion on the last conference call that in your early quarter sales, your March quarter sales may have been helped by very high Starbucks card redemptions because of the heavy gifting that happened in the December quarter. So, I was hoping that you could, kind of comment whether that was the case, also comment \u2013 I don\u2019t think I saw the number anywhere, what the end of quarter, March quarter Starbucks card balance was and you\u2019re kind of in the thought just \u2013 in case I don\u2019t get, I cut off Troy, if there was anyway that we can tighten up the coffee cost guidance for \u201914 and \u201915 as appropriate they need to be that?", "John Culver", "Well, there is no doubt that we got a boost from the sale of Starbucks holiday cards, following the holiday season. But the one thing that has happened over the course of time is that the velocity of Starbucks card sales are much more significant in the off peak holiday season than ever before, coupled with the fact that we now have a significant spike in other smaller holidays, Mothers Day, Fathers Day, Graduation, Birthdays and Gift giving. So the card itself is growing at over 30% and we expect that we continue and we just \u2013 we\u2019re just getting started with it. I think Troy is going to give you the answer to the other question.", "Troy Alstead", "Yeah, John. Specifically we had on the balance sheet at the end of March, at the end of the second quarter, deferred revenue on the P&L is $668 million. That largely reflects Starbucks card balances as it does in each quarter. And our overall loads during the quarter were 32% higher than the same period time last year. So a couple of metrics that I think tell you two things. One is, the huge up tick in Starbucks card in all forms. Mobile, physical card in a loyalty program in the holiday period very profoundly came through our business in the second quarter. Card overall added roughly two percentage points of the comp growth during the second quarter, very powerful for us and not unlike what we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years that that program has built tremendously. I think as encouraging as anything is the fact that in the second quarter not only will we benefit from that big holiday slew of cards that came back into the stores. We also though turned new card users into loyalty program members that now allows us to connect with there much more meaningfully, and we believe gives us trajectory even more significantly into Q3 and Q4. So the card was very important to us in the quarter. Now specific to your question about coffee cost. We have now purchased a little bit more than or priced -- a little bit more than half of our coffee needs for fiscal \u201914. We have been doing some incremental buying given current market conditions. So we have got about half -- a little bit more than half of our needs locked up for \u201914 and given what we\u2019ve locked as well as visibility we have in the market conditions and how we might price the balance of the year, we expect that as I\u2019ve told you before about $100 million of commodity tailwind we would expect to come through the P&L in fiscal \u201914. That\u2019s the year-over-year benefit in fiscal \u201914. Now we\u2019re not meaningfully priced at all in the fiscal \u201915 yet, but I would just point out that given where the market has been trading and where we believe it will go from here, we\u2019ve got opportunity in fiscal \u201915 to experience another year-over-year commodity tailwind. Not a specific number yet, but it could be a meaningful tailwind coming our way again in fiscal \u201915.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mitchell Speiser from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Great. Thanks very much. And my question is on the food program in general in the U.S. a couple of parts of the question. First, have the same store sales continue to grow quicker in food versus the overall business. And secondly, I sometimes get the pushback where that food is a lower margin product, so as it grows it could hurt margins, but is the offset a higher ticket and kind of how that works? And then the last part of the food question is just on health and wellness and the bakery product looks great, I wouldn't consider it under the umbrella of health and wellness. If you can maybe give us a little sense of where you might be going with health and wellness in the Starbuck stores? Thank you.", "Cliff Burrows", "Thanks, Mitch, for the question. Firstly, we are seeing strong continued growth from food. And that has been the case now from the past 12 months. So really reporting a very strong growth in food in the U.S. Obviously, overall, it's a balance between food and beverage which is really important to us. On the margin, I think the \u2013 we're getting healthy margins out of our food. The opportunity here is if we can increase (indiscernible), which historically has been one in three transactions, vacancy is a big opportunity. The other side is it increases the relevance of Starbucks as a place for people to come to whether it's food on the way to work or indeed for their lunch. So we see that continuing and we'll support increased beverage sales throughout the dayparts as well. So that is part of our strategy on food. If I talk about the health and wellness as it relates to new bakery products, the fantastic thing with those new bakery products is they are all natural ingredients while we're taking out any non-artificial ingredients, we use natural sweetening. That's where we can reduce sugar. So when there is buffering there, finest ingredients, calories are managed both by the balance of those ingredients plus portion size. So that is a good part of it and health and wellness remains an important part of our strategy going forward. And you'll see in the coming months that we'll supplement a lot of launch products with other products which will give that balance. It's important to us for both food and for better customer choice and in all parts of our range of beverage and food to give healthy options.", "Howard Schultz", "And, Mitch, I'd like to just underscore Cliff's point about margins. While food has a lower gross margin than does our beverage platform, on a net margin level, so at the store level, food is actually additive to margin we would expect over time. And the reason for that is if we're selling incremental food and as we will be increasingly successful, we believe that increasing mix of food in our stores, the rent is already paid, the lights are on, staff is in place, our partners are in the stores, so we have an opportunity to very incrementally, perhaps see that impact of gross margin very moderately, but I would expect it to be neutral to most likely positive to margin at the store level.", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley of Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America", "Thank you. Just a question on the China Asia-Pacific operating income performance for the quarter being flat. I know you mentioned making investment in the platform to grow the business, but could you talk a little bit about that for the quarter and what we should \u2013 how should we think about that going forward?", "John Culver", "Joe, this is John Culver. With regards to the operating income and the impact that we saw when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, there are really three things. First was, the portfolio mix shift that [Technical Difficulty] fact that more and more of our growth is coming from our company-operated markets, and in particular China. So, in the quarter, as Troy mentioned, we grew store count 35% on a year-over-year basis. The second big item that hit us was this non-routine income and Troy quoted that at $6.7 million. That was the joint venture income that we took last year in the quarter\u2026", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. I apologize but there is a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold and the conference will resume momentarily. Thank you for your patience. ", "Howard Schultz", "This is Starbucks. We're back on the call, operator.", "Operator", "Your line is open.", "Howard Schultz", "Do we have a question?", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America", "Hi, Howard, this is Joe Buckley, I don't know if you can hear me, but we can hear you but John got cutoff\u2026", "Howard Schultz", "John, do you want to take another shot at that?", "John Culver", "Yeah. So, with regards to the operating income and what we saw in the quarter, there are really three factors playing into it. First, with the portfolio mix shift and the fact that more and more of our growth is coming from our company-owned markets. The second big piece was the investment that we continue to make in accelerating new store growth. And as Troy shared with you, we grew our new store base over 35% on the year-over-year basis. At the same time while we make those investments, we continue to see very strong returns from a sale to investment ratio. And those metrics continue to exceed our expectations. And then the last big item, which was a non-routine item, was some joint venture income that we have to lap over from last year. It was an accounting adjustment that took place last year. It was a $6.7 million accounting adjustment in the quarter and that was the other big non-routine item that we had to lap over for the year.", "Howard Schultz", "We take one more question, JoAnn?", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Yes, one more question please, operator.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco from Lazard. Your line is open.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Mike, please (indiscernible) please.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Michael Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Great, thanks. This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. Just wonder if you can talk about the consumer habits a little bit, that you\u2019re seeing for people that aren\u2019t using the Starbucks card. I thought I heard something mentioned about those users purchasing premium beverages and alike. So I'm just wondering kind of what the spending habits look like when people aren\u2019t using the preloaded money? Thanks.", "Troy Alstead", "I will try and answer that Mike. What we are trying to come by was that we were seeing incrementality in terms of the afternoon daypart from cardholders and also we are seeing an increase in their purchasing of the indulgent beverages. We were not making and I certainly didn't intend to make any inference about the changing habits of customers who pay by other means and they remain a \u2013 the majority of our customers and they remain very consistent in their habits.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you very much. We wind up today for our second quarter earnings call. We appreciate your time and we will talk to you again Q3 call in July. Thank you.

Howard?", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. I\u2019m very pleased to discuss the record Q4 and fiscal 2013 results that Starbucks reported today. Q4 capped off what was without question the best year in Starbucks 42 year history, driven by robust innovation and disciplined operating and financial performance across each of our business segments and virtually around the world.", "Continued strong comparable store sales growth of 8% in each of our Americas and China Asia-Pacific regions in Q4 combined with positive comps of 2% in EMEA to produce global comp store sales of 7% marking our 15th consecutive quarter of comp growth in excess of 5%, despite continued challenging economic and consumer headwinds in many of the global markets we serve.", "Starbucks consolidated Q4 revenue rose 13% to a record $3.8 billion while operating leverage and a continued focus on controlling expenses enabled us to expand our operating margin to a full 220 basis points over last year to a quarterly record of 17.6%. And outstanding execution across the company enabled us to deliver record Q4 EPS of $0.63 a share to our shareholders, a full 37% over last year\u2019s Q4 and the highest EPS of any single quarter in the 42 year history of our Company.", "For the full fiscal 2013 Starbucks increased revenues by 12% to a record $14.9 billion, expanded its operating margin 150 basis points to a record 16.5% and draw a 26% increase in EPS to a record $2.26 per share.

Let me tell you we\u2019re just getting started. I believe that fiscal 2013 will prove to be an inflexion point and a spring board to even greater opportunity and success in the future because of the strategic fly wheel we introduced June-July through which we leverage our global store footprint, growing CPG presence in world class digital and mobile assets is driving performance in gaining increased momentum.", "I will provide a brief overview of segment performance in Q4 and then turn the call over to John Culver, Group President of Starbucks Coffee China, Asia Pacific and Channel Development and Emerging Brands to provide detail on those key businesses. Then Troy will take you through the financials in detail and provide you with an update on our fiscal \u201914 outlook.", "Let me pause and congratulate Troy as I look to him, on his promotion to Group President, Global Business Services in addition to his ongoing role and responsibility as CFO. Thank you Troy for your leadership, our 20 year partnership and for the tremendous contributions you\u2019ve made to the business as CFO over the last five years.", "Now turning to the Americas. The momentum we reported in Starbucks Americas segment in Q3 continued in Q4, with a stunning 8% comp growth driven by a 5% increase in traffic and a 3% lift in ticket. Noteworthy is that the 8% comp growth recorded in the U.S in Q4 an amazing accomplishment given the size and maturity of the store base we\u2019re comping against, representing our 15 consecutive quarter of U.S comp growth in excess of 7% and that many of our over 2,000 new renovated or relocated U.S stores were the strongest performers.", "Strong performance in both our U.S and rapidly growing Latin American businesses contribute to a 11% increase in total Q4 Americas revenue to a record $2.8 billion. Having just returned from a market visit to Canada, a great Starbucks market with over 1,300 stores where I witnessed first hand deep passionate sense of mission that our partners are bringing to their customers and the communities they serve and the strong leadership provided by Annie Young-Scrivner, President of Starbucks Canada is bringing to the market. In Q4 we recorded the strongest comp growth in Canada in 13 quarters, helping us exceed $1 billion of full year revenues in that market for the first time ever.", "Building on a strong summer sales, in September the Americas region kicked off for its Fall promotional calendar with what has become our most popular seasonal beverage ever, Pumpkin Spice Latte. 2013 marks the 10th anniversary of PSL with customers having purchased more than 200 million PSL beverages since launch.", "Despite the proliferation of Knock Off and Copycat, sales of Starbucks PSL beverages are as strong as ever and once again exceeding expectations as customers continue to embrace the quality of the original Starbucks PSL.", "Also in September we debuted a new single-origin coffee from Ethiopia, the birth place of coffee and in recognition of our 42 year history are purchasing Colombian coffee and our plans to open our first store in Colombia next year, we introduced Colombia Caldas, a wonderful Starbucks Reserve.", "Recently we launched a national marketing campaign around coffee entitled Starbucks Higher Arabica standards that will benefit both our retail stores and CPG businesses. These initiatives underscore Starbucks ongoing commitment to bringing the world\u2019s most rare and exotic coffee for our customers and to constantly reaffirming our coffee leadership and authority worldwide.", "In Q4, we also made solid progress against our plans to expand our La Boulange baked goods platform. La Boulange products are now available in more than 3,500 Starbucks stores in the U.S and we\u2019re now on track off for La Boulange in all 7,000 company operated stores in the U.S by the end of fiscal 2014.", "Food continues to be an important component of our growth strategy and we\u2019re extremely encouraged by both customer response to La Boulange and the sales lift we\u2019re seeing over the food products La Boulange we placed.

Starbucks handcrafted carbonated beverages, in Atlanta and Austin as well as in Japan and Singapore. These efforts are part of a larger plan to enter and innovate in the cold, carbonation industry and over $100 billion global category by leveraging our unique customized beverage retail platform expertise to deliver innovation and personalization to customers like no other industry participant ever has.", "Customer response to our carbonation innovation has been encouraging and we look forward to sharing more details around our plans for cold, carbonation in the months ahead. Stay tuned.", "And beginning this Friday, we will begin rolling out Starbucks holiday beverages in our iconic red cups, a new Gingerbread Latte recipe and the Savory La Boulange Almond Croissant will join a wide variety of other innovative and delicious offerings that promise to make this holiday and winter season our most exciting and successful year.", "Turning to the EMEA region, I\u2019m very pleased to report that the early progress we began to see in our Europe, Middle East and African region in Q3 continued to Q4, with positive 2% comp growth in the second consecutive quarter. As I\u2019ve previously shared with you the leverage and learning from our U.S transformation combined with strong leadership in the region are driving beverage and food innovation in efforts to elevate enhance the customer experience across the region as we open our 2,000 EMEA store this quarter.", "We're particularly encouraged by the solid performance we saw in the U.K., our single largest market in the region, supporting our view that an early turnaround in EMEA may be underway and that we are moving down the correct path for sustained profitability. We also opened 34 new license and franchise stores in Q4, early progress against our plans to add more license and franchise stores in our EMEA portfolio.", "Let me now turn it to Channel Development and Emerging Brands. John will be providing an update on our fast growing Channel Development and Emerging Brands business. There are a few noteworthy highlights I'd like to share with you. We have already exceeded the aggressive growth plans we laid out for Evolution Fresh upon acquiring the business and brand in November 2011. A wide selection of fresh healthy Evolution Fresh juices are now available in more than 8,000 Starbucks and grocery retailer whole cases [ph] and almost all Whole Foods locations nationwide.", "Earlier this month, we reached a big milestone with the opening of our new state-of-the-art juicery in California. The new juicery will have 190 Starbucks partners and quadruple our capacity to reduce Evolution Fresh brand cold-pressed juices and enable us to accelerate our plan to significantly increase our share of the $1.6 billion super premium juice category.", "As I said in the past the category of tea, a $90 billion global industry that is right for innovation is another major strategic opportunity for us to that leverages all of our core capabilities and existing infrastructure. We are making significant progress against our plans to integrate, develop and expand the Teavana retail platform. Last week we were in New York City for the grand opening of a reimagined Teavana Fine Tea and Tea Bar store on the Upper East Side and be followed by a second store in Seattle [indiscernible] shortly.", "The store in New York is stunning but beyond the ascetics, the reimagined Teavana store brings the romance and theater of handcrafted beverages to the tea category like never before. We are convinced that with Teavana, Starbucks can reinvent and do for tea just what we have done for coffee and that we can grow and expand the tea industry and the Tea Bar concept by introducing the wide, innovative array of handcrafted tea beverages, tea inspired food and world-class tea merchandize. With the tea being our larger opportunity than coffee outside of the U.S. and Canada, we see a future with Teavana stores across North America and around the world.", "[indiscernible] Teavana with the company's unmatched knowledge and authority around all things tea, then we learned about Teavana's extraordinary tea sourcing expertise and capabilities. In the quarters ahead you will see how we are expanding and deepening the presence of high quality Teavana branded teas within the Starbucks stores in order to leverage tea as a driver of additional customer occasions creating wide recognition for the Teavana brand and adding another layer of growth within the Starbucks stores. The opportunity to innovate within the global tea category is significant and we are poised to bring an unparallel retail experience to customers around the world.", "Let me turn to mobile, digital and loyalty. Perhaps no single competency and capability is enabling us to elevate and amplify the Starbucks brand and to deliver an enhanced Starbucks' experience for our customers more than our global leadership position and continued investment in mobile, digital and loyalty innovations and technologies and no single competency is more important to the success of our proprietary strategic [indiscernible] that is adding so much value to the Starbucks brand and our financial performance.", "Fiscal 2013 was another significant record year for our card program with over $4 billion loaned in globally and nearly one-third of all North American store tender paid with a service card. At the same time our loyalty program expansion continued around the world including 11 significant new markets including Germany, Hong Kong and the Philippines. We've also begun integrating our emerging brands and adding a number of exciting new features to the My Starbucks Rewards program. Members can now early redeem My Starbucks Rewards stars in Teavana stores and reading [ph] stars for Evolution Fresh juices and other bottled Starbucks ready-to-drink beverages in Starbucks stores, all of which further leverage our world-class card and mobile payment programs providing enhanced value to our customers.", "Today with 11% of our U.S. and Canada in-store transitions being paid for with a mobile device, Starbucks is far away the clear leader in mobile payment. We are encouraged by how our customers have fully embraced our mobile apps as the most convenient way to pay, reload and keep track of their loyalty rewards. With the current average of over 4 million mobile transactions per week and more than 8 million customers using our mobile app, Starbucks mobile platforms are fast growing customer touch points. Through them we are communicating with and delivering innovation to our customers in a way that no other retailer can and on the horizon, our enhancement to our mobile apps that include mobile ordering and digital tipping are on its way.", "As we enter the last two months of our calendar 2013, we do so with exciting plans for Veteran's Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday shopping season that we know will delight our customers and further add to our operational and financial momentum. Considering there's never been a more exciting or more important time for our company. I'd like to conclude by congratulating and thanking my 200,000 fellow partners who proudly wear the green apron for the [indiscernible] results we've achieved in 2013 and extending my heartfelt appreciation to them for all they do for our customers all around the world every day.", "I want to close on a very personal note. Fiscal 2013 was the year in which Starbucks recorded record financial and operating performance. It was also a year in which we delivered record value to our shareholders with over $20 billion increases in market cap alone. For the record of which I'm particularly proud of is that in fiscal 2013 our partners, our employees realized also over $230 million in value as a result of the commitment we made over 20 years ago to link returns to our shareholders and rewards to our people as well by providing equity in the company for all of our full and part-time workers who work more than 20 hours a week.", "It is evident that 25 years ago when we set out to build a great enduring company, we said we want to achieve the balance between profitability and a social conscience by sharing our success with our people, by providing a great opportunity for our customers and doing everything we can to enhance the communities we are doing business with. This has been a phenomenal year, a stunning year for our company and for all those at Starbucks it is with great pride that we present Q4 and year-end results to you. John.", "John Culver", "Thank you, Howard. 2013 was indeed an extraordinary year for Starbucks and I couldn't be more proud for the significant role for the China and Asia-Pacific region and the Channel Development business is playing in our overall success. I'll begin with the incredibly charmed results for cap, Starbucks' fastest growing region with 13 countries, close to 4,000 stores and nearly 70,000 partners serving 11 million customers every week. As you can see from our results the growth throughout the region continues to be a meaningful component of the Starbucks overall story.", "For the quarter I'm very pleased to share that the region is reporting record results in three key areas; total revenue, total operating income and new stores opened. In the fourth quarter revenue grew a very healthy 29% reaching 256 million which was driven by 8% comp growth and the opening of 588 net new stores in the year. This store growth represents a 31% increase over the prior year.", "In the fourth quarter we delivered 96 million in operating income which represents a 46% increase over the prior year. Operating margin increased to 37.5%, a 440 basis point improvement over last year. This was driven by a combination of strong sales leverage, lower operating costs and a reduction to our estimated asset retirement obligations on certain store leases.", "Today, we have a very well balanced portfolio of company-operated, joint venture and licensed markets led by China and Japan and these results demonstrate the strength of the Starbucks brand and the relevancy we are gaining with our customers across the region. We continue to take a holistic approach to building the Starbucks brand in our markets while making the necessary investments ahead of the curve that will fuel our future growth.", "We now have localized capabilities in the region not only in store operations, real estate and marketing in category but also on the critical areas of store design, R&D, supply chain and IT. Coupled with the recent announcement of Jeff Hansberry as President for the region, we\u2019re now in a position to integrate channel development into our markets and expand the Starbucks footprint beyond our retail stores.", "In the quarter we reached two significant milestones. We opened our 1000 stores in both China and Japan. The stores that we are building today across the region are some of the most unique and innovative store designs we have anywhere in the world. This is highlighted by the most recent opening of our two newest flagship stores in Beijing. These stores are designed to elevate the coffee experience for our customers and to further enhance and differentiate the third place experience from anything else that exists in the market.", "Digital also continues to be a huge opportunity and focus for us in the region. We have now introduced the Starbucks Card in the aspects of our loyalty program in 11 of the 13 countries we operate in. We are seeing significant transaction with the card program in all markets as it now accounts for 23% of tender across the region. From a customer perspective our satisfaction and quality stores are achieving record levels. The frequency of our customer business continues to increase and we continue to attract new customers into our stores reflected by a 6% increase in transactions for the quarter.", "Turning to China, we have been humbled by the way in which our customers embrace the Starbucks experience and recognize that we must continue to earn their trust and respect each and every day. We have seen first hand that Starbucks is increasingly becoming a daily ritual for local Chinese. Key drivers for this have been our innovative store designs, local product innovations and the My Starbucks Rewards program where in just two short years we built a base of over 3 million members and it is now grown to account for 35% of transactions in our stores.", "For the year we opened 317 new stores in China and the initial performance of those new stores is very strong. The stores we opened in 2012 are currently averaging sales in excess of $700,000, while our 2013 classes stores are on track to annualize with a very similar result. Not surprisingly China will again be the largest driver of the approximately 750 new stores we plan to open across the region in 2014.", "Beyond China we are accelerating growth in every other market. I\u2019m particularly encouraged by our strong results and future growth opportunities in key geographies including Japan, Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. And I would like to also congratulate our India partners on the one year anniversary of the market. Through our relationship with Tata, we have opened 25 stores and the response of our customers has been nothing short of amazing which gives us tremendous optimism for the future growth prospects for this market.", "Finally, we have a very long runway for growth across the region based on the foundation we have built for our brand and the investments we continue to make. And I remain extremely confident in our ability to drive strong comparable store growth or balancing the rapid expansion of our new store footprint well into the future.", "As optimistic as I am about the future growth opportunity we have in cap, I\u2019m just as excited about the long-term opportunity for our channel development business. With fiscal 2013 revenue of $1.4 billion, operating income of more than $400 million a very robust operating margin near 30% and a portfolio of market leading products, channel development has become a meaningful contributor to Starbucks results and is directly benefiting from the strategic flywheel as Howard mentioned earlier.", "In the fourth quarter, channel development grew revenue by 13% to $361 million. At the same time operating income of $128 million grew more than two times faster than revenue in Q4, accelerating to 30% growth on the benefit of lower coffee cost and leverage from our strong top line growth.", "In Q4 we were able to stabilize and grow dollar and pound share in 11 of the 13 weeks for our premium roast and ground package coffee. This was due in part of the list price reduction we took in May. We are also encouraged by the synergy we are creating with the emerging growth drivers such as linking the My Starbucks Reward program to our package coffee business where our customers have earned more than 1.5 million stars since launch.", "We also continue to work with key retailers to increase our presence with the Starbucks Signature Aisle. Already in 100 grocery stores today and with plans to reach 400 by the end of the fiscal year Signature Aisle quantitatively elevates our brand while enhancing the customer experience. The combination of value, rewards and our premium positioning will allow us to continue our leadership position in premium package coffee.", "Additionally premium single-serve continues to drive accelerated growth for the business with Starbucks K-Cup growing sales 42% in the prior 13 week period. We have a very diverse portfolio of K-Cup offerings that gives us the premium leadership position down the aisle. In the quarter we added vanilla and caramel flavored coffee to our K-Cup lineup and we will continue to bring new flavors and varieties to the market through our expanded relationship with Green Mountain in 2014.", "It's now been a year since we launched Verismo and we\u2019re looking forward to another successful holiday season. This year we have significantly increased the number of doors we will be in for the holidays, introduce the new machine with a fresh design and functionality and are offering several new skews to drive the success of this platform. We remain very optimistic about the large and growing opportunity we have to expand Starbucks beyond our retail stores given the performance of the business throughout 2013.", "For competition down the aisle continues to increase, both in terms of the emergence of the value segment and increased promotional activity in the coffee category overall we are in a position to win. Although we may experience volatility quarter-to-quarter, we will continue to elevate our brand through market leading innovation, strong cross channel rewards which leverages our MSR program and meaningful value and differentiation. Make no mistake, we are committed to delivering double-digit top and bottom line growth for this segment in 2014 and beyond.", "In closing, I\u2019m incredibly proud and want to thank and recognize all of our partners throughout China and Asia Pacific and within our channel development business for the significant contributions they have made to the overall success of the Company. It is through their efforts that we have been able to deliver these record results and it's why we believe we are poised and positioned to capture the tremendous opportunity we have in front of us.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Troy. Troy.", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, John. Let\u2019s turn now to the America segment where the fourth quarter represents an impressive continuation of the strength delivery in Q3. Revenue growth of 11% was driven by 8% of comp growth including 5% lift in transactions. And as the case has been for quite some time now there were a diverse set drivers behind the growth. In the U.S. food continues to boost our sales adding about two percentage points to comp in the quarter. That is a result of gains in both the tax rate and favorable mix in both lunch and bakery items. Food is a key driver behind our strength in the lunch hours of 11am to 1pm our fastest growth apart and the one with the highest incremental profit potential.", "Pumpkin Spice platform now in its 10th year once again delivered strong growth. Additionally our focus on summer refreshment and ice beverages was a success. Those promotions combined for one point of comp. Treat Receipt was a hit again this year with 16% higher redemption rate than last year, and as a result of the favorable mix shift in food as well as recent pricing actions, ticket growth contributed three percentage points to comp in Q4 its highest contribution in two years.", "While food was the single largest driver of U.S. comp in Q4, La Boulange is just 15% of our stores for the entire quarter does not yet have the reach to contribute meaningfully. It has, however, been very meaningful in stores that carry it which is encouraging to us as we proceed with the rollout. Profitability remains strongly in the Americas as operating income grew 16% to $606 million in Q4 with operating margin expanding 100 basis points to 21.8%. Sales leverage continues to be the primary driver of margin expansion in the Americas.", "In Europe, Middle East and Africa, fourth quarter results demonstrated the improvement that has been building over the past two years. EMEA revenue grew to 3% driven by an increase in the number of licensed stores and sales growth within them. Our largest licensed markets in EMEA are among the best performing including the Middle East and Russia. We were also able to sustain 2% comp growth in our company-operated EMEA markets despite a still challenging macro environment.", "Profitability continues to improve in EMEA as well with Q4 operating income reaching $27 million, the highest level of full year income since we started reporting EMEA as a separate segment in 2010. Our ongoing store portfolio optimization effort which we embarked upon a year ago has been greatly important in several ways. We brand [ph] our store development with licensees adding stores that are delivering excellent sales, strong profitability and high return on capital. We refocused our efforts on company-operated stores to those with a strong combination of excellent real estate, a practical cost structure and demographics that support sales levels that drive profitability.", "This optimization [indiscernible] closure of 72 underperforming stores and relicensing 24 more in the past five quarters. This program coupled with a renewed focus on operations and the customer experience has helped drive transaction comp growth higher by 5 and by 3 percentage points respectively the past two quarters. Work in the past year has also enhanced margins in EMEA with 9.3% operating margin reported in Q4 was the highest we've achieved in 12 quarters and we continue to make progress on our target by improving profitability each year finishing fiscal 2013 at 5.5% up from 0.6% last year. We have made real progress on our long-term cash to the mid teens margin in this region.", "Across all our other segments which includes Teavana, Evolution Fresh, [indiscernible] Coffee and our digital ventures business, revenue more than doubled to $105 million driven largely by the inclusion of Teavana revenue beginning in Q2; both in our digital ventures business and Evolution Fresh also contributed. The net operating loss of our other segments was $17 million in Q4 as we continue to invest in our emerging brands. The strong revenue and margin growth in all our businesses led outstanding consolidated results in the fourth quarter. Net revenue grew 13% to $3.8 billion, strong global comp store of 7% comprised of 5% transaction growth and 2% ticket growth were the key driver.", "The addition of 1,701 netting stores globally including 356 Teavana stores over the past year and strengthened license stores in Channel Development also contributed to the revenue growth. Consolidated operating income of $669 million grew 29% over the last Q4 more than doubling the revenue growth rate. This led to record operating margin of 17.6%, an expansion of 220 basis points over last year. Strong sales leverage contributed 90 basis points of favorability with the EMEA portfolio optimization adding 60 basis points and lower commodity costs adding 50 basis points. Earnings per share of $0.63 grew to 37% over last Q4.", "As I indicated to you in July the fourth quarter included a $0.03 gain on the sale of our equity in Argentina and Chile which will enable further growth and enhanced profitability for both parties in these markets. Even without this $0.03 gain, EPS will accelerate in each quarter throughout fiscal '13 demonstrating the momentum we have translating our strong top line into significant bottom line growth.", "For the full fiscal year 2013, our results were equally impressive. Consolidated net revenue reached $14.9 billion, 12% higher than in 2012. 7% lower comp growth in 2013 was the largest driver and was our fourth consecutive year at or above that mark. Transactions grew by 5% for the year while average ticket grew to 2%. Consolidated operating income grew to a record $2.5 billion in fiscal '13, an increase of 23% over fiscal '12. We also delivered record operating margin in 2013 of 16.5%, a full 150 basis points higher than last year. Leverage on our record sales and 50 basis points of commodity cost favorability were the key drivers.", "The strong revenue growth coupled with excellent margin improvement led record earnings per share of $2.26 in fiscal '13. This represents growth of 26% over the prior year and included $0.03 each in the second and fourth quarters for gains on the sale of equity in Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Globally we had 1,701 net new stores in fiscal '13 and of course is more geographically diverse than ever before. For instance, in 2007, our largest year of store growth ever, U.S. accounted for 70% of new stores.", "By contrast in 2013 the U.S. accounted for just over 20% in new stores. This ability is allowing us to be selective on real estate while celebrating growth, ultimately enhancing return on capital. The strong business results we delivered in fiscal '13 had culminated in total cash generation. This has been critical in allowing us to reinvest in the business while [indiscernible] the increase in cash return to shareholders. For the year we returned a record $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Additionally, today we announced that our Board has approved a 24% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share. This aligns with our commitment to increasing shareholder returns which includes growing dividends. As part of that commitment we have increased our targeted dividend payout ratio range now 35% to 45%.", "Over the past several years and again in 2013, we've demonstrated the innovative capabilities and operational excellence to drive strong and consistent comparable store sales growth. We demonstrated the ability to accelerate new store development while also increasing return on capital. We've demonstrated a vision to [indiscernible] for the future in our channel development and emerging brand businesses. We've demonstrated the ability to expand operating margins and consistently drive earnings growth faster than revenue growth and we demonstrated the ability to deliver earnings above our targeted range [indiscernible] for growth.", "As we close 2013 and look ahead, the strength of our fiscal 2013 results further increases our confidence in our ability to deliver another strong year. [indiscernible] 2014 outlook and as you then subsequently establish your own expectations for our financial performance in the coming year, I would ask you to both recognize the strength and consistently of our historical performance as well as recognize the challenge of the task ahead, the challenge of again driving store comp growth through this large system, the challenge of again expanding margins after several years of driving margins higher, the challenge of overcoming increased interest expense and a higher tax rate.", "We are more optimistic about our future than ever before and at the same time we're realistic and practical in our expectations and I would encourage you to be as well. Targeting revenue growth in 2014 of 10% or greater driven by local comp growth in mid single digits and continued growth in channel development.", "Now let me clarify a misunderstanding about our revenue guidance. That revenue growth target is no different from the guidance we provided last quarter. The 10% of greater just recognizes that we have great confidence that we can consistently drive [indiscernible] top line growth in the short term as well as the long term. Now as we said last quarter and on heels [ph] of phenomenal global comp growth in the third and again in the fourth quarter that level of high single digit comp growth [indiscernible] accomplishment for a system as large and mature as Starbucks.", "We strongly believe that we have the innovation pipeline, customer trust and loyalty and operational capabilities to continue to sustainably drive same-store sales and equally strong we believe that the mid single digit level is challenging and achievable. As we move into the new fiscal year it would unreasonable to plan for or set expectations any higher.", "Also contributing to our revenue growth in fiscal '14 will be our planned 1,300 net new stores. China and Asia-Pacific is now targeted to open 750 net new stores with approximately two-thirds have been licensed. EMEA is now targeted for 150 net new openings especially all licensed. We continue to anticipate opening 600 net new stores in the Americas with approximately high licensed.", "Full year consolidated operating margin is expected to expand by 150 to 200 basis points at fiscal '14 as we continue to drive leverage on our strong revenue growth as well as recognize the benefit of lower coffee cups as we expect moderate improvement in operating margin driven by strong sales leverage. In EMEA we anticipate operating margin percentage reached single digits driven by the benefit of the portfolio actions taken in fiscal '13 as well as continued performance and improvements.", "In cap we anticipate operating margin moving towards the low 30% range and our rapid growth continues to shift away from our historically licensed model. In channel development, lower coffee cups will provide a modest operating margin expansion in fiscal '14. Our strong revenue growth in margin expansion target gives us confidence in targeted earnings per share in the range of 255 to 265 in fiscal \u201914. We are targeting EPS in the range of $0.67 to $0.69 in the first quarter with $0.54 to $0.55 targeted for quarter two, a traditionally lower quarter due to seasonality.", "Contributing to the EPS growth will be another year of tail winds on coffee costs, still expected adding approximately $0.09 to $0.10 net benefit for the year. This benefit is expected to be spread evenly throughout the year and reflects the gross coffee impact partially offset by the recent pricing reduction in CPG as well as routine investments in the business.", "We now have the vast majority of our coffee needs locked for fiscal \u201914 and have begun selective buying of certain varietals in to fiscal \u201915. Perhaps one additional comment regarding coffee, I sometimes hear speculation as Starbucks might -- significantly more from favorable coffee costs in 2014. Given that we\u2019re essentially fully price protected now, our price reduction in CPG was executed earlier this year and our other offsetting investments throughout the business are fully planned in various stages of implementation. I would encourage all of you to take close attention to my coffee guidance just provided and not create expectations of winning more than the $0.09 to $0.10 net benefit.", "Capital expenditures in fiscal \u201914 are expected to remain flat with the previous year at approximately $1.2 billion. Continued investment in store renovation, new stores and other retail initiatives will continue to comprise majority of the spend. We anticipate resolution for the suit with Kraft before the end of this calendar year and believe we have adequate liquidity to cover any outcome.", "And finally our cash rate in fiscal 2014 is expected to increase to 34.5%. This is meaningfully higher than fiscal \u201913 which included non-routine benefits from prior year audits and state tax true-ups. At our Investor Conference last December, I summarize 2012 in one word, execution. For 2013 strong execution again led to outstanding financial performance. Record revenues in all our segments, margin growth in all our segments, comp growth at the top of our peer set, more than $1 billion in cash return to shareholders, across the board 2013 was truly the year to remember.", "With all the success in 2013, the best is still in front of us. Our stores are in excellent shape. We\u2019ve renovated nearly half of our stores in the U.S over the past two years. Our product line up is deep with premium coffee at the core and new high quality food, juice and tea to compliment it. Loyalty is on the rise and new technologies continue to enhance the customer experience.", "Our growth appetite remains large and opportunity abounds in China, India, Latin America and with licensed partners globally. And our financial discipline remains strong as we balance height, return, investments in our business while increasing return to shareholders.", "With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Mike?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "Great. Thank you very much. I actually had two quick questions on the Americas. One is, I think with respect to La Boulange, the last time we heard from you said they react -- the response from customers has been phenomenal and I just wanted to see, if you could give us either a quantification or qualitatively East Coast versus West Coast in terms of contribution. And then the other piece is on the margin. I\u2019m surprised the Americas margin tied into -- is it from moderate expansion because I would think on strong comps and some coffee benefit and then mix shift towards license we would see -- we see better expansion than just moderate. Can you give a sense of what investments or offsets you might be making? Thanks.", "Troy Alstead", "Sara, I\u2019ll take the margin question first and then I will hand over to Cliff to talk about La Boulange. First, on the size and skill of a U.S business has big and profitable and as many stores as they we\u2019re very pleased that we can commit to the kind of margin expansion -- in fact deliver the kind of margin expansion we have over the years, again in fiscal \u201913, again in Q4 and again promising in fiscal 2014. So we\u2019re quite pleased with our ability to deliver that comp growth into stronger growth on the bottom line. Recall that coffee benefit does not have meaningful impact on our store segment. So the Americas and the U.S does not get a significant benefit from the coffee tailwind that primarily lands in our channel development business. So that\u2019s the first thing to remember.", "And then beyond that as we\u2019ve significantly elevated margins over the years, I\u2019d anticipate our ability to continue to slowly and moderately over time raise the profitability you got system, which is recognize how far its come already in a short period of time. Cliff?", "Cliff Burrows", "Yes, thanks Sara. La Boulange, we are seeing incredible excitement around the new product. It is showing up really well in store and we\u2019ve achieved in the last nine months what we didn\u2019t achieve in the previous 20 years around food. So the quality East coast, West coast, every market, we\u2019re launching in we\u2019re getting a real passion around it from our teams in stores and customer reaction is superb. That said, we\u2019re still in the early days we\u2019ve launched in 3.5000 stores. We will complete that rollout in the next 12 months and we will be able then to see that meaningful contribution is making. But wherever we launched it and particularly around the pastry, the croissant, the chocolate croissant we\u2019re seeing a huge difference in experience, the customers are getting. We continue to refine the range. We continue to refine our operations in store, but it is elevated in a whole experience and it really is a testament to the investment we\u2019ve made in La Boulange to help us grow a capability around food, I\u2019m really excited for the future.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Hello?", "Howard Schultz", "Hello. Go ahead Jeff.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Thanks. Two quick questions as well. One just from a cash usage perspective, Troy you talked about the share purchase and dividend, I\u2019m just wondering how the Board evaluates or balances between the repurchase and the dividend in terms of -- you boost the payout ratio and if you could just tie that in with the 750 million of leverage you guys just took on whether it\u2019s opportunity for more leverage or better yet, what\u2019s the appropriate debt level that you guys think the system can handle?", "Troy Alstead", "Sure. Let me speak to that Jeff. First of all, in terms of how we evaluate repurchases versus dividends, we\u2019re committed as a company to return cash through both avenues. Dividends of course will be much more sustainable and routine and we\u2019re very, very fortunate in our business to have healthy and consistent cash flow that has rapidly grown over time and which we anticipate will continue growing as we go forward. That\u2019s given us confidence both to grow our dividend rate faster than our rate of earnings as we \u2013 as I announced today in terms of what our Board has approved, but also to give us flexibility over time to expand that payout ratio higher, which is also we announced today. Share repurchases are also important to us, but we will always be a bit more opportunistic as there are plenty of times when we as a company are blacked out of the market or updating our plan. So I would expect repurchases to over the course of any three or four, five quarter period of time to be a component of our cash return not unlike its been over the past few years. But there will always be quarters where it\u2019s higher rather than lower and vice versa. In terms of debt levels, its -- I would suggest you that in our history we tended to be a bit underleveraged and we recognized some opportunity, particularly given where the market conditions have been over the past year to bring a little bit more debt under the balance sheet and to enhance our liquidity. So we\u2019ve done that. That still leaves us, we believe with a very strong credit rating which we intend to maintain and capacity within that credit rating over time if opportunity warrants and market conditions warrant to bring on more debt. So let me be clear, we\u2019ve no immediate plans to do anything more than that $750 million offering that we just placed.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "And if I could follow up, you mentioned just the coffee costs being a 100% locked. Just wondering whether you\u2019re seeing any unusual or irrational behavior from peers with the very favorable coffee costs than -- or maybe better yet. Internally how you guys think about price to be taken or whether using value to drive traffic when coffee costs are so favorable?", "Troy Alstead", "Well, at times because our -- many of our peers buy shorter term than we do and frankly are chasing us often. So I would suggest trying to catch up with -- catch us with whatever pricing actions they can take. Sometimes we see those actions down the aisle. Frankly and perhaps even in competing coffee stores around the country. Frankly that tends to be less of a driver of our own action particularly in the stores as does, [ph] plus pricing to meet customer need. Now down the aisle it is much more competitive and reacting to that marketplace we took a price reduction earlier this year. We believe that positioned us very nicely and I would suggest that the Q4 results for our Channel Development business that we just released today underscore that we did the right thing with pricing action that we are now competing nicely again down the aisle. We're positioned well and we strongly believe not only by competing on price but on innovation, packaging, about the leadership we can bring down the aisle, all those things will contribute to our ability to continue to hold and grow share over time in all forms of consumption.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair", "Hi. Good afternoon. I was hoping to touch a little bit more on the food in the Americas. If you can update us on where food ended as a percent of sales for fiscal '13 versus '12? And then Troy if you could help us think through the impact of the increased food penetration as we think of the pushes and pulls in the Americas gross margin for 2014, I'm understanding the new food is higher margin than the old food but probably still lower margin than coffee. So just if you could talk through that?", "Troy Alstead", "Yes. On margin first, Sharon, what I would say is that over time there were a few dynamics that happened as we grow our food business which we believe still continue to be a significant opportunity for us and we've been experiencing that as food has been a [indiscernible] driver of comp growth this year as you heard from us each quarter recently. With that said and you netted all the pushes and pulls of profit margin and distribution, the efficiencies we get in the back office, the weak management initiatives that we do from our stores, all those things in the long term we believe negate each other and we don't think that there will be meaningful movement whatsoever in gross margin. Yes, food is a moderately lower product gross margin than is beverage but remember as we sell more food to an existing system, it is extremely accretive to percent margins not just to mention dollar margins at the bottom line of the store and highly profitable for the store profitability and return of capital in that existing asset we have with our store systems. So the economics top to bottom are very, very good for us. In terms of food mix, food remains right around 19% of sales mix of our stores. There's some upper movement over that over time, but again huge base of business we have and I think that will be a slow and moderate progression reaching next toward 20 and we think ultimately a bit higher.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs", "I wanted to ask about La Boulange as well and the first is, can you talk to any food book constraints that may have developed in your stores as well a bit out and whether you've come to the conclusion that you may need to flex that a bit to keep the stores moving? And then also on La Boulange you talked about extending it to lunch for next fall and I was curious if you could talk us through what makes sense for lunch at Starbucks and what doesn't?", "Cliff Burrows", "Yes, thanks Michael. It's Cliff. In terms of what we're seeing on the La Boulange operation, it's obviously new. We're investing in La Boulange launch as we can share these fantastic new products with our customers and once we're through that launch phase it becomes part of our operation, it's not about adding labor, it's just being very deliberate and how we deploy our labor. The customers are already there and we're obviously trying to move the percentage of customers who buy our food on a regular basis, we're going to increase that. The opportunity is significant. We're already serving the customers. And give you an example. I was in New York which is one of those recent markets we launched those there last week. I was extremely plaintiff I saw in terms of customer engagement, the way the partners are embracing La Boulange routines and disciplines and the food and beverage were being served with great experience to the customer. As we do it in New York, we can do it in all our markets. So I think that's a great start for us. If we look at the lunch, we start in the same premise. A great ingredient building on the opportunity to serve existing customers who come into the stores. The lunch time, as Troy said, we're starting to see some growth in that earlier. I think the investments we're making in a combination, investments in tea will also both complement that lunch time occasion and give us time [indiscernible]. The food again will be starting from a fantastic ingredient relevant for our customers and will give them a fresh and healthy approach to food, really complement beverages we've done. The investments we made in supply chain supplies and the investments we made in our store so far will all help us with this food range. We've invested in [indiscernible] segment, a small test in San Francisco and it's around [indiscernible] it's around science, it's around convenience food for customers that are enjoying the store or take back to their office and it's been again extremely well received and we're extremely excited that we'll be able to follow on from the morning enhancement of our food with a lunch time offering which we think will be the start of a significant business around lunch.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much.", "Cliff Burrows", "Thanks, Michael.", "Operator", "The next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. I guess still two things on La Boulange. One is when will you feel comfortable in talking about the sales lift, it's the question I guess that's imposed a number of times and what point or how many stores do you need to feel comfortable that you've got a good baseline? And then secondly why wouldn't this be additive? I know you noted a couple of times mid single digit comps and I understand you want to be reasonable in terms of the expectation, but it doesn't seem like any \u2013 is there anything that's going to fall away from this that you lose, is there some anniversarying of some of the lunch items you've added recently that you have less confidence in or do you simply just see the business maybe be more moderate in the last few weeks or months and maybe that gives you rise for caution?", "Troy Alstead", "John, let me speak to comp growth and then I'm going to ask Cliff to come back to a bit more on La Boulange. The first thing to remind you and everyone is and of course you know this, John, but comp growth trends towards zero every year for everybody out there, every retailer, anybody who measures it. Everything we did over the past year to drive the fantastic and amazing comp growth because of the new system that we've done, beverage generation, food, contribution from loyalty, all those things now are in the baseline and as we move into this coming year just doing those things again would provide zero additional conflict. What we need to do and what we have great confidence in by the way is our ability to come up with that next level of beverage generation, the next fantastic food program, the elevation of food that continue the enhancements to consumer technology and to the loyalty program. But all those things need to be more and better than last year [indiscernible]. So comp growth can never be active. It starts over and we believe we had the ability to take what we've done in the past year and yet add to it in terms of traffic, volumes, in terms of dollar sales to our system. And by doing that we believe a mid single digit comp growth on a system, the size of our Starbucks and the maturity of Starbucks is nothing short of outstanding.", "Howard Schultz", "Troy, let me add one more thing. It seems like we can't get through our conference call without somehow this tension between us and you with regarding to comp growth guidance. But let's just try and establish common language so there's an understanding about what it is we're trying to do and what it is we're trying to guide. Last quarter we had a 9% comp in the U.S. business and I had said then as I think we're trying to say now that was an 8% comp this quarter and it would be just irresponsible of any of us at Starbucks to project to you or guide you to that level. Now, do we have aspirations to try and do it again as we did this year? Absolutely. Do we think we can? Many of us think we can but we're not going to sit here and put a number out there that is such a stretch target and have you put it in your model. And then we come up with a 6 or 7 which gets our peer group as stunning and incredible and then you write reports that says we've disappointed. That's not going to happen. So the guidance we're giving is the most responsible guidance we could possible provide you especially when you consider the maturation of our store base and the number of stores. Now one other thing. What La Boulange is providing us well beyond the morning pastries and the lunch is a significant platform to go after need states and dayparts well into the future. And what we've learned over the years is that our stores now provide a third place well beyond the morning daypart which was our core business just five, six years ago. The opportunity to expand Starbucks significantly in the future with the innovations that we've talked about in our prepared remarks and the food is well beyond what we are today. But I think we've always tried not to provide aspirations and guidance that was so far out field from reality and provide you with an opportunity with real numbers and I think not to allow any of us to get so far ahead of us of this specially when we have a situation in the U.S. whether it's quite a bit of uncertainty in terms of customer confidence, consumer confidence and consumer behavior that relates to the government shutdown and what can happen in February, well once again we\u2019re looking at a possible to fall. So this is the most responsible thing we can do on the heels of a record year in our 42-year history a record quarter and a comp number that no one, no other company in our peer group, well no other company that any of you analyze has put up against us. So this is a remarkable opportunity for us to have a yearend result and once again try and provide a comp number that we think is responsible, and I think the most judicious thing we can possible do.", "Troy Alstead", "So John, just to say when we will be able to share the contribution La Boulange is giving us and quite frankly it will be after we\u2019ve rolled out all markets and we\u2019ve really what happens in the first year. We are going very quickly with the rollout. I am absolutely delighted about the fact we got to 3,500 stores by the end of the financial year. We\u2019ll complete the rest of the stores and we\u2019ve already said the stores company operated will be completed in FY \u201914. We will also have the opportunity to bring a new food range to our Canadian business into our licensed stores, so we\u2019re busy working on that. It is a new skill for us. It is a new discipline, we\u2019ve been beverage led for a very long time and we will continue to work on the operational data. The fantastic thing is we can respond very quickly on recipes, on customer feedback and that is also part of this. So we\u2019re in that learning phase, but I really am excited by way our partners and our customers are receiving the food. We have some great success stores. Really again, I just want to go through with the operational discipline we\u2019ve brought to be Americas and make sure that when we share something with you, we can continue to build up that, but it's definitely complementing the experience for the customer, complementing the beverage purchase and our potential for the future is exceptionally strong with food. Thanks, John.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thanks, Troy.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. I want to ask two questions if I can, I want to take advantage of Howard and John being on the call and I\u2019ll just ask about the recent media coverage about pricing in China and just your perspective on it. And then secondly I want to go back to an earlier question; that\u2019s much the staffing that\u2019s needed for La Boulange, but kind of a broader question, not just La Boulange base, while you had a point in terms of speed of service where something else has to change to handle this tremendous level of traffic growth that you\u2019re driving?", "Howard Schultz", "I\u2019ll take the later question. Unlike others who have talked about speed of service or throughput issues that is not a problem that we have or anticipate. So, you can take that off the table. And in fact what we have been able to do with mobile payment in the card have absolutely cracked the code in terms of to me it's the speed of service and we\u2019re only going to get better at that because we will be introducing new levels of technology in calendar \u201914. We have no speed of service or throughput issue inside Starbucks to take that off the table. John?", "John Culver", "Thanks Joe, for the question. Regarding the recent media speculation on the price issue on China, as you know Joe we\u2019ve been in China now for 15 years and we have over a 1000 stores. We operate in over 60 cities across the mainland. And as this issue became public, we acted very swiftly and as we always have communicated in an very open, honest, transparent and very factual way with our customer\u2019s, and one thing I would say is that we have been able to build a level of trust, loyalty, respect with our customers and key stakeholders across the country and we felt it was important that we should respond very openly and transparently to them. In terms of the speculation, there\u2019s a couple of things I\u2019d like to point out. First is, that the prices that we charge for our products in China, the Latte are comparable to and in some cases lower than the competition; so that\u2019s number one. Number two, the prices that we are charging in the market actually reflects the cost of doing business in that market, and at the same time reflect a level of investments that we\u2019re making ahead of the curve so that we can feel the future growth of the business. So, we will continue to be very transparent, very open and very factual with any questions that come up around pricing. But let me just add that, as a company building a large business in China well over a 1000 stores and beyond, that we\u2019re not immune to the challenges and complexities of building a large business in China, but at the same time given the trust and loyalty that we\u2019ve been able to build with our customer base there as well as key stakeholders across the mainland that we have tremendous confidence in our ability to continue to build a very strong business, not only in 2014 but well into the future.", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "John Culver", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jason West with Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Well, thanks. Just one on the channel development side; the revenue growth accelerated there. It sounds like that was mainly driven by the better pricing positioning I guess, but just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what drove that revenue growth and is that the kind of number you guys are expecting kind of going forward?", "John Culver", "Well, I think that we obviously had very strong growth in the quarter and finished the year very strong double-digit revenue growth for the year. The results that you saw on the fourth quarter were the results of the momentum that the business is beginning to get around the LTR on package coffee. But then also the momentum that we\u2019re building on K-Cups. And as I said, K-Cup growth during the quarter was 42%. We\u2019ve added two additional skews in the quarter and we got aggressive plans to continue to expand and grow the K-Cup offering in 2014 throughout the year. I think it's also important to note that I talked a little bit about the My Starbucks Rewards down the aisle. And as we\u2019ve talked in the past, this is our opportunity to leverage the strategic flywheel that Howard spoke about. And in a very short period of time just over three months, we\u2019ve been able to provide over 1.5 million stars to our most loyal customers down the aisle who are purchasing our package coffee. So, we remain very optimistic that we can continue to accelerate stars down the aisle and leverage that flywheel. Going forward, as I said there is volatility that\u2019s happening down the aisle and in the grocery segment particularly as it relates to package roast and ground coffee. We feel we\u2019re very well positioned to navigate that volatility. We\u2019ve got a lot of new innovation that\u2019s coming into the business this year not only on the package coffee side but also K-Cups, VIA and other items. And what you\u2019re going to see this year in 2014 is that our performance is going to build by quarter and with the back half being stronger pieces of business due to the first half LTR rollover. So again my comments earlier we\u2019re committed to sustain double-digit growth in this business both on the top and bottom line in 2014, and we\u2019re looking forward to another very successful year in the channels.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks for the color.", "John Culver", "Yeah.", "Operator", "The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Great, hi, thank you. First quickly and then a longer question. Troy, do you have the Starbucks card balance at the end of the quarter in front of you?", "Troy Alstead", "Yes, we do. I\u2019m going to have Adam Brotman actually make a couple of comments about that. Adam is our Chief Digital Officer. He is here with us. Go ahead, Adam.", "Adam Brotman", "Hi, John. At the end of the quarter the balance in the U.S. was $621 million and reflected by the record year we just had $4 billion loaded across U.S. and Canada.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "And do you have that corporate balance as well that we see on the balance sheet?", "Adam Brotman", "I don\u2019t have that with me at the time.", "John Culver", "Yes, let me (indiscernible) the question John, I\u2019ll try to answer (indiscernible).", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Okay, all right. Great, thank you. And Howard maybe this question is for you, a couple of years ago, I guess in 2009 at least part of the Starbucks revitalization you included a refocus of excelling at your store level base which obviously you did in a fairly profound way. When we listen to the call today, I mean there's a number of initiatives that are coming into the stores the next couple of years, Teavana, cold carbonated drinks, the continued expansion and focus on La Boulange specifically and maybe food more generally that does add more complication to the stores perhaps than the risk today. So it's kind of like a little bit of broader question just talk about how the system has been prepared and maybe relative to five years ago to handle this increased complexity with the lowest nature that you demonstrated over the past couple of years?", "Howard Schultz", "John, I think that's a very important and appropriate question and if you were in many of our meetings during this year as we prepare for fiscal '14, that was much of the conversation. We want to do one thing and one thing well and that is whatever we bring into the store we want it to be enhancing to the customer experience and complementary to our leadership position in coffee. Having said that I think the last two years of our stores that we've opened couple with the comp number demonstrates the significant health and strength and I say unequivocally the U.S. business has never been stronger or healthier than it is today in terms of financial results and the equity of brand and the experience. We feel very good that we have prepared our stores and if you go through them, Evolution juice when we brought into the store as we replaced an existing used product and enhanced the quality and hence the experience. Teavana tea that we're going to bring in at some point in calendar '14, we're already in the tea business. The tea represents less than 1% of our sales and we believe we can significantly expand that and in doing so create significant awareness and trial and use our [indiscernible] to drive new traffic and incrementality to Teavana stores. When we get to La Boulange we been selling food for 30 years, it just haven't been as good as our coffee. Now our food is as good as our coffee as we have a story to tell and we're going to tell that story in multiple dayparts and fulfill multiple needs states. Carbonation, that is a new category for us. The test results in Austin and Atlanta and in Japan and Singapore are very encouraging. We think there's a significant opportunity and again, we learned a lot over the last few years with our refreshment category that we have other than coffee and the opportunity in coffee, we have an opportunity to provide a need state in the afternoon and evening around refreshment. And also we've learned in the carbonation test itself that there's a significant food attachment to the carbonation beverages. So this works hand in hand with our opportunity and I think we're going to create more incrementality. I think Cliff and his team have done a wonderful job in not taking the entire country at once with any of these initiatives but sequentially going from market to market and learning from it and not leaving one market to go to the other until we have it right and that's why La Boulange has worked so successfully. That's exactly what we're going to do with all these initiatives as we did with Evolution juice. So the short answer is it's an appropriate question. We learned valuable lessons in 2006 and 2007. Those lessons have been learned and they will never ever be repeated. And we're in a position right now we're playing to our strength and we're going to continue to do that and leverage the fact that our stores are a meeting place and a gathering place for multiple dayparts well beyond the core coffee business that we began 42 years ago but we're always going to be the primary destination to the world's best coffee.", "Troy Alstead", "John, to your question about Starbucks card, at the end of the fourth quarter, so at the end of the fiscal year, the deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet and that deferred revenue balance especially the Starbucks card balances was $654 million. And by the way that's almost 30% growth over the same period a year ago, over the yearend 2012. And that 30% almost same growth in that balance on the balance sheet just reflects the continued tremendous uptake of Starbucks card of the adoption of loyalty of how mobile was contributing and how we're resonating with our customers in a way that is unique anywhere else in this space and by prepaying essentially a significant amount of transactions and having that sit in our balance sheet long before it turns into revenue.", "Cliff Burrows", "Let's start with [indiscernible] for the future of the company in the near term by having 30% greater loaded on the card versus a year ago and that 30% is almost three times greater than the growth rate of the company.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.", "Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer Company", "Great. Thank you very much. Just two questions. The first one is on EPS guidance for Troy. Particularly relating to the second quarter guidance, it looks like the first quarter guidance you're implying basically about 20% EPS growth and then fits down on a year-over-year basis to that 13 percentage range for the second quarter. So that's kind of below where you're going to be at for the full year. So what exactly is going on in that quarter, anything you can point out for us?", "Troy Alstead", "Yes, Brian, I'm happy to do that. First I'd make sure when you look at the second quarter growth rate over prior year, that got an unusual non-routine gain from a gain on the sale of our [indiscernible] business from Q2 over a year ago. So it's important you do that adjustment.", "Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer Company", "But it's still 13% off that 48.", "Troy Alstead", "Actually Brian, it's the range that we use 13% to 15%, so we will search for that mid teens EPS growth rate and then give me a moment, I'll explain what's going on. Our investment spending that we do throughout the year will vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and initiate to the second quarter. We are planning to spend a bit more in marketing just timing the spent throughout the year as we look at that quarter. We have a number of other routine investments that come and go from quarter to quarter the timing of which every year can move a little bit from here to there. So we put that guidance out there to-date but you have some more visibility and transparency into how we're planning the year and how we see the earnings progression. With that said there will be some quarters that are more like mid teens and there will be some quarters as we have delivered over this past year that will tip for the higher part of that range and that's why we have an earnings range out there that I would have you think about as we go forward.", "Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer Company", "Okay. And just something about cash flow on balance sheet, I mean you guys did almost $2 billion of free cash flow this fiscal year. I think you generated more free cash flow this year than you generated in operating cash flow last year. I know you took on some debt this quarter but it looks like you have over $3 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet I think. Obviously that looks to be more than enough liquidity to deal with any resolution with Kraft. Is there any update on that arbitration that you guys can give us any timing update or anything like that?", "Howard Schultz", "Brian, what we can say is that we expect resolution of that to hear from our trader before the end of the calendar year. Naturally our only news for today is that we expect that to be sometime before the end of this calendar year.", "Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer Company", "Okay. Thank you.", "Howard Schultz", "And you're right on your earlier points. Our cash flow was phenomenally strong in the year and I think that's very, very reflective of our strong performance in the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year and that consistently of strength of cash flow and the phenomenal strength of our balance sheet and the amount of cash we have sitting in the balance sheet both give me tremendous comfort that we have adequate liquidity to cover whatever the answer may be coming out of that arbitration and also gives us tremendous possibility as we look for the future and we make investments into our business and renovations and store development and gives us stability of elevating cash return to shareholders.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Mike, we're available for one last question and we'll follow-up with those that are left in queue.", "Operator", "The last question comes from Nicole Miller Regan with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.", "Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray", "Thank you. Thanks for the time. Of the royalty the 1.5 million I believe was incremental stars earned through the channel development. Can you talk to us about if anybody signed up new, so new users of the royalty program and then also what was most surprising versus what you tested and expected as you started to launch? Thank you very much.", "Adam Brotman", "Sure. Nicole, I'll take this. This is Adam. So first of all I would say that we \u2013 yes, we see a lot of new users coming to [indiscernible]. We're not ready to quantify those publicly but it's been exceeding our expectations in terms of both new users, it's been exceeding our expectations in terms of the velocity of take up of our loyalty members as well as new loyalty members that are being participating and frankly we were just getting started in terms of how we will integrate loyalty with our CBG business. So it's a great example of the strategic [indiscernible]. There's a mini version of it, there's a digital strategic [indiscernible]. We're integrating our loyalty card, mobile and now across channels and across brands and even across geographies. So this is just one example of how it's working well for us.", "Howard Schultz", "I would just add one thing that is in the sense what we're establishing is the Starbucks currency and that currency can be interchanged between Starbucks and Teavana stores and the stars the currency of the stars can now be leveraged across consumer products that are unparallel because its no other consumer product that has a retail store that can provide our customers with a reward and an incentive to come back and forth and this is just the beginning of us being able to thread these multiple channels of distributions and brands so that the customer has significant value in supporting and shopping at Starbucks Teavana and Starbucks consumer products.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you, Howard. That concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining us and we will speak to you again on the next call for Q1 fiscal 2014 earnings. Thank you. Have a good day.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s Starbucks Coffee Company\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013 earnings conference call.

Starbucks Q3 represents another quarter of outstanding operating and financial performance around the world, demonstrating once again the power and relevancy of the Starbucks brand and the success and scalability of our business model and go-to-market strategies.", "Today, over 300,000 Starbucks partners are serving over 70 million customers from almost 21,000 stores in 65 countries every week. I\u2019m particularly pleased to report that each of our reporting segments delivered solid performance in Q3 and contributed to our accelerated 11% increase in revenues to $4.2 billion.", "Particularly noteworthy is that our U.S. retail store business delivered comp growth of 7%, ahead of our own expectations and a stunning achievement on a base of over 6,800 stores against 9% comps in Q3 last year and in the face of continuing challenging U.S. economic and consumer environments.", "Over the last two years, our U.S. business has produced revenue growth of over 22%.

", "Innovation has also been a key driver of Starbucks business, and today, deep trust in the Starbucks brand, our emotional connection to consumers around the world, and our scale afford us the opportunity to innovate beyond our core coffee business.", "I previously shared our intent to reinvent the tea category, just as we did the coffee category, and we are making meaningful progress against our plan to do so. In Q3, we introduced both Teavana Oprah Chai and Teavana Shaken Iced Tea to tremendous customer response. Just last week, we opened our fourth new Teavana tea bar on Third Avenue and 63rd Street in Manhattan, and in the fall, we\u2019ll be opening another iconic Teavana tea bar on Broadway and Ninth Street in New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village.", "These innovations are emblematic of the future vision we have for Teavana, and have drawn attention to the tea category, elevated the Teavana brand, and these new, innovative beverages have driven incrementality in both Starbucks and Teavana stores.", "In addition, last month we introduced Fizzio, Starbucks\u2019 brand of preservative-free, hand crafted, cold carbonated beverages in approximately 3,000 of our stores in the U.S. Sun Belt. Consumer response to Fizzio has been strong and following the successful test in both Japan and Singapore, we plan to introduce Fizzio in select international markets in the quarters ahead.", "Teavana Oprah Chai, Teavana Shaken Iced Tea, and Fizzio are providing us with highly differentiated, hand crafted beverages that attract customers during afternoon and evening day parts and drive increased food attachment.

Expect to see an expanding and evolving portfolio of proprietary coffees under the Reserve brand from our coffee farm in Costa Rica and around the world in the future.", "At the same time, we are aggressively pursuing new store segmentation opportunities in order to showcase Clover, pour-over, and other unique brewing methods. ", "As Starbucks continues to deliver record revenues and profits, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear to others what we have known all along, that Starbucks\u2019 most valuable asset is our store partners, our people.", "The culture of our company has been curated in our stores and is on display every day as partners connect with customers and one another. Recognizing the respect that Chinese children have for their parents, two years ago I hosted the first family meeting of its kind in China, a coming together of partners, parents, and families, at which we shared Starbucks\u2019 values, heritage, and culture and an aspiration to improve the lives of youth and the communities in which they live. And last month, we held two more extraordinary family meetings of this type in Guangzhou and Beijing. ", "This year, we\u2019ve brought the concept to the U.S., holding family meetings in New York City; Washington, DC; and Seattle, and introducing the Starbucks College Achievement Plan, the unique benefit we are providing to our U.S. partners.", "Just as millions of partners and their families have benefited from healthcare and stock equity over the last few years, the Starbucks College Achievement Plan will benefit our people by helping them earn a college degree, unlocking doors to life-changing opportunities, dreams, and their own aspirations. Investments such as these promote increased trust and loyalty, strengthen our bond with our people, and help us support them both professionally and personally. ", "We also continue to seek opportunities to develop our next generation of leaders. I have no doubt that the global leadership conferences we\u2019ve held in New Orleans in 2008 and Houston in 2012 directly contributed to the record results we reported in 2013 and now are seeding in 2014. I\u2019m looking forward to hosting over 2,000 district managers in Seattle this October and our next global leadership conferences in Orlando, Florida, in October 2015. ", "We continue to elevate the equity of the Starbucks brand through the introduction of flagship, unique stores all over the world that deliver strong unit economics and cast a bright halo over all things Starbucks. In Q3 alone, we opened 344 stores, including a technology forward company owned store at Walt Disney World in Florida, our ninth Disney store as part of that partnership.", "I\u2019m highlighting the new Disney store because Disney stores are among the highest-volume stores in our portfolio and we are actively pursuing further opportunities to partner with Disney and open additional Disney stores around the world.", "But relevance and innovation are not limited to our U.S. store portfolio. We recently opened two stunning flagship stores in China that I saw for myself just a couple of months ago, including in Beijing, where we opened our first 24-hour store to a tremendous customer response, giving us confidence that we can introduce additional 24-hour store formats elsewhere in the world.", "And just last week, I had the opportunity to experience firsthand the romance and local influences unique to Colombia\u2019s rich coffee heritage and see it come to life in our first opening in Colombia. The design of this iconic three-story, spectacular flagship store in Bogota was inspired by Starbucks\u2019 unique 43-year relationship with Colombian coffee farmers dating back to our first store in the Pike Place Market in Seattle.", "Honestly, it was simply one of the most extraordinary emotional celebratory openings I have ever witnessed. And customers will find the same level of imaginative design in Vietnam, where over the last few days we\u2019ve opened our first two Starbucks stores in Hanoi, showcasing stunning local artwork and d\u00e9cor that speaks to Vietnam\u2019s strong coffee legacy.", "New stores in different countries on different continents, with different coffee cultures and no aided awareness to speak of, but the same results: lines out the door and customers clamoring to get in day after day, from morning until night. These openings remind me that despite the size of our current global store footprint, pent-up demand for the Starbucks experience continues to increase, and that we have untold markets yet to open and expand in the years ahead.", "Digital platforms have been instrumental in building brand loyalty and extending and deepening customer engagement with the Starbucks brand. We have invested well ahead of the curve to create opportunities for our customers to engage with their social and digital networks on mobile devices and are now beginning to see the payoff of these investments.", "While many national and international retailers are just beginning to appreciate the critical importance of integrating a mobile platform into their business, Starbucks continues to expand our leadership position by providing the digital services and content our customers truly value and appreciate. And we are committed to developing new digital products and services that are relevant to our customers, deepen our brand engagement, and leverage the network effect of a growing digital platform in the future.", "Starbucks digital success starts with the popularity of our cards, and the loyalty program associated with those cards. The Starbucks card is now available to customers in 29 global markets. Our My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program now has over 8 million active members in the U.S. and continues to grow around the world.", "In fact, in China today, MSR transactions now account for over 40% of total tender, a remarkable metric, and demonstrates the loyalty of our Chinese customers and the relationship they have to this card.", "Stars, the loyalty program rewards currency, are highly motivating to consumers. We are seeing rapidly growing participation in the program and increasingly positive results through offering stars as rewards in highly targeted one-to-one marketing. ", "And we are seeing this not only in our stores - and this is really important - but in the grocery channel as well. The extension of MSR to include the integration of star codes on packaged coffee in the grocery channel is proving highly accretive, with nearly 1.3 million MSR members having earned and redeemed nearly 7 million stars to date, as we leverage multiple channels\u2019 distribution.", "The core strength of our loyalty program is fueling adoption of our mobile app. Customers continue to embrace our industry-leading mobile app in increasing numbers, and we now have almost 12 million active users of our mobile app in the U.S. and Canada alone. Mobile payment now accounts for over 15% of all transactions in our U.S. company operated stores and we are now processing on average 6 million mobile transactions in the U.S. every week alone.", "By integrating mobile loyalty, payment, and in-store digital experiences, we are creating game-changing technologies and experiences for our customers, and the opportunity to introduce new lines of business for our company. A prime example of this is our forthcoming mobile order and pay initiative that will allow customers to use their phones and MSR accounts to order ahead of arriving at a store where we plan to pilot in a major U.S. market later this year.", "Mobile order and pay will be the fastest and easiest way for customers to order, pay for, and pick up their purchases, once again demonstrating the lead position Starbucks has in all things mobile. Mobile ordering is just the first of many initiatives in the pipeline that will enable Starbucks to extend its lead position in mobile payments, while leveraging the value of Starbucks stars to tens of millions of loyal customers across the globe.", "As Starbucks enters its Q4, we are well on our way to meeting our growth targets for fiscal 2014, and ideally positioned to continue delivering double digit top and bottom line growth into the future. I could not be more proud of our Starbucks partners or of the exceptional execution and extraordinary results we are delivering to our shareholders, but we strongly believe the best is yet to come.

", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon everyone. Our third quarter results are a testament to the growing strength and global relevancy of the Starbucks brand. Q3 performance was driven by continued beverage and food innovation, deepening our connection to customers and elevating our customer experience through phenomenal execution by our partners.", "I\u2019ll discuss our third quarter performance for each reporting segment and then turn the discussion over to Scott for additional details on our financial results, our outlook for the balance of fiscal \u201914 and preliminary targets for fiscal 2015.", "Each of our reportable segments set new third quarter records for revenue and operating income. Let me start with the Americas segment, which delivered another quarter of strong results, despite a persistently difficult retail environment.", "Total net revenues in the Americas were $3.1 billion in Q3, up 10% over the prior year. The largest driver of this increase was strong comp growth of 6%, with 4% coming from ticket growth and 2% from transactions. These results are particularly significant given the 9% comp we were lapping from a year ago.", "Comp growth for our U.S. business outpaced that of the Americas, accelerating to 7%. One of the primary drivers of this growth is the strong progress we\u2019re making with food. The improved quality and variety of our food offerings once again drove 2 points of comp growth, and we expect that the ongoing innovations we\u2019re planning will continue to drive comps in the coming years.", "In addition to providing a meaningful contribution to our comp growth, our food program is also driving significant margin improvement. Working closely with our vendors, we\u2019re benefitting from improved manufacturing costs. In our stores, our efforts to improve inventory management and waste are paying off.", "A major contributor to our success in food is our breakfast sandwich platform, which delivered 40% growth in the third quarter. The bakery rollout of La Boulange in our U.S. stores is nearly complete, with remaining stores slating to be converted by mid to late August. ", "Throughout the rollout, we continue to make enhancements to the line and leverage operational learnings through all day parts as we go, including our lunch program. We\u2019ve learned a great deal from the breakthrough launch and from our current lunch test, closely monitoring customer and partner response as we test new offerings.", "These learnings have influenced our approach to enhancing our lunch program. Customer response to the two new sandwiches we introduced at the end of the third quarter has been very positive, leading to an uptick in sales and attach rates to our lunch offerings.", "This recent success has encouraged us to introduce new SKUs to the lunch line going forward, and we\u2019ll continue to evolve our lunch program with this disciplined, measured approach, which minimizes disruption to both store operations and customer routines.", "It also allows us to test and adjust products as necessary. By the end of fiscal 2015, we expect the lunch program to look very different than it does today, and we will continue to evolve and enhance our lunch offerings in the years ahead. ", "In addition to food, beverage innovation was a strong contributor to our results, with a new limited time offering, Caf\u00e9 Espresso Frappuccino to our growing refreshments platform including Teavana Iced and Shaken Teas and Refreshers, to Teavana Oprah Chai, which also ", "helped drive overall growth in our chai tea platform. ", "Our core Frappuccino beverages also performed well, demonstrating the healthy balance of new and longtime favorites driving customers\u2019 purchases. And in addition, pricing contributed 1 point to comp growth in the quarter.", "Howard already mentioned Fizzio. We are equally excited about innovation in the refreshment category with our super premium Teavana branded teas in our entire U.S. Canadian company operated store portfolio. ", "Our summer Teavana Shaken Iced Tea limited time offerings have been in stores since May, and have significantly up-leveled our tea offerings. Returning favorite Peach Green Tea Lemonade and a new Blackberry Mojito Tea Lemonade are delivering strong results, and we expect both to remain customer favorites throughout the summer.", "These innovative beverage offerings, along with our new lunch sandwiches, are part of our bigger initiative to consistently grow across all day parts, including afternoons, which have shown the strongest comp growth over the last few quarters. ", "Drive-thrus remain a very important part of our U.S. store portfolio, as they continue to deliver very strong results. They account for more than 40% of our company operated stores and continue to show double digit total sales growth year over year for the third consecutive year.", "This speaks to the convenience they provide for our customers throughout their daily travels. Our field teams remain focused on consistently enhancing our drive-thru customer experience, including investments in innovative design elements and functionality. As we broaden and expand our drive-thru program, we see another layer of opportunity for tremendous growth.", "Now turning to EMEA, where the turnaround continues to progress. The region delivered strong 13% revenue growth in the third quarter, attributable to favorable foreign currency exchange, 3% comp growth, and incremental revenue from 161 net new stores opened in the last 12 months.", "The 3% comp growth was the fifth consecutive quarter with positive comps, driven by a 2% lift in transactions and a 2% rise in average ticket. The two-year comp at 5% represents the highest two-year comp since the first quarter of 2012. Continued focus on solid in-store execution and a strong lineup of products, including continued progress in up-leveling our food program in Europe are all contributing to these strong results. ", "Also noteworthy to highlight, comps from two of our largest EMEA markets, the U.K. and Germany, where economic recovery is taking hold, outpaced the overall regional comp growth for the quarter. The outlook for the U.K. in particular continues to be positive, supported by declining unemployment and the expectation of a sixth consecutive quarter of positive GDP growth.", "Our EMEA license markets are also performing exceptionally well. Turkey and the Middle East in particular continue to outperform, with even stronger comp growth relative to company operated stores. These results support our license-focused growth strategy for the region, where today 50% of our stores are licensed.", "Turning to the China Asia Pacific region, where our growth aspirations continue to be reaffirmed by the robust performance of our new stores and the strong comp growth we continue to deliver in this region. CAP total net revenues grew 23% to $288 million in Q3, a new all-time record, and represents the 15th consecutive quarter with revenue growth in excess of 20%.", "The largest driver of this growth was incremental revenue from new stores. A key driver of the strong comp growth is our ability to innovate and offer our customers beverage and food options that appeal to their unique tastes. We introduced several record breaking limited time offerings in the blended category that were received with great enthusiasm by customers.", "In China and select Asian markets, the strawberry cheesecake Frappuccino set instant records for the top-selling limited time Frappuccino offering ever. Beverages and products that revolve around our coffee core also showed momentum, including VIA lattes and Reserve coffees in some of our key markets, and our Macchiato marketing campaign highlighted barista artistry and brought Starbucks espresso expertise to the forefront as a key differentiator. ", "CAP\u2019s 7% comp growth for Q3 reflects a 6% increase in traffic, which is outstanding considering we were lapping an exceptionally high 8% traffic comp a year ago. There are a few metrics worth highlighting relative to our CAP performance in the third quarter. ", "Two year comps for the region are at a strong 16%. Once again, comps in China outpaced the region overall, despite concerns around an economic slowdown in China. And, the political instability in China has eased slightly, but continued to weigh at consumers in Q3. Traffic from this market has still not returned to the strong levels achieved in prior periods. ", "These results, and the investments we\u2019ve made across the region give me great confidence about our future performance in the CAP segment. Into the third quarter, we\u2019ve had 4,425 stores in this region, which included 543 net new stores opened during the past 9 months, keeping us on track to meet our target of 750 new stores in CAP for fiscal 2014.", "Finally, new channel development, where our third quarter performance has reaffirmed our confidence about expanding customer occasions outside Starbucks retail stores. This segment achieved new records for revenues and operating income in the third quarter, which resulted in double digit revenue growth and strong margin expansion.", "Revenues were $375 million, a 13% increase over the prior third quarter, primarily driven by increased sales of premium single serve products and increased sales volumes of packaged coffees.", "We gained share during the quarter both in the premium single cup category and the premium packaged coffee space, underscoring our leadership position in premium at-home coffee. Looking ahead, we are very excited about the innovation we will be introducing across our coffee portfolio in Q4, with several new K-cup SKUs including flavored coffees, the addition of Fall Blend and single origin coffees in both K-cup and packaged coffee, as well as new VIA lattes.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott to take you through financial results for the quarter, our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2014, and preliminary targets for fiscal 2015. Scott? ", "Scott Maw ", "Thanks, Troy, and good afternoon everyone. Our business has performed exceptionally well once again this year, and the third quarter continued that trend, thanks to fantastic execution and customer focus by our partners across the globe.", "I\u2019m particularly pleased with our consolidated comp store sales, which increased 6% and revenue growth of over 11%. Our consolidated operating income grew 25% to $769 million, a new third quarter record. This translates into 18.5% operating margin, an increase of 200 basis points over the prior year.", "In terms of segment profitability, operating income in the Americas grew to $728 million, up 18% over the last third quarter. Operating margin expanded 150 basis points to 24%, primarily driven by strong sales leverage. ", "These are clearly fantastic results, and our 7% U.S. comp growth in particular takes on even greater significance given recent same-store sales trend data reported by many other retailers. ", "EMEA\u2019s profitability continues to improve as we remain focused on the turnaround in that market. Operating income more than tripled to $29 million over the prior third quarter and operating margin expanded 580 basis points to 9%.", "Sales leverage, combined with our intense cost focus throughout the P&L, were key drivers to the margin expansion. We are also very pleased with the performance in China Asia Pacific, which delivered strong operating income exceeding $100 million for the very first time.", "This 19% increase over last year, which translated into a 35% operating margin, reflects particularly strong performance from China company owned stores and our JV partnerships in South Korea, Japan, and East China.", "The ongoing portfolio shift towards more company operated stores and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange from a weaker yen were partially offset by strong sales leverage, leading to a 120 basis point operating margin reduction.", "Margin expansion for channel development continued in Q3. Revenue increased 13% and operating profit grew 45% to $139 million. Operating margin of 37% was an 800 basis point improvement over last year. The largest driver was favorable coffee costs, but underlying efficiencies such as improved inventory management practices also contributed.", "The operating loss related to all other segments expanded in the third quarter to $19 million, reflecting continued investments in our emerging businesses. On a consolidated basis, our excellent global revenue growth and margin expansion drove up earnings per share 22% to $0.67, a new record.", "Additionally, we returned nearly $500 million to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. On a year to date basis, cash returns to shareholders totaled $1. 82 billion based on our history for this period.", "Finally, Q3 operating cash flow was $850 million, up 28% from last year, driven by strong business unit performance and ongoing working capital efficiencies.", "And now I want to cover how we expect to finish fiscal 2014. To better understand and evaluate our future performance, I will be referencing certain non-GAAP financial measures.", "Our excellent results across the company in the third quarter put us in a great position to deliver another year of strong growth. We\u2019re now targeting fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.73 to $0.75, which excludes an estimated net benefit of $0.03 related to the sale of our retail operations in Australia and Malaysia that may close in the fourth quarter.", "This gives us growth of 22% to 25% over Q4 2013 calculated on a non-GAAP basis. It\u2019s very important to note that our Q3 EPS growth rate was 22%, and we believe this same rate of significant growth or perhaps a slight increase will continue in Q4.", "On a GAAP basis, whole year fiscal 2014 EPS will be in the range of $2.70 to $2.72. Non-GAAP EPS will be in the range of $2.65 to $2.67, which excludes the estimated net benefit of $0.03 related to the sale of the previously mentioned retail operations and the $0.02 benefit from a litigation credit recorded in our first quarter of this year.", "This gives us a very strong 21% to 22% growth over fiscal 2013, calculated based on non-GAAP EPS. In terms of our other targets, we continue to expect revenue growth of 10% or better, driven by strong global comp store sales growth in the mid-single digits. We now expect to open 1,550 net new stores globally, with the 50 additional stores from our prior target coming from the Americas.", "Consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2014 is now expected to be an approximately 200 basis point improvement over FY2013 when excluding the Kraft litigation charge in fiscal 2013, an excellent result, driven by strong sales leverage and commodity favorability.", "We continue to expect moderate operating margin improvement year over year in the Americas. In EMEA, we remain on target for our operating margin reaching the high single-digits as evidenced by our strong performance so far this year.", "In CAP, we continue to target operating margin moving towards the low 30% range, including year over year margin deceleration in Q4 given the ongoing ownership mix shift and lapping certain favorable nonrecurring items from last year.", "And for channel development, given the strong year to date performance, we are increasing our operating margin expectation to approximately 600 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal 2014.", "Looking ahead to 2015, we anticipate again delivering significant growth for our shareholders while investing in critical capabilities for our customers and partners. We are recommitting to our long term guidance for EPS growth of 15% to 20%.", "Next year, we anticipate EPS growth within that same range on a non-GAAP basis. However, toward the lower end due to the following factors. First, the past two years have included significant commodity cost tailwinds. This includes 4 percentage points, or approximately $0.10 of this year\u2019s EPS growth attributable to favorable commodity costs.", "In contrast, next year we expect commodity costs to be roughly neutral, or have a minor unfavorable impact based on the roughly 60% of our coffee needs we now have price protected for fiscal 2015. Second, we continue evaluating opportunities to drive long term growth in our businesses, with a specific focus on enhancing the partner experience and digital related investments.", "Other targets for fiscal 2015 include revenue growth of 10% or greater, global comparable store sales growth in the mid-single digits and 1,600 net new stores globally, with 650 in the Americas, 150 in EMEA, and 800 net new stores in China Asia Pacific.", "These represent our initial growth targets for 2015. We\u2019re still in the process of finalizing our annual operating plan, which is due to be wrapped up in September. We will then provide further details on our fiscal 2015 targets when we report Q4 and fiscal 2014 earnings in late October.", "The results we delivered in Q3 are the product of a business model built on continuous innovation, on an intense customer focus, and on world-class execution. Over the years, we have consistently invested to support and growth that model, all while delivering significant shareholder value. ", "And while we have again set challenging targets for Q4 and beyond, we are confident in our trajectory for a number of reasons, including innovation as a core competency of ours. And as a result, we have multiple layers of significant diverse growth opportunities in the pipeline. ", "Our position as the global coffee authority is a major asset, and we continue to invest and focus on extending our capabilities in this area. Our industry leading store design and digital capabilities deliver outstanding results, with much more coming in the years ahead. And our focus on our people will only accelerate, with a clear correlation between enhancing the partner experience and delivering excellent results.", "Finally, as we expand, invest, and innovate, we will maintain a sharp level of financial discipline, preserve a strong balance sheet, and generate increasing cash flow. This will result in powerful returns on capital and will continue to significantly benefit our shareholders.", "With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] Your final question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Buckingham Research.", "Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research ", "On the same-store sales front in the U.S., commentary on sort of the contributors to that as far as what you\u2019re seeing from food and other items that might be driving that, and even very early results, but results that you see in the markets where you have Fizzio, if that encourages you to maybe even expand that out further.", "Clifford Burrows", "We\u2019re very pleased with the strength of the 7% comp in the U.S. business. It is a mixture of both ticket and transaction. We have seen continued strength from our food business, as we roll out that launch. It has been a contributor of 2% to the comp in the quarter. It has been underpinned and supported by beverage innovation, whether it is the iced teas from Teavana or whether it is Fizzio in its early days, in the Sun Belt region.", "And also, the Frappuccino limited time offers this season have also performed strongly, so really, really pleased in company operated and licensed, and with our new store performance. So all around, very strong performance in the U.S.", "Howard Schultz", "I would just add, it\u2019s clear to us that we have a significant opportunity in the need state of refreshment. And shaken Teavana iced tea and Fizzio has reaffirmed that, and we see that as just the beginning of both afternoon and evening opportunities. And we are bullish on all things tea, and we are excited about what\u2019s happening with the introduction of Fizzio. Just the beginning.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Keith Siegner with UBS.", "Keith Siegner - UBS", "Just a quick question on channel development. Very strong numbers. Particularly on the margin, and what\u2019s most impressive is those margins are before you even include the pricing [unintelligible]. So I was just wondering, maybe Scott, if you could talk a little bit about, as we think through the channel development margins during the next few quarters, what other factors do we need to consider in modeling out that margin beyond the late July price increase? Are there investments you\u2019re making? Mix changes? International? What other factors should we consider?", "John Culver", "I\u2019ll take that question. In terms of the margin expansion, we\u2019re very pleased with the 800 basis point improvement on the quarter. We\u2019re seeing strong execution across all categories. If you look at our share growth across packaged coffee, across K-cups, as well as RTD and Tazo tea, huge share gains in each of those categories, so very pleased with that.", "What\u2019s driving that is the innovation that we\u2019re pushing into each of these areas, in packaged coffees with limited time offerings, single origins, new K-cup SKUs coming into the mix with the Blond product as well as the flavors. We\u2019ve got innovation coming in in tea. ", "And then couple that with the fact that we saw strong execution down the aisle from a display standpoint. We feel as though we\u2019re hitting on all cylinders in terms of what the team\u2019s delivering. We also had some upside as it relates to coffee costs in the quarter, which helped contribute to the margin expansion. And we\u2019re really focused and disciplined on managing the operations in a way that is going to continue to drive growth on the bottom line.", "We\u2019re very much encouraged in terms of these stars down the aisle, and the fact that we had 1.5 million members redeem nearly 7 million stars since we introduced that program. And that program continues to gain traction. And then we also have the Starbucks siren, the Starbucks siren down the aisle that we have about 400 locations that we\u2019re targeting to have built out by the end of this year, which is also helping us as well.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays ", "Just looking at the Americas specifically, in terms of the comp, it looks like the last few quarters the ticket continues to rise. So it was 1%, then 3%. Now it\u2019s 4%. Related to that, a couple of question. Just one, I\u2019m wondering whether that\u2019s a conscious push of maybe premium products if there\u2019s anything in particular, whether that\u2019s being driven by food. And then as it ties into food, I\u2019m just wondering, it seems like lunch, the rollout was targeted for fiscal \u201915. I\u2019m wondering what you expect the contribution to be. I\u2019m assuming that it will be meaningfully incremental relative to the breakfast and maybe boost up that 2 percentage point contribution. Any thoughts on that would be great. ", "Clifford Burrows ", "There\u2019s no doubt that the work we\u2019ve done with food over the last two years, with the investment in La Boulange and then the rollout of these fantastic new morning pastries, and the products around all day parts supported by whether it\u2019s pastries [unintelligible], loaf cakes, all of that is really helping us to increase our attach. And it is giving us an opportunity to improve quality. And we\u2019ve had a benefit from ticket in their area.", "We also went in and we are now in, I guess, our 10th year of breakfast sandwiches. And we did a major overhaul and upgrade of the ingredients. And we really did see a 40% growth versus the previous year. So there is absolute confidence that we\u2019re heading in the right direction with food. ", "As Troy said earlier, we introduced two new lunch products, two new sandwiches, and we\u2019ve seen those perform well. And we are testing in a couple of markets a lot of innovations around lunch. And we will keep testing. And as we prove out new products, new ideas, we will roll them out. And really, that will happen from now throughout 2015. ", "As Howard said, the beverages we\u2019ve got around refreshment, whether it\u2019s the iced shaken teas from Teavana, or whether it is Fizzio, they again support this lunchtime occasion. We\u2019re equally excited about the opportunity with evenings, and that is not just around the wine and beer element, but it will be around food, the opportunity to sell tea and coffee beverages, and we\u2019re in the early days there.", "So there is an opportunity for us not only to continue to grow transactions, but also to grow ticket in different day parts. ", "Howard Schultz ", "I would add one thing, and I think this is an important opportunity to make this statement. Food at Starbucks, I think we could all admit, for many, many years was a weakness and a challenge for us, and I would say, unequivocally, with the acquisition of La Boulange and the execution of Cliff and his team, has now become a significant strength and a driver of multiple occasions, need states, and the opportunity for Starbucks to leverage day parts that we did not have access to before. And we\u2019re just getting started. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ", "Maybe some follow up on the recent food comment. Can you talk about food attachment rates? I guess I\u2019d be most interested in the morning day part, but maybe in total, and how those are trending, where you think they might go?", "And then I wanted to ask one more, too, on the expansion. The Americas number being bumped up by 50 units this year, is that in the United States? Or someplace else within the Americas? That you\u2019re raising that target?", "Troy Alstead", "First, on food, we don\u2019t specifically disclose specific attach rates, so I won\u2019t give you a specific number to hang on. I will tell you, though, unequivocally, we are selling more food in the morning day part. Food is becoming an increasing driver - the fastest transaction growth we have in our entire store system is happening at midday and into the afternoon. And food, along with the refreshment category that Howard has spoken about, is the primary driver of that additional day part expansion.", "So across all throughout the day, food is giving us an uplift in ticket, is contributing to, we believe, traffic growth into the stores, and there\u2019s no question it\u2019s driving an improved customer experience and frankly, increased pride among our partner base as we elevate the food program. So very, very healthy results all around. And at our investor conference this fall, we look forward to telling you about what the next wave of that looks like as we\u2019ll go deeper into our expanding lunch program at that point in time.", "In the U.S. stores, and I\u2019ll make a comment, Cliff may jump in here, but what has been one of the most phenomenal stories for us in the past year or two or three has been first recovery several years ago but now the phenomenal returns we\u2019re seeing from new store growth and acceleration of that growth in our U.S. and broadly in the Americas, but specifically within the big system of the U.S.", "The new store formats, flagship stores as Howard spoke about earlier, footprints that allow us to reach traffic that we never had access to previously, all are contributing as we\u2019re growing the system to an opportunity in the U.S. for an accelerating store growth both this year, which you saw in our revised targets today, but as we go into the coming years ahead, beyond any expectation we had previously. You\u2019ll see us continue to drive more stores throughout the U.S. in addition to day part expansion, comp growth, and increasing margin expansion and return on capital across the system. We\u2019re very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing across new stores in the U.S. market.", "Clifford Burrows ", "I think I\u2019d only add two other things. The opportunity that we identified a couple of years ago around drive-thru, that continues to strengthen. And I think the other thing is the geographic opportunity across a wide geography of the U.S. is what encourages us that this is a really good base to build on. ", "And Troy said it, with the quality of the real estate and our absolute discipline maintaining our sales to investment ratio of two to one, and I also think the design quality, the team we have now, and you\u2019ve seen some great stores around the globe, but some of the stores we\u2019re now opening - you know, New Orleans in Canal Street is just phenomenal. Disney, Anaheim, just wonderful, wonderful stores that are really stretching those and giving us an opportunity to attract new customers and give us locations that we\u2019re incredibly proud of. And customers are reacting so well to these new locations.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird ", "Scott, I had a question about the comments you made in reference to the fiscal 2015 guidance. I think you referenced some investments that you\u2019re planning to make, and I was wondering if you could elaborate on those and potentially the magnitude of those investments. And then secondly, if you could talk about, I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about the ability to carve out some costs out of the P&L through productivity and efficiencies. And I was wondering if those might start to kick in next year and offset some of those investments.", "Scott Maw", "On the first part of that question, we make a number of investments across the business to make sure that we can continue to drive the growth that you saw in this quarter, and so far this year. And those include things that we\u2019ve talked about before, around digital investments, technology investments, investments in our partners and in the stores, some of the things Howard talked about around innovation, around store design. All of that is an ongoing thing that\u2019s there to some level every year.", "As we look forward to next year, there are some of those areas where we\u2019ll go a little bit farther, where we see an opportunity to extend our lead. For example, in digital card and mobile. We see things that we can do there. We\u2019re going to support that with the right level of investment.", "Obviously, the overall revenue growth is more than offsetting that. We\u2019re still expanding margin. But we\u2019ll continue to set aside that amount of investment as we see fit, as we go through time. We\u2019ll be more specific as we get through the fourth quarter and finalize our operating plan. We\u2019ll be able to sort of articulate a bit more about what those investments are. But that\u2019s the general scope of what we\u2019re talking about.", "And we do have, baked into the numbers that we\u2019ve shown you, an increase in a leverage, particularly around cost of goods sold and working capital, which we\u2019ve talked some about. So when you look at the target, every year we come out with a target for our supply chain organization. They\u2019ve done a tremendous job of hitting those targets.", "But when we look at the targets that we\u2019ve set for next year across a number of different factors, we\u2019ve actually taken that up significantly, and that\u2019s contributing to the overall range that we\u2019ve provided.", "Troy Alstead", "Let me punctuate a comment Scott made, and that is that we are very, very bullish about the fourth quarter ahead, and about fiscal 2015. The targets we provided to you today that Scott\u2019s outlined reflect another quarter ahead of us as we finish out fiscal 2014 of very, very strong top line growth and earnings growth, earnings per share growth, equal or better than what we just delivered in the third quarter.", "As we move into fiscal 2015 we\u2019re once again committing to double digit revenue growth to earnings per share growth in that 15% to 20% range, which we have consistently delivered for years now. And we can reaffirm that we will keep, as Scott has articulated, investing back into the business to drive that growth, take care of our partners, to make investments to the future, to make sure that this trajectory that we\u2019re on is sustainable. And we anticipate making those investments and delivering another fantastic year ahead.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein ", "", "I actually wanted to ask a question on digital and mobile. Essentially, I think a couple of calls ago, or maybe last call, there was talk about potentially other retailers being interested in using the Starbucks platform. You know, white labeling I think. Could you talk about whether there\u2019s anything else to update us on? I mean, from the perspective of what you might think of as offering from a Starbucks ecosystem around that or where you\u2019re going longer term with that?", "Matt Ryan", "We can tell you right now that we are in a series of very active conversations on this with both technology and financial services companies that would be potential partners here. And while those conversations are going on, I can\u2019t tell you the specifics of them, but what I can tell you is we remain absolutely confident in the nature of the opportunity here, both in terms of what we\u2019ve started with mobile loyalty as a platform as well as the appeal of stars as currency.", "And I\u2019ll leave it at that, and you\u2019ll hear more from us in the future.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley ", "I wanted to ask about digital too, but on the potential for ordering on the mobile platform. Are your stores currently equipped to handle mobile ordering such that there\u2019s technology for the baristas to see an order come in? And some other retailers that have started to do this have seen a work process reengineering, because there\u2019s [unintelligible] that cash register as being the flow meter for products. Suddenly, there\u2019s the potential for a lot more velocity of orders to come in quickly. So are you thinking about labor reallocation in stores as you start to test this? ", "Howard Schultz", "I just want to frame this issue for you. I think at our core, the hallmark of everything we\u2019ve done for now, 40-plus years, has been the customer experience. We want to do everything we can as a company historically and in the future of really not becoming a fast food classic QSR company. And so the experience of Starbucks is really based on customized beverages and really creating this third place between home and work. And we\u2019ve created that now around the world.", "It\u2019s clear to us in our research that express order and pay is a big, big idea, and a big enough idea that can create significant incrementality if done right. And I think the operative phrase here is, \u201cif done right.\u201d This is not something we are coming to overnight. This is something that has been very thoughtful, very disciplined, and part of the digital team of people, wide swath of people, looking at this to ensure the fact that not only do we deliver the capability, but we do it in a way that does not dilute the integrity of the Starbucks experience. ", "And I can tell you unequivocally that Cliff and his team are going to execute this in a way that is going to be seamless and accretive to the Starbucks experience. ", "Clifford Burrows ", "Thanks, Howard, and the opportunity that our mobile MSR platform affords is just incredible, because we know the customers, they know how to use that technology in our stores, and I really see this as a great enhancement.", "As you can imagine, we\u2019ve got a lot of people working on this to make sure the input comes in in the right place, the production falls into line with our regular rhythms, and that we are very clear on the handoff, how do we keep that interaction between our barista and the customer.", "And really, it enhances the relationship we have with the customers, and we think this is going to be just such a great opportunity to increase capacity in stores at peak and just find new ways to fit into customers\u2019 lives. And we\u2019re going to do a significant market test before the holiday, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll learn from this and very rapidly then we\u2019ll start to roll out.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. ", "Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo", "First, I have just a quick follow on question from earlier, on Fizzio. Could you quantify any potential lift you saw in the quarter, and the lift you\u2019re ultimately expecting. And I\u2019d be curious to hear if you think it\u2019s in fact attracting new customers or primarily driving additional day parts.", "And then I was hoping you could talk about any new relationships you\u2019re forming and distribution agreements you\u2019re signing to build your multibillion dollar global coffee packaged business, and what you\u2019re looking for in these partners, especially as you try to increase your global points of distribution, which actually could prove to be quite challenging.", "Howard Schultz ", "We had the real benefit of testing Fizzio. We tried to test it kind of under the radar, but many of you heard about it and saw it. That was last summer in Atlanta and Austin, and Tokyo and Singapore. So we had a lot of insight, a lot of knowledge, and we saw firsthand that we were creating something that had a day part opportunity and a refreshment need state that was beyond and accretive to Starbucks core products and core morning day parts.", "And that is what\u2019s playing out. In addition to that, as Cliff said earlier, the food attachment that is linked to refreshment beverages, I think, is going to prove to be a plus for Starbucks. And with have certainly seen that with shaken iced tea on the Teavana side, and now with Fizzio. It\u2019s still early. I can tell you we\u2019re enthusiastic. ", "It\u2019s a proprietary machine. I think our customers really like the fact - and this is something we saw in test and we\u2019re seeing it play out - in addition to the three Fizzio flavors, not unlike almost everything we do at Starbucks, our customers are now responding on their own and creating their own customizable carbonated beverage that is not even close to anything we\u2019re offering. ", "", "So we\u2019re seeing an opportunity to leverage carbonation beyond the initial flavor profile. And this is something part and parcel with Frappuccino for 20 years. And it\u2019s very interesting. It\u2019s exciting, and we\u2019re just giving it to the customer and let them be in control. And that\u2019s benefitting Starbucks.", "With regard to packaged coffee and global partnerships, I\u2019ll give that to John.", "John Culver", "Today, we operate in 30 countries selling our either packaged goods or ready to drink product. Right now we\u2019re really focused on continuing to expand both the partnerships, but then also our opportunity for distribution in new countries, as well as going deeper in our existing countries. We\u2019ve seen strong performance in China, in the U.K., in Canada this year, which is driving our international growth. And we continue to look at opportunities for business partnerships who have capabilities in the areas of manufacturing, in the areas of sales, also in the area of distribution as we identify potential business relationships.", "But this is an area that we are investing heavily in as a company. We see it as a future growth driver for the channel development business, since we\u2019re only in about half of our total markets we\u2019re in around the world. ", "Howard Schultz ", "We\u2019ve always believed that we had to be able to create the equity of that Starbucks brand in our retail stores first, create kind of impressions, the economies of scale, and the emotional connection in our stores, and then sequentially, as a result of that, be able to create new channels of distribution.", "And as a result of that, the success we\u2019re seeing, and you saw it this quarter, is a result of the equity in the Starbucks brand being now available in places where people can find coffee and other Starbucks products where they shop for food.", "And you know, I\u2019ve said this before, but we are probably the only traditional four-wall, bricks and mortar retailer that has now created multiple channels of distribution outside of our store base. One reason for that is we\u2019re a company owned system, so we don\u2019t have the franchise relationships, and we\u2019re not encumbered by them. But the other thing is the fact that our customers want Starbucks coffee and related products outside of our stores.", "And when you look at comps of Starbucks at 7% U.S., what\u2019s not in the P&L, and probably was not in our remarks, is not only are we achieving 7% comps on a base of 6,800 stores, but we\u2019re also self-cannibalizing many, many things that we sell in our stores by having 100,000 points of distribution of Starbucks coffee and related products throughout the United States.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan ", " ", "La Boulange and Evolution Fresh are about to be fully national within the company, at least the company store base within the U.S. Does this give you an as of yet taken advantage opportunity to market nationally the improvement and differentiation of these product lines? I ask this in the context, as I was surprised to see Teavana Shaken Tea on television these past months, and I was curious how advertising that product in a fairly new way did, and if you might see a similar reaction to some of your other sub-brands.", "Howard Schultz ", "Let\u2019s talk about Teavana fist, because I think it\u2019s a very interesting case test and study. When we acquired Teavana, the going in assumption was we\u2019ve got a $90 billion category that we believe was ripe for innovation. But we also had the inherent benefit of the opportunity to not only expand Teavana traditional stores in the U.S. and around the world - and I think over time, it will prove out that Teavana\u2019s greatest strength is going to be outside of the U.S. But that\u2019s for another day.", "But I think the benefit going in was the fact that we believed that we could create significant incrementality inside Starbucks. Our tea business, before the acquisition, was less than half of 1% in Starbucks stores. ", "By leveraging the Teavana brand and the quality of the tea, we are building a new category inside Starbucks. We\u2019re seeing significant growth in tea as a result of Teavana and Oprah Chai. But the real benefit is not only inside Starbucks, but the halo and the fact that we\u2019re creating awareness, we\u2019re creating a unique opportunity to build the Teavana retail brand as well.", "So the advertising benefit is we\u2019re not only getting a return on the investment of advertising Teavana Shaken Tea in our stores, but we\u2019re getting the added benefit of being able to communicate the benefit of going into Teavana stores. And this is just the beginning. ", "With regard to Evolution, we haven\u2019t talked about this in a while, but you know, a while back we announced a relationship and a partnership with Dannon. And in calendar 2015, you\u2019ll see the benefits of the partnership of Dannon, which will be integrated into Evolution products in yogurt.", "Troy Alstead", "And today, Evolution sits in over 12,000 points of distribution, whether it\u2019s through our retail stores or down the aisle.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan ", " ", "And do you have an opportunity to put La Boulange on television, once that gets further along into your stores, in terms of how big that will be within the system?", "Clifford Burrows ", "No, La Boulange, for us, was the credibility and the base to grow quality pastries and that morning day part within Starbucks stores. Over time, it is about the full array of food that we serve at Starbucks, some of which will be pastries and some of those other day parts that Howard talked about earlier.", "And obviously the big opportunity is to have food that complements our beverages. So the beverage will drive and the food will support that. We wanted to make sure that as we invested in food that we had great quality food that matches the customer expectation. And that\u2019s the role La Boulange has played in that morning day part.", "Operator", "The next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.", "Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer ", "Can you remind us what percentage of the company operated stores have drive-thrus today? And on top of that, I\u2019d really like to hear what inning you think you\u2019re in on your speed and throughput opportunities at the drive-thru, and whether you view throughput at the drive-thru as a meaningful comp opportunity going forward, still as we sit here today.", "Clifford Burrows ", "We have just under about 50% of our company operated stores are drive-thru. In the new stores that we\u2019re opening, it is more than half of them, with the current year are going to be drive-thru. So it is a growing part of our portfolio. We have seen considerable improvement in throughput, and the drive-thru stores have been strong contributors to comp, both in the drive-thru lane and also in the in-store experience as well. And that\u2019s because we\u2019ve really focused on how do we serve the two customer need states.", "We talked several calls ago about an enhanced drive-thru experience, and that really is we\u2019re going to have the opportunity to have face-to-face conversations with customers through technology and through digital, enhancing the experience for the customer, both in terms of how they order and how they pay in drive-thru, and how they keep out of the rain in those drive-thru lanes.", "So all of those are investments we have tested. Really encouraged by it. And really, it will be three years we will do that rollout. Some will be on cycle renovation, and some will be to speed it up, where that opportunity exists.", "So I think it\u2019s fair to say drive-thru will be a significant contributor, and it\u2019s an opportunity for comp. The good news is customer feedback, and what they\u2019re telling us, is the drive-thru experience is really important to them, because we meet them where they\u2019re at. It is not how they build the relationship, but that convenience and the ability for a mother to be in the car with her kids rather than offload the family is important. And the morning commuter.", "So drive-thru is a focus. It has been a contributor to our comps over recent years, and it will continue to be so.", "Troy Alstead", "I want to add to Cliff\u2019s comments, because it\u2019s very important to step back and put several pieces together here. We just delivered a 7% comp growth in the U.S., across a huge system. Nobody with a system the size of this, with these volumes, at that age of portfolio, is delivering that kind of sustainable comp growth and driving margin expansion at the same time, while opening stores, while expanding our license footprint, and while expanding our CPG business in that same huge geography.", "And things such as drive-thru and all the effort that Cliff and his team have put into enhancing the drive-thru experience to improving the flow-through and the speed of the car stack, the experience of the customer through drive-thru, has contributed, over the last years, and certainly in this quarter we just reported, that very, very strong comp growth, just as has the investments we\u2019ve made in food and beverage innovation, in the MSR program.", "What you\u2019re seeing is the coming together of all these very strategic investments in the core of our business, and the brand, and the experience, and the product offering, and the channels of distribution, contributing to what is a world-class and quite a rare delivery of same-store sales growth through the big U.S. system.", "Operator", "The last question comes from Jason West of Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank ", " ", "Just going back to 2015 outlook, Scott, I believe that in the past you guys have provided some color on the margins that are embedded in the guidance. I don\u2019t know if you could offer any color on that for 2015. And just on the commodity piece, what you\u2019re assuming there for the unhedged portion. Are you kind of taking the current spot prices or futures, or are you making some other assumptions?", "Scott Maw", "On the first part, obviously consolidated margin will expand, just given the relationship of revenue growth and overall EPS growth. We\u2019re not going to give quite yet the individual business unit margin results. We\u2019ll wrap up our annual operating plan over the next couple of months, and then the fourth quarter will be far more specific about what we expect by each business unit.", "As far as coffee goes, it\u2019s a good question. So we have about 60% of our coffee needs price locked for next year. And those prices are roughly flat to this year, up perhaps a little bit. Where we actually end up for the year, we still think it will be roughly neutral, but it will depend on how we lock in that last 40%.", "So right now, we\u2019re thinking neutral, perhaps up a little bit. If coffee prices come down, there may be an opportunity to ease that a bit.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank ", "But where the coffee futures are today would be sort of in line with that flat to up slightly? ", "Scott Maw", "Yeah, I mean, where we\u2019ve locked in is what it\u2019s in line - where we end up with that, that last 40%, will determine how much we swing within that range.

The event kicks off Wednesday evening with the reception at our new roastery, which we are very excited to unveil, followed on Thursday by presentations and onsite experiences here at our headquarter. Please contact Investor Relations if you need more information and we hope to see you here in early December.", "With that, let me turn the call over Howard.", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. Starbucks record Q4 and fiscal 2014 financial and operating results again demonstrate the power and relevancy of the Starbucks brand and the success and scalability of our operating strategies and global business model.", "Meaningful contributions from each of our business units drove a better than 10% increase in Q4 revenues, to a record $4.2 billion, while improved store operations enabled us to deliver an elevated experience for our customers and our 19th consecutive quarter of comp store sales growth at or above 5%.", "Sales leverage, increased operating efficiency and disciplined expense management, each contributed to 280 basis point increase in operating margin over last year, to a record 20.5% and a 23% increase in non-GAAP earnings to a Q4 record of $0.74 per share.", "For the full fiscal year Starbucks grew revenues by 11% to a record $16.4 billion, posted global comp store sales growth of 6%, squarely in line with our targets and grew non-GAAP EPS by 21% to a record $2.66 per share.", "Starbucks performance in fiscal 2014 was extraordinary by any metric or comparison and results remain even more stunning by the fact that they were achieved in the face of continued challenging retail and consumer environments, the accelerating shift in consumer behavior from bricks and mortar to ecommerce purchasing and on the heels of 7% comp growth in fiscal \u201913.", "I\u2019ve spent many of these calls discussing the quarter or year ahead, but today I am going to leave that to Troy and Scott, and instead lay out for you a roadmap that demonstrates how Starbucks is positioned to benefit from the massive cultural shift in consumer behavior underway and how we will continue to lead, thrive and win in fiscal 2015 and beyond.", "The most meaningful changes are long-term game changers, but I will begin with the immediate plans that will drive results this holiday. For this holiday season, officially starting for millions of consumers in the U.S. and around the world this Saturday, when Starbucks cups turn red. We have completely re-imagined our in-store experience.", "We have great seasonal offerings from La Boulange and are introducing an innovative new handcrafted beverage, chestnut praline latte, a beverage that resonated strongly with customers in test markets and will add incrementality as the next iconic holiday beverage and we reoriented our approach to gifting.", "Last holiday, Starbucks benefited enormously from the consumer shift towards gift, gift giving cards, instead of traditional physical goods. For us that translated into a record card sales, roughly one in eight Americans receiving a Starbucks gift card and 1.4 billion in Q1 card loads last fiscal year.", "This holiday we will create even more passion and excitement for Starbucks gift cards by offering 100 beautiful unique and proprietary new card designs, merchandize on an engaging freestanding card wall and supported by social media to encourage engagement and peer-to-peer sharing, and we will have greatly expanded our ecommerce merchandizing offerings as well.", "But the big driver this year is our promotional overlay of Starbucks for Life. During the five-week period beginning December 2nd at the heart of the Christmas shopping season, every customer who uses a gift card or their MSR account to pay can win one of almost 500,000 food and beverage prizes, and 13 lucky card folders in North America will win Starbucks for Life.", "Now customers have been trying to buy Starbucks for Life for decades, but we have never offered it and you still can\u2019t buy it. But this holiday season 13 Starbucks cardholders who are MSR members will win it.", "Our Starbucks for Life promotion and external marketing plans will ignite social media channels through our customers into our stores and drive significant loyalty into the flywheel of Starbucks.", "Today Starbucks is approaching 1,400 stores in China and customer engagement with our brand has never been stronger. We continue to expand and leverage our mobile, digital and loyalty assets, and become an increasing relevant part of the daily ritual for rapidly growing customer base.", "As a result, Starbucks comp growth in China routinely outpaces segment comp growth in China overall and with passionate world-class senior leaders and store partners drawn from local communities within China and demand for all things Starbucks in China so strong, we are now opening an average of one new store everyday, a pace that will only accelerate for years to come. These are still the early days of Starbucks growth and development in China despite the fact that is one of our strongest markets in the world.", "Turning to Japan, last month we entered into an agreement to acquire shares in Starbucks Japan we did not already owned. Opened in 1996 in our first country market outside of North America, Japan today represents over 1,000 stores.", "Beside being EPS accretive in year one, when completed the transaction will enable us to increase the pace of new store openings that have benefited us in U.S., China and certainly other markets around the world, and expand the availability of Starbucks products in multiple CPG channels. We will also be able to leverage more fully our loyalty, digital, mobile and new product development programs in Japan.", "Turning to EMEA, I\u2019m pleased to report that our EMEA business has been transformed and turned around, just as we had promised, and that Q4 represented EMEA\u2019s best quarter in years, with particularly strong performance in the U.K., as good as Q4 was you will continue to see the EMEA get even better in the quarters ahead.", "Now, let me turn to coffee, for years we have dreamed of a single place where would capture all the passion, all the ambition, all the magic of coffee in one extraordinary dynamic space. Those of you who come to Seattle for our Investment Day -- Investor Day in December we will see that vision come to life in the most unique and extraordinary consumer experience ever seen, the Starbucks roastery and tasting room.", "The roastery will shine a bright light on everything Starbucks, it will seamlessly integrate coffee roasting and food, beverage and merchandize retailing into an immersive consumer experience that showcases Starbucks coffee heritage, the craft of small batch roasting and innovative new coffee brewing methods, culminating in each cup of coffee being handcrafted right from the roasting.", "We will combine the beauty and romance of super premium micro-lot coffees with moments of connection and discovery for our customers. But, perhaps, the greatest value of the roastery is that it will anchor a new Starbucks super premium coffee sub-brand Starbucks Reserve, identified not by the Starbucks brand itself but by a capital R and Star that defines the upper limit of what is possible in coffee just as other authentic super premium brands have done in other industries and formed the foundation for an entirely new Starbucks reserve retail store platform and business unit.", "The first of hundred or more reserve stores we plan to open around the world, we will be opening in San Francisco very soon. And the roastery would be the first of several we plan to open in select markets around the world, beginning in fiscal 2016.", "Beyond the experience itself, the proprietary design, technology and capacity we have built into the roastery will enable us to substantially increase production of rare and limited availability coffees and to double the number of Starbucks stores, offering packaged Starbucks reserve coffees to 1500 worldwide by the end of fiscal \u201815.", "And I can assure you that no other coffee company in the world will be able to offer higher quality coffees in a coffee labeled Starbucks Reserve. With the roastery and with Starbucks Reserve, Starbucks will further elevate the premium end of the coffee industry, extend our coffee leadership and authority and create further separation from every other coffee company in the world.", "Let me turn to Teavana. The Teavana acquisition provided Starbucks with unique entree into the $90 billion global hot and iced tea category, a category we feel strongly is ripe for innovation and reinvention. Last year, we opened our first Teavana Tea Bar on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side and we now have a total of 60 Teavana tea bars.", "I was at the opening of our newest New York City Teavana Tea Bar on 9th Street and Broadway just last week and was taken by the energy and customer excitement in the store. I urge you all to visit the store yourself and envision a national and global footprint of Teavana stores that Starbucks will create.", "Sales of handcrafted Teavana beverages such as Teavana Oprah Chai and Teavana Shaken Iced Tea and sale of Teavana premium loose-leaf teas through Starbuck\u2019s global store base were always a core strategic focus of the acquisition. Today we are already seeing Teavana products drive incrementality at Starbucks stores in North America. At the same time, they build brand awareness and add new customers for Teavana. In fact, Teavana Shaken Iced teas were the single most profitable addition to our menu last year.", "Now let me comment on digital card, mobile, loyalty and payments. I want to talk to you about the intersection of three powerful consumer trends, the convergence of which bodes extremely well for Starbucks over the long term. The shift in consumer behavior that has people spending less time shopping in bricks-and-mortar stores and more time online that I first discussed with you after Q1.", "The established long-term trend of people consuming more and more food and beverage away from home and the tremendous growth of online activity from mobile devices allowing consumers to conveniently conduct their lives including commerce from wherever they happen to be.", "What\u2019s actually occurring is the cultural shift in time allocation, away from retail experiences people have felt forced to undertake and towards retail experiences that people want to enjoy with convenience as the key enabler. Starbucks is uniquely well positioned to benefit from this convergence as the destination experience. Visiting Starbucks has always been an elective choice, a place people choose to freak with and as a result the place that is vastly less dependent on intercepting retail traffic for sales growth.", "The relevance of the Starbucks\u2019 experience, the desirability of our coffee and food and the ambience and feeling of community within our stores sets us apart from our competitors and our unique drivers that will continue to support our growth.", "On top of this, we continue to see consumers favor retailers who improve their customer experience through the integration of convenient mobile technology. And while Starbucks is today an uncontested leader in mobile, we will continue to innovate and lead around all things mobile in order to attract additional users of our app and provide an enhance and simplified experience for our customers. Innovations that will drive traffic and incrementality and create further attachment and customer engagement.", "By way of example in September, we launched our new Starbucks app for android with Shake to Pay functionality in the U.S., U.K. and Canada and also digital tipping in the U.S. as Starbucks iOS app now has Uber integration, enabling customers to click on a ride to their local servers.", "But perhaps the single most important technology innovation, we will introduce this year is Mobile Order and Pay which debuts in Portland in December and will be rolled out nationwide in 2015. And while many people are talking about Mobile and Pay, what Starbucks is going to do and execute is quite different than anyone else in the market place.", "Consumer\u2019s today are no longer willing to accept convenience only around the purchase of readily available or commodity based products. They want convenience around the purchase of premium products like Starbucks as well. One way, we are addressing that need is to accelerate the expansion at Starbucks portfolio of high profitable drive-through source.", "But our research confirms that we can drive even more traffic and incrementality and offer even more customers more convenience in more locations by allowing them to place orders ahead of time via their mobile devices and pick their orders up without waiting in line.", "Starbucks\u2019 Mobile Order and Pay is a totally unique technology. It seamlessly integrates mobile ordering and our proprietary loyalty program with point of sale and store operations enable us to enhance our customer experience, exceed our customer\u2019s expectations or convenience and extend customer loyalty.", "And as you will see in a few weeks, no company in any industry offers any technology remotely like Starbucks\u2019 Mobile Order and Pay plus we get the added benefit of increased store throughput and speed of service for all our customers. And we will drive a further step change in customer loyalty and engagement by extending express order and pay to include food and beverage delivery, yes, food and beverage delivery in select markets during the second half of 2015.", "Imagine the ability to create a standing order that Starbucks delivered hot or iced to your desk daily, that\u2019s our version of ecommerce on steroids. All this will grow Starbucks Rewards, our loyalty program that now has 8 million active members up 23% over Q4 last year and has been launched in 26 countries. And we will roll out and enhance My Starbucks rewards program, providing even greater benefits to members in 2015, further accelerating MSR membership growth. And we have several initiatives underway that will grow membership in a short term and surprise and delight our customers.", "Finally, while we have been investing in the development of our world class mobile technologies for many years and there has been a great deal of activity and speculation around the mobile payment base recently. Mobile payment and consumer adoption of the technology overall is still in its infancy.", "Please consider this metric. In 2013, payment for purchases by use of all mobile devices in the U.S. totaled $1.3 billion that was the entire market. Now listen to this. With over 90% of those purchases taking place in a Starbucks store, that means we had 90% share of mobile payments in 2013 while bricks-and-mortar commerce in 2013 totaled more than $4.2 trillion.", "Now what you\u2019re going to see in the years ahead will be a rapid acceleration in mobile device purchases and a continued significant migration away from bricks-and-mortar commerce. There is obviously a huge prize there and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing so much activity around the payment space from all kinds of companies.", "That\u2019s why every tech in financial service company in the world is totally, is today chasing the mobile payment opportunity. Yet while these companies may have vast hardware and software development capabilities and this is the key point here. Starbucks is the only local, national or global business of any kind to succeed in crossing both the most difficult and the most critical CASM standing between success and failure in mobile payment, transforming consumer behavior. We\u2019ve accomplished this by integrating the convenience of mobile payment to a compelling and enjoyable program that gives our customers rewards.", "Already close to 7 million transactions per week, 16% of all transactions conducted in U.S. Starbucks stores occurs via customers use of a mobile device. No company and no retail store domestically or internationally even comes close. And while that figure has been growing by almost 50% per year, the real growth is yet to come.", "Starbucks Coffee Company has cracked the code at tying mobile payments to loyalty and we are now receiving great interest in partnerships from mobile payment companies who see the value of our rewards program and the mobile payment behavior we established. But we will play our hand wisely with a long-term view, carefully choosing our partners and how we leverage our assets to take advantage of the revenue and profit opportunities in loyalty and mobile payment ahead. But I can assure you that Starbucks will have a major role to play, both inside and outside of our stores as the nascent mobile payment industry evolves.", "On Veterans Day, November 11th, just two weeks from now, in keeping with Starbucks\u2019 values and guiding principles and in conjunction with the publication next week of a book I coauthored with Rajiv Chandrasekaran, For Love of Country, where our Veterans can teach us about citizenships, heroism and sacrifice. Starbucks, HBO and Chase will be hosting a free, nationally televised concert on the Mall in Washington DC to honor our veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, who have given so much so we may enjoy our freedom, our families and our lives.", "Over 200,000 people are expected on the Mall, with an A-list performer list which includes, Bruce Springsteen, Rihanna, Eminem, Carrie Underwood and many others. Don't miss it.", "Lastly, we are looking forward to welcoming many of you as JoAnn already shared with you to Seattle for our Biannual Investor Day on December 4th, our first conference in our hometown since 2006, and to sharing with you details around new food and beverage innovations, reimagined store designs and new store formats, Mobile Order and Pay, expansion of our evening programs to drive further incrementality, elevation of our partner and customer experiences and many other initiatives that will demonstrate how Starbucks will continue to grow and to win in fiscal 2015 and long into the future. And I\u2019m beyond thrilled to share with you the spectacular new roaster.", "I will now pass the call over to Troy and Scott to discuss our operating and financial performance in Q4 and fiscal 2014, and provide an update of our fiscal 2015 outlook. But before I do I just want to say one thing. When I look at the results, this is not on the script. When I look at the results of this year, the stunning accomplishments on so many levels, I hear somebody is disappointed with a 5% comp on a base of over 7,500 stores. I just got to ask myself, is there any company in your universe putting up these kinds of numbers? And the answer is no.", "And I call tell you from my point of view and for everyone involved at Starbucks, we are just getting started. Troy?", "Troy Alstead", "Thanks, Howard and good afternoon everyone. 2014 was an incredibly strong and record year for Starbucks across the board. Each of our reportable segments set new fourth quarter records to revenue and operating income. The results we reported today are that much more significant when considered against the backdrop of the very soft global retail environment in which they were accomplished.", "The hardwork and dedication of our Starbucks partners has enabled us to be where we are today and we have the solid foundation needed to continue to profitably grow both emerging and existing lines of business into the future. I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 performance for each reporting business, and then turn the discussion over to Scott for additional details, along with an update on targets for fiscal 2015.", "For the total company in the fourth quarter, we produce net revenue of $4.2 billion, up 10% from the same period in fiscal 2013. In a difficult consumer environment, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 5% for the quarter, driven by a 4% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in traffic. And new store openings continued at a healthy pace, with 503 net new stores opened in the fourth quarter.", "In terms of segment results, the Americas net revenue for the quarter was $3.0 billion, a 9% increase over the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 5% increase in comparable store sales, comprised of a 1% increase in traffic and a 4% increase in average ticket. Incremental revenues from 698 net new store openings over the past 12 months also contributed to the growth in revenue.", "While we delivered comparable store sales growth solidly within our stated target range for the consolidated business and all segments, both for the quarter and the year, like others in retail we are feeling the impact of consumer uncertainty in today\u2019s economic environment.", "We are not satisfied with 1% traffic growth in the Americas and are taking immediate steps to grow traffic. I\u2019ll share with you some specific plans to do just that, including some exciting new initiatives launching in the next few weeks. I would like to underscore that we are very encouraged with several key performance indicators in our fourth quarter results that speak to the health of our business.", "First, our new stores are driving incremental traffic, serving untapped demand and for second consecutive year, maintaining record levels of first year performance. These stores are increasingly contributing to traffic and revenue growth, a clear indication that we are opening stores in the right places and in the right formats, which provided for the solid foundation for future growth.", "Second, similar to the third quarter, ticket growth was among the highest in the last several years, with the growth primarily driven by beverage and food mix and attach. Pricing once again contributed 1 point to total comp growth, consistent with the prior four quarters.", "Third, all day parts grew over the prior year and not more than 45% of our traffic is in the morning before 11 a.m. We saw strong growth in the midday between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. This is another encouraging sign that our food and beverage innovations are geared towards expanding the afternoon day part are gaining momentum with customers, which brings me to another key highlight of our fourth quarter performance.", "Food, food again contributed 2 points to Americas comp growth this quarter, representing double-digit revenue growth over the prior year. Our expanded breakfast selling platform drove the majority of the increase in the food comp, bolstered by significantly higher attach rates.", "We are very encouraged that our premium breakfast sandwich platform is performing extremely well. Our bakery and lunch platforms also delivered strong revenue growth. The introduction of two new lunch sandwiches at the end of last quarter has created new interest in all our warm sandwich offerings, which indicates that Starbucks is increasingly recognized by our customers as an attractive option for lunch.", "In addition to sales growth, we achieved margin enhancement from a variety of supply chain improvements. The insights we gained from the rollout of La Boulange bakery and new lunch offerings have enabled us to refine our execution. The most significant impact we are seeing is a reduction in waste, which goes directly to the bottom line.", "We\u2019ve also simplified the work routines in our stores, with the implementation of a food management tool. Our partners have responded positively to the changes and we are seeing the benefit in margin improvement.", "And finally, we continue to analyze our product offerings and make adjustments to ensure that the items we offer are those that will truly make a difference to our customers in terms of routine, relevance and loyalty.", "Our Teavana hand-shaken iced tea helped drive more than 20% growth in our ice tea platform. Overall, we saw double-digit growth in the entire tea category over the fourth quarter last year, with the growth coming from across the entire platform from our base products to our limited-time offerings.", "We are very pleased with the strong performance we\u2019ve seen in the early days of Teavana and Starbucks stores, and we believe that we are at the very nascent stage of what promises to be a tremendous growth opportunity for tea in the future.", "Moving on to our store formats, in the U.S., our high profitable drive-through stores, which account for 42% of our company-operated store portfolio, generated nearly 50% of sales and 55% of total company operated store profits in Q4.", "Drive-throughs achieved comp growth in Q4 that outpaced the overall portfolio, with more than 60% coming from out-the-window sales, reinforcing the importance and relevance of convenience to our customers. We are very encouraged by these results and expect them to grow, as we continue to focus on improving productivity at peak and delivering enhanced customer experience.", "Overall, I am very pleased with the results from our Americas segment. As Scott will discuss in further detail, operating margin for this segment increased a phenomenal 260 basis points over the prior year, a tremendous accomplishment considering the size of the Americas business.", "Now turning to EMEA, where the momentum that has been building all year culminated in a remarkable finish in the fourth quarter. The region delivered strong 10% revenue growth in the quarter, attributable to favorable foreign currency exchange, 5% comp growth and incremental revenue from 171 net new stores opened in the last 12 months.", "This represents the sixth consecutive quarter of positive comps, driven by a 2% lift in traffic and a 2% rise in average ticket. The two-year comp at 7% represents the highest two-year comp in the past three years.", "For second consecutive quarter, the U.K. comp was slightly higher than the overall segment comp growth for the quarter. Major driver of this increase was food, once again driven primarily by up-leveling our breakfast and lunch platforms. Another major market in the EMEA business, Germany, also achieved comp growth that outpaced the regions for second consecutive quarter.", "We are very pleased with these results because it was Germany\u2019s sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp growth. As the store mix of the EMEA portfolio shifts, it\u2019s important to look at how our license stores in that segment are doing. We are very pleased that several licensed markets comped above the segment results for our company operated stores, with two markets reaching double-digit comp growth.", "This further demonstrates the strength of the Starbucks brand across the region where today 62% of our stores in EMEA are licensed. The turnaround in this region has been both remarkable and well-balanced from improving the customer experience to up-leveling product offerings to expanding margin through process and supply chain efficiencies and profitability for restructuring our store portfolio. I am very pleased with the ongoing levels of improvement from our EMEA business and the rapid pace at which the improvement is occurring.", "Turning to the China Asia Pacific region, our fourth quarter results were strong once again. Total net revenue grew 21% to $310 million in Q4, a new all-time record and represents the 17th consecutive quarter with revenue growth in excess of 20%. The largest drivers of this growth were incremental revenue from 742 net new stores opened over the past 12 months and 5% comp growth for the quarter.", "Comp growth was entirely attributable to increased traffic with ticket declining in the quarter partially due to lower sales of seasonal packaged food offerings in China. Most importantly, the region\u2019s strong 6% traffic growth sustained the trend from the third quarter demonstrating the tremendous strength of the Starbucks brand in the CAP region.", "We ended the year with 4,624 stores in the region, including 199 net new stores opened during the fourth quarter. 120 of these new openings were in China, a fourth quarter record. A particular significance is that our new stores in China are exceeding the year one pro forma sales we projected. These results and investments we made across the region including our pending acquisition of Starbucks Japan gives us great confidence and optimism about our future performance in the CAP segment.", "Finally to channel development, the momentum we saw in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. This segment achieved a new record for quarterly revenue, almost $400 million resulting in 12% growth over the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by sales of K-Cups, which rose 26% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the strength of core product sales and success of the product innovation and limited-time offerings.", "Our flavors platform grew with the introduction of two new flavors in July; cinnamon dolce and mocha. Our seasonal limited-time offering Fall Blend was also successful. We are pleased that our diverse portfolio of K-Cup offerings contribute to our leadership position down the aisle in premium at-home coffee.", "We are confident we can maintain our market leading position in premium packaged roasting ground coffee as well despite the continuing shift in consumer preference towards single serve coffee and our strong position in that category. Continuing innovation combined with our unique unmatched cross-channel My Starbucks Rewards program are the keys driving that continued leadership position. In fiscal 2014, 1.5 million of the 8 million members of our loyalty program earned stars through the grocery channel.", "And now to recap our full year 2014 results which were also very impressive. At the consolidated level, we achieved record revenue, operating income and operating margin. Consolidated revenue for fiscal 2014 increased 11% to $16.4 billion. The increase was primarily due to a 6% increase in comparable store sales comprised of a 3% increase in traffic and a 3% increase in average ticket.", "Incremental revenues from 1,599 net new stores opened over the past 12 months also contributed to the growth in revenue. Of the new stores we opened, 1,029 were licensed demonstrating the strength of the Starbucks brand and the valuable licensed partnerships we have established around the world.", "We achieved a number of major milestones in 2014. We completed the La Boulange Bakery rollout in all company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. We announced the planned acquisition of Starbucks Japan, our first international market outside of North America and our channel development business delivered both double-digit top and bottomline growth for the year.", "We shipped approximately 750 million K-Cups during 2014 giving us confidence that we can reach the 1 billion mark in 2015. As we move into 2015, our priorities for our food program will be to continue to lean in on the success of our breakfast sandwiches, evolve our lunch program by introducing new items and add several hundred evening stores as we move the program into the full launch phase that thoughtfully leverages the insights we gain during the test period.", "On digital front, we will be intently focused on learning from the Mobile Order and Pay pilot we will be launching in December in anticipation of the full U.S. rollout later in calendar 2015. We will demonstrate our commitment to staying ahead of the ship to e-commerce through a completely reimagined in-store holiday experience. We will continue to grow our coffee leadership position in our stores and at-home through star formats and product innovation that is relevant for our customers, including the roastery and the forthcoming Starbucks reserve sub-brand and stores.", "We will create new occasion through our T platform. We will roll the Starbucks with innovative store design and formats. We will complete the acquisition and the integration of Starbucks Japan and begin unleashing new growth opportunities in that market. And we will begin rolling out the first phase of a multi-year investment in the partners experience.", "This will include higher start rates in all U.S. markets starting in January, a new performance recognition or award mechanism, improved shift schedules, the introduction of a food benefit and continued expansion of the Starbucks College Achievement Plan through Arizona State University. During our investor day in Seattle on December 4th we will provide additional debt on these initiatives and much, much more. (Indiscernible).", "I will now turn the call over to Scott to provide more details on the fourth quarter and full year 2014, as well as our 2015 target.", "Scott Maw", "Thanks, Troy, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter and full year 2014 saw strong financial growth and profitability for Starbucks. Our results were once again driven by the customer experience delivered by our partners around the world. Q4 revenue grew 10% and our strong comps store sales of 5% once again showed the strength of our brand in a difficult environment.", "One of the most significant financial items to highlight is the 280 basis point increase in non-GAAP operating margin reflecting our ongoing ability to leverage operating cost and control cost of goods sold. This is the highest level of non-GAAP operating margin expansion we have driven in nearly four years.", "Before I go into specifics, I want to ensure that everyone is clear on what we are including in our non-GAAP adjustments for comparison purposes. For both 2013 and 2014, we have excluded charges and adjustments related to the Kraft litigation. We have also excluded gains, losses and cost from certain transactions related to equity interest and retail operations in specific geographies. You can see the amounts, timing and description of these items in the detailed reconciliation table provided at the end of the earnings release. I recommend you review that in conjunction with our results.", "Operating income from each of our reportable segments reached new all-time highs contributing up to margin expansion I mentioned earlier. Our fourth quarter results across the segments to have anther of strong growth with earnings per share of $0.77 on a GAAP basis. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.74 which is the highest we have ever achieved in a single quarter. This represents 23% growth over the prior year non-GAAP EPS.", "On the segment basis operating income in the Americas grew to 743 million up 23% over the prior fourth quarter. Operating margin expansion of 260 basis points reaching 24.4% was primarily driven by significant sales leverage. Effective inventory management and our scores primarily the result of reducing product waste and lower commodity costs also contributed to the margin improvement.", "In EMEA, we continue to deliver strong results that demonstrate that the transformation work over the past few years is truly taking hold. Fourth quarter operating income for this segment was 30%, a 42% increase over the fourth quarter which translated into a 12.1% operating margin. This is EMEA\u2019s first quarter ever of double-digit margins. This resulted in a 280 basis point expansion in operating margin over the prior year primarily driven by sales leverage and continued expense management.", "Now let\u2019s turn to China Asia Pacific. For a second consecutive quarter this segment delivered operating income in excess of $100 million. This was an 8% increase over last year, which translated into a 33.5% operating margin and was driven by balanced performance across the region. Operating margin declined 400 basis points primarily due to a 210 basis points favorable impact to last quarter\u2019s fourth quarter margin from a reduction in the estimated asset retirement obligations for store leases. The ongoing shift in our store portfolio composition to more company-operated stores also contributed to the margin decline.", "Operating profit for channel development grew 34% in Q4 over the prior year to a record $172 million and operating margin was 43%, a 690 basis point increase over last year. Significant topline growth due to strong sales of single serve products coupled with favorable coffee costs and other cost of goods sold efficiencies drove the operating income and margin improvement.", "The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 36.4%. The combined impact of selling our ownership interest in Malaysia and Australia increased the rate by about 2%.", "Our full year results for 2014 were equally impressive. Consolidated global net revenues reached a record $16 billion in fiscal 2014. The 11% revenue growth over fiscal 2013 coupled with our EPS growth this year represents the third straight year that we have grown revenues double-digit and non-GAAP EPS over 15%.", "Our fiscal 2014 consolidated operating income of over $3 billion represents a 25% increase on a non-GAAP basis from last year, including over 15% operating income growth in all reportable segments. Relative to the prior year, operating margin increased 210 basis points for fiscal 2014 on a non-GAAP basis, primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs.", "We added nearly 1,600 net new stores in 2014 with about 70% of those stores outside of the U.S., once again reflecting broad and balanced growth around the world. Cash flows from operations remain very strong and we\u2019ve returned a record $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, up 32% from 2013. This reflects our significant cash generation capability and balance sheet strength.", "And today, we announced that our Board has approved a 23% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.32 a share. Looking ahead to 2015, we will see significant continued revenue growth including the impact of Japan, our largest acquisition network. We expect this acquisition will move our consolidated revenues up over $19 billion as we take full control of the already successful Japanese market.", "We will also increase investments in critical area such as store partner pay in benefits, coffee leadership and innovation such as the roastery and digital capabilities including Mobile Order and Pay. Finally, we will have a renewed focus on driving increased leverage in both cost of goods sold and G&A expenses. And all of this will be achieved while we continue to focus on product innovation and customer service that has driven our industry leading performance few times.", "Before I discuss 2015 targets, I want to highlight certain non-GAAP adjustments related to fiscal 2015 for comparison purposes. In addition to the 2014 items I mentioned earlier, 2015 non-GAAP earnings numbers will exclude several adjustments related to the Japan acquisition. Specifically, we have excluded from our comparison the significant acquisition relating gain we will recognize in Q1 resulting from the fair value adjustment of our current ownership interest in Starbucks Japan.", "We expect this gain will be approximately $325 million to $375 million after-tax and will increase first quarter earnings by $0.43 to $0.49 per share. Also, non-GAAP results will exclude the amortization from acquired intangible assets and yield related transaction and integration costs, which will flow through the P&L throughout 2015.", "These are all estimates and we will firm up the final amounts related to the gain and the amortization of the intangible assets in Q1. Again, we have provided a summary of these adjustments in a table at the end of our earnings release. Also given the significant financial impact of the Japan acquisition on the CAP segment in consolidated results, we are holding a separate conference call to address questions related to this on November 5th at 9 A.M. eastern time. Given this please limit your questions today on the Starbucks Japan transaction to strategic and business related items as we will differ financial and modeling related questions to the call next week.", "We expect fiscal 2015 revenue growth will be 16% to 18%, including over $1 billion in incremental revenue from the Japan acquisition. We expect Japan will contribute approximately 6 to 7 points to revenue growth. Excluding the Japan impact, revenue growth is consistent with our previous target of 10% plus.", "Consolidated operating margin next year on a GAAP basis is expected to decrease slightly due to the impact of the Japan acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect operating margin to be flat to up slightly in 2015. This operating margin forecast reflects the impact of consolidating 100% of the Japan revenue from most of 2015 versus the joint venture accounting approach in 2014, which recognized much lower revenue from Japan of picking up about 40% of the earnings.", "In our FY\u201915 targets last quarter, I mentioned 10% plus revenue growth and 15% to 20% EPS growth over 2014 non-GAAP EPS, which indicated that we would have solid operating margin expansion. The only significant change to that target is layering in the full impact of the Japan acquisition. We anticipate margin expansion will have returned in 2016, reflecting the full year impact of our 100% ownership Starbucks Japan and continued strong operating leverage.", "So we expect one year of slightly lower margin followed by return to consistent annual margin expansion, including the growth opportunities we see in Japan within our stores and other channels, including CPG.", "Regarding the CAP segment, we anticipate operating margin will be in the high-teens on a GAAP basis. This again reflects the change in ownership structure in Japan and the mix shift due to significant growth in China company owned stores. It also includes 2 to 3, 4 points of impact from the amortization of the intangible assets associated with the Japan acquisition. We expected this operating margin will move up into the low-20s over time. It is important to reiterate the both Japan and China have among the highest store level operating margins in our system. Also market level operating margins are expected to expand in both countries in 2015.", "We remain very confident in the decision to acquire all of Japan, given the immediate accretion of this transaction on a non-GAAP basis, low funding, cost leveraging, offshore cash, significant growth opportunities in our stores and other channels, and an overall high IRR, reflecting strong yield economics.", "In Americas, we expect operating margin to extend modestly from the excellent results posted in 2015, reflecting the ongoing investment and partners that Troy mentioned, offset by favorable sales leverage. In EMEA, we anticipate operating margin improving to 10% to 12% solidly into the double-digit range for the first time, driven by the benefit of mix shift as well as continued operating improvements across the region. And in channel development, sales leverage will provide modest operating margin expansion in fiscal 2015, improving upon our already outstanding operating results.", "Our strong revenue growth and margin expansion give us the confidence in earnings per share in the range of $3.42 to $3.54 in fiscal \u201915. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect EPS ranging from $3.08 to $3.13 towards the middle of our long-term range of 15% to 20%, an increase over our initial guidance provided in July.", "We are expecting GAAP EPS in Q1 in the range of $1.20 to $1.28 reflecting the large gain on the Starbucks Japan transaction. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.81 in the first quarter, a bit lower growth in the full year target given the investments in marketing as we approach the important holiday season and in our partners, primarily related to the recent leadership conference earlier this month.", "As we mentioned last quarter, commodities favorability added about 4 percentage points of EPS growth in 2014. And we continue to expect commodity costs to be roughly neutral in 2015. We have two-thirds of our coffee needs priced and despite the volatility in the coffee market, we do not expect coffee prices to impact our current EPS target for 2015.", "As to recent market prices, we\u2019ve seen nothing in current supply dynamics that indicates a fundamental market shortage, including origin-related concerns in Brazil. We have largely state out of the market year when coffee prices have spiked and we will continue to be patient as we walk in the final one-third of our needs in 2015.", "As a reminder, coffee only represents about 10% of our total costs and we have managed through difficult and volatile markets before. Also, we have never reduced our EPS target range due to the impacted coffee cost. We now expect to add approximately 1,650 net new stores globally. Of the 1,650, we expect 650 in the Americas, 150 in EMEA and 850 in China Asia Pacific.", "Our effective tax rate should be around 31%, including approximately four points of favorable impact in Q1 from the planned acquisition of Starbucks Japan. Finally, our expectation for capital expenditures is $1.4 billion for fiscal 2015. This is somewhat higher than prior years, primarily due to new store growth and the investments that will be needed as we launch Mobile Order and Pay, add more evening stores and make other important growth investments. We are confident that these investments will continue to feel the strong earnings growth that we have experienced over the past several years.", "In closing, fiscal 2014 represented another year of strong results for Starbucks. All of our reportable segments delivered record revenues and operating profits, with significant margin expansion for the total company. Record cash returned to the shareholders and new store economics at an all-time high reflect financial discipline and a keen focus on return on capital.", "As we enter the new fiscal year, our company remains position for growth, with specific investments and innovation digital capabilities and our partners. Funding this growth will come from operating efficiency and a renewed focus on better leveraging cost of good sold and overhead.", "Our financial targets for next year appropriately balanced the need to grow and invest with a financial discipline that leads to long-term earnings growth and margin expansion. We are confident that the best days for Starbucks still lie ahead as we look to capitalize on the strength of our global brand and the abandoned opportunities that remain in markets and channels around the world.", "With that, let me turn back the call back to operator to begin Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein", "Hi. Thank you very much. I was interested to hear Howard talk about some of the product innovation like the Chestnut Praline Latte. And I guess I was wondering if you could put that in the context of maybe the competitive environment, it feels like a lot of companies have tried to replicate what Starbucks is doing, whether it's Pumpkin Spice Latte or digital and loyalty. I know that what you're doing is distinct and different, but is it possible that competition has had something to do with a little bit of the deceleration that we've seen in the traffic? I ask only because some other parts of the restaurant industry have actually seen a little bit of improvement recently and so I'm just trying to sort of understand the divergence there? Thank you.", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you. We see no indication whatsoever from any competitive threat in any region in the country. Specifically, even in those markets where companies were giving away coffee for weeks at a time. We saw no dilution whatsoever in our customer base.", "With regard to product, it\u2019s clear that over the last 10 years, we created a category that did not exist with Pumpkin Spice Latte. Having said that, PSL did very well for the season. One of the hallmarks of Starbucks is surprising and delighting our customers with proprietary beverages.", "The interesting thing about the beverage we are introducing Chestnut Praline Latte, this is something we tested kind of under the radar last year. It surprised us at the high end and this is a product that\u2019s coming into the system with as much enthusiasm internally as things -- anything we\u2019ve done in the past during the holiday season and I put it in the same spirit as when we introduce Eggnog Latte many, many years ago. This is the beverage that\u2019s going to do very well. But the short answer to your question, no competitive attrition whatsoever to our business. We do not see it.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Hi. Great. Thanks. A follow-up on that, if we are to kind of isolate competition that's not have -- being an issue in the 1% traffic that I think even in Troy's remarks, he said, he was not satisfied or you are not satisfied with 1% traffic, what do you think it would have been, I mean, if we were to identify what issue of -- that led to that 1% being disappointing relative to your own expectations? And I\u2019d ask that in the context of, have you begun to hit a throughput wall maybe temporarily that can be at least partially solved through technology, is that an issue? And have you been able to isolate your own impact on comps through possible cannibalization as you have been recently taking up the store count, if it's not one of those two issues, what might it be? Thanks.", "John Culver", "Okay. I think, this is the central question of the day. So I really want to make sure we spend as much time as possible that everyone understands it and we\u2019re transparent as we possibly can.", "We do not have a throughput issue and Cliff will talk about that specifically. But a year ago today, we began talking about the macro shift in the amount of traffic that was going through malls and main streets in America.", "And as a result of what happened last year and that is less people shopping with bricks and mortar stores and much more people shopping online in their mobile devices, as I talked about in my remarks. We began dramatically transforming the holiday season in anticipation of another holiday season that would even be more - greater than last year in terms of attrition of people shopping in physical stores.", "What we did see though and we did not expect is that we saw it come earlier than last years holiday season. And so, we\u2019re ready to go in terms of the fall and holiday season based of what we have re-imagine and Starbucks for Life is going to be a big holiday product and we believe is going to create incrementality in our stores.", "But the short answer to the question is, there is nothing internal about what\u2019s going on within the Starbucks store in terms of throughput. There is nothing external in terms of competitive issues. This is a micro issue and we\u2019re addressing it with great a vengeance and as a result of that we are well-positioned.", "As I said in my remarks to not only we believe have a kind of holiday season that will demonstrate the change but heading into calendar \u201815 with mobile order and pay and all the things we are going to do in terms of technology and delivering the second half of the year we are going to be the company that is positioned to overcome and navigate through the macro change in the cultural shift of consumer behavior.", "So the net issue and this is so important, this is not a Starbucks issue. All the companies that you follow and all the retail companies that are reporting in other spaces are experiencing a downturn in traffic that is a result of a cultural macro shift that I spoke about in Q1 of last year.", "We\u2019re positioned and aggressive for holiday. We saw it a little earlier than we expected. But come holiday and Starbucks for Life and what we have done in the store to re-imagine what gift -- the gift of choice in term of card, we are well-positioned to take advantage of what we think the situation is all about. And Cliff just hit, specifically, the issue of throughput and productivity, so there is no misunderstanding.", "Cliff Burrows", "Yeah. Thank, John and thanks, Howard. In the quarter we\u2019ve just finished, we saw our strongest productivity numbers for the year and it was the greatest improvement on the previous year. The volumes we are putting through our stores at the moment are in excess of anything we have ever seen.", "I think the other thing that is significant, we opened in the final quarter over 200 stores in the U.S. and for the year 505 stores about half of them company-operated, half of them licensed. They are all performing at record levels and they continue to contribute significantly towards growth. So, it\u2019s all good, very positive about possibility and the potential to continue to grow.", "Troy Alstead", "I\u2019ll just add one point to that, John. Thanks, Cliff. We in the quarter are growing across all day parts, even the busiest morning day part is producing nice comp growth. So I think we are demonstrating increased throughput, as Cliff just said, highest productivity of fiscal \u201814 happened in the fourth quarter and it was a significant improvements over productivity in the fourth quarter of the prior year. It\u2019s not a throughput issue whatsoever and we continue to invest in the ability to move lines more quickly, put more volumes through our stores, digital with mobile order pay is just one example of what\u2019s yet to come.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "And if I'm still on, have you been able to isolate the impact, if any of cannibalization, you\u2019ve given that store growth that accelerated through the fourth quarter?", "Howard Schultz", "We are seeing nothing in terms of cannibalization. The quality of the new stores and I think our discipline around opening these new stores while maintaining our operational excellence and focus on the customer in the existing stores, we have never had so much success and strength in this area.", "Troy Alstead", "And John you heard Howard comment in is prepared remarks about convenience. We know the convenience is a huge, very important driver of the customer experience and ultimate size of the opportunity in the business.", "As we become increasingly disciplined around market mapping, around store location, around store formats, around performance of our dry fruits, about the ability to tap into new trade areas and demand like never before, as we are opening up accelerated numbers of new stores, basically opening them up almost at mature volume levels in year one, extremely high performance across all history, as we are able to do that, we are still performing with strong store results, strong comp growth and improve the untapped opportunity we have ahead for us in store growth in the U.S. and around the world.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "The next question is from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Hi. Good evening. We've seen Starbucks react several times in the last few years to patches of weakness with marketing pushes, sometimes in social media and it's worked. Is it safe to say that you might be teeing up corrective measures such as the ones you've done in the last few years?", "Howard Schultz", "David can you repeat the question, I am not clear exactly what you\u2019re asking.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets", "Back -- I remember back in the June quarter in 2012, the first quarter where you had a little bit of a soft patch and you did some stuff on social media? And in terms of discounts or incentives for people to come back and those measures worked then, you employed them later? I'm wondering if you had a soft patch late in this quarter, you've not had a chance to adjust and whether you might be thinking about making some pushes like that to help offset the bricks and mortar weakness you are talking about?", "Howard Schultz", "Yeah. David, thanks for the question. There is no doubt that the work that we\u2019ve done in preparing for holiday on the specific promotional overlay of Starbucks for Life is going to have a comprehensive and significant social and digital media component, leveraging all of the learnings we\u2019ve had in the past. And I think if you go back in history, we\u2019ve been able to leverage that and in doing so lower our cost of customer acquisition versus traditional media.", "And you are going to see that in spades, ones the holiday season kicks-off. Now, Starbucks for Life does not start until the first week in December but we\u2019ve got a tremendous offering between that. But you are going to see a lot of promotional material and I think based on the people we talk to and the demand that\u2019s already come from people who\u2019ve heard about Starbucks for Life. This has the potential to be quite a frenzy with regard to being, perhaps a number one gift that only 13 people in America and Canada are going to get.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "And the next question is from Keith Siegner with UBS.", "Keith Siegner - UBS", "", "Thank you. And congratulations on the record year. Scott, if I could ask you a question about the cost saves and efficiencies that you talked about clearly having an impact on the margins and good job on that. Could you talk a little bit about -- maybe put all of fiscal 2014 into a -- if you could quantify it maybe into some perspective. And then when we look at the guidance for fiscal 2015, how do the costs saves transition from this year to next year? In other words, what\u2019s built into the guidance on that front? Thanks.", "Scott Maw", "The first thing I\u2019ll say is I will be giving a significant more level of specificity in investor day including specific dollar amounts. But let me sort of frame it up what we are doing. If you look at cost of goods sold efficiencies, the challenge that we give our supply chain every year, last year, the number that we gave them was and I will give this in investor day with X.", "Next year, the number we\u2019re going to give them is two times of that. And so what we\u2019ve done over the course of two years is double the amount of savings that\u2019s going through the P&L. And that\u2019s what\u2019s in the forecast next year. And what\u2019s important to note is last year with that initial target, we drove no cost of goods sold leverage in the P&L. This year, particularly in the fourth quarter, for the first time, we turn that to cost of goods sold leverage and next year that leverage become significant. So we will walk through all of that in investor day, but that will give you some rough sense of the numbers.", "Keith Siegner - UBS", "Thanks.", "Operator", "", "The next question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America", "", "Hi. Thank you. Hey Howard, can I just clarify -- are you saying you are seeing this shift in retail that you noted last year starting earlier seasonally this year? Was that your observation?", "Howard Schultz", "Yes. Let me try and take a shot at that. If you remember last year, I spoke very specifically about the seismic change in consumer behaviors. And what I talk about specifically was a downturn in kind of traffic that we saw historically that I felt strongly was being displace be e-commerce and mobile shopping. As result of what happened last year, as soon as Christmas ended, we worked diligently to literally transform the entire Christmas holiday beginning in middle of November.", "In anticipation of another year of the downturn in traffic that could be worst in the year before. And the work that I\u2019ve outlined in terms of Starbucks for Life and all the plans we have around the 100 proprietary cards and leveraging the success we\u2019ve had with card in the last couple of years. Most specifically last year, we sold over $1 billion of cards. All of that is in place, beginning for the holiday season. What we saw though was that downturn in traffic which literally, I think when you think about back-to-school. If you talk about all the national retailers, back-to-school this year was almost a non-event for most retailers, physical retailers.", "And so once again, we saw the downturn in physical traffic. But we did not anticipate seeing it in the fall, we anticipated and we prepared for the holiday season that is what I\u2019m saying. This is not a throughput issue and this is definitely not a competitive space issue. This is a shift, a cultural shift in consumer behavior. I also want to just reiterate one thing. We strongly believe that the opportunity around convenience. Leveraging will be around drive-throughs and creating convenient opportunities for customers to get access to Starbucks is going to be another way and which we are going to win.", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America", "Okay. Thank you for that clarification. Can I ask one more? Just on the transaction of growth, the composition of the same-store sales mix, I think there's no question you are executing at all-time record levels. Traffic was still up. But is the challenge creating the opportunity for that incremental traffic growth? Are the speed-of-service productivity measures up year over year, but is that gap year-over0year starting to narrow that perhaps just makes it more difficult to drive transactions -- incremental transactions?", "Howard Schultz", "Yeah. Just to be clear and I think Howard said this. This is not a productivity issue. Productivity in the fourth quarter was stronger than all year long and significantly stronger than it was in the fourth quarter. The year ago productivity as measured by transaction per labor hour. Our ability to put more traffic through those busiest day parts. So that really isn\u2019t the issue.", "The broader issue is about less traffic out there for us to capture and bring in, as Howards just described this. Fundamentally, it\u2019s not a throughput issue whatsoever. And as we continue to drive in issue such as Mobile, Order and Pay and a larger percentage coming through the mobile app and payment technologies and whole digital experience, all that does is raise the lid on our ability to increase traffic for the stores and all day parts.", "Cliff Burrows", "I\u2019d just add to that that the -- when you look at the 42% of our stores are drive-through and offering tremendous convenience to our customers, we are seeing some of our strongest performance there. What we are anticipating in this coming year is the same step change and convenience that was offered in those stores to drive-through, is going to begin to happen through Mobile, Order and Pay. So the urban customer and the metro customer can begin to have that same convenience that people have shown by staying seated in their cars and quickly grabbing Starbucks on the go. We think it\u2019s a step change driver of our business.", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America", "Thank you. Appreciate the thought.", "Operator", "", "The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "", "Thanks very much. I'm wondering as you think about the role a check will play in the next couple of quarters, particularly as you start to anniversary the first big markets you've rolled food out. So can you talk about how those early markets are performing as they comp? Specifically, could check continue to grow in a year or two and by the same magnitude? And at the same token, I don't think this is the direction you're heading, but if you talk about if it's a change in the consumer, what role does increased value play in driving greater transaction counts, if any?", "Cliff Burrows", "", "Yes, John. Hi. It\u2019s Cliff here. With regard to food, obviously, we\u2019ve rolled out now the La Boulange platform to all of our stores. We\u2019ve got about 11,000 stores across the U.S. for company operated and license stores. And what we are seeing is all the learnings that we got from the early markets, we applied to more recent rollouts and we are seeing continued improvement in our operation around food, both on the sell side with another 2% contribution from food growth.", "We\u2019ve seen the learnings from bakery has really helped us, enhances strengthening our performance around breakfast sandwiches. We\u2019ve started to rollout lunch, which is the next important day part was around food. So we are seeing our ability, our operation ability around food and also we\u2019ve been able to refine and improve food, not only in the morning day part, we\u2019ve had a record breakfast sandwich yet and that\u2019s grown by about 30%, lunch has grown by 14%. And we\u2019ve only just started that, so year-on-year food is growing and is definitely helping check as is beverage mix as well. Howard, do you want to answer?", "Howard Schultz", "Yeah. And I would just add in terms of, Mobile, Order and Pay, our research and our design indicates that we look to see an improvement in ticket as well through the way we are designing that program as well. So it\u2019s not just traffic. It\u2019s not just throughput. It\u2019s not just convenience but we believe it will track. It will hit ticket as well", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Just to clarify, in year two, the stores that have had food for 14, 15, 16 months, they are still selling an incremental 2% traffic check growth over the year ago period.", "Howard Schultz", "Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t break it out as purely check. Some of it is growth of attach, but makes sure attach and mix -- yes, we are seeing that growth across the system.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar.", "R.J. Hottovy - Morningstar", "Thanks. Just had a question about the logistics around the delivery plants. First, if you've had any test markets that you've had the delivery plans in place, what kind of learnings you've had there? And then secondly, will these be facilitated out of existing stores or will some of these alternative footprint stores you've talked about play a part in that? Just any color on the delivery plans would be helpful?", "Matt Ryan", "Matt Ryan here. Its very early days at this but we are moving ahead, full speed ahead. The pilots are coming soon. We are going to be looking at a number of different options. There will probably be a multiple number of solutions that we go with them in terms of how we operationalize this. And at this point, we are not ready to tip our hand on that but suffice it to say we have lots of different ways of doing this in front of us and you can expect to see things in 2015.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays", "Great. Thank you very much. So question on the Americas -- on the operating margin. But -- it continues to push new highs, I think we are now in the mid-23% range. It was up close to 200 basis points this year. I know you mentioned we're going to go more modest improvement next year. Just wondering what you would attribute the greatest driver as perhaps where you think that could go without changes in the ownership towards more licensing.", "But that does kind of lead to my other connected question, which is just it looks like fiscal \u201815 is going to be over roughly half licensed in terms of new openings. I'm just wondering why we wouldn't consider pushing more heavily licensed or relicensing existing stores. I think you're at 40% today. But why wouldn't the U.S. or the Americas be at 60%, 70%-plus licensed just to kind of effectively push that margin even higher and take some of the onus off of you from an operational standpoint?", "Scott Maw", "It\u2019s Scott. I\u2019ll take the margin question in the U.S. I think the short answer is we think we can continue to grow operating margin in the U.S. business. If you look at the strength of the comp growth and the number of drivers we have lined up next year. And you look at how we\u2019ve been leveraging margin over the past couple of years through really all opened down the P&L store operating margin leverage, cost of goods sold leverage and G&A leverage. I think we can continue to drive more of that. I think we can continue to drive labor productivity as Troy talked about. So I don\u2019t see a limit to the operating margin growth. I think this year was an extraordinary year but I think we see it continue to expand in the future.", "Howard Schultz", "Jeff, let me speak to your last question. We generate unlike many others in company operated retail extremely strong return of capital as we deploy capital into company-operated stores. That\u2019s true all around the world. So our decision around when to license and when to company own are not surely driven by simply percentage margin because that\u2019s one thing. But we very significantly look at the overall size of the P&L, our ability to deploy capital and generate very, very strong return on capital, which we can do, the ability to use company-operated formats but in some case license operations to get access to geographies where we are not able to operate specific sites in real estate where we are able to operate ourselves.", "And so there is a wide range of board decisions that lead us to what we believe to be the awful mix of ownership, company operated and license in the U.S. and that\u2019s same analysis, sometimes a different answer to that same set of analytics lead us to think about license versus JD versus company operated all around the world. So we\u2019re very pleased with the direction we are going, both in terms of our company-operated development which will continue to accelerate and our license store development which will also continue to accelerate.", "Troy Alstead", "I think it\u2019s also good to say that there has been some exciting developments in recent years in license which traditionally was transport and grocery which continues to grow. But we\u2019ve also had the opportunity whether it is in Vegas, in hotels, in entertainment areas but more recently in Disney, which has just been incredible to offer Starbucks to a whole group of new customers in a captive space. And we see that continue to grow so we are pushing ahead on that as we push ahead on plans to expand our company-operated stores across the U.S., Canada and Brazil within the Americas.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Buckingham Research.", "Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research", "Thank you. I had a couple -- just one question on the modeling side and a clarification. I just want to understand when you said the 31% tax rate for 2015, is that a number that you are applying or using for both earnings numbers or is there a normalized tax rate associated with the 308 to 313? And then my question was with respect to the marketing. There was a quick reference in 1Q, and I think David asked also about that, pulling forward or your reaction to the 1% traffic. Are you going to spend more on marketing? Could you quantify for us maybe how much of a wait on 1Q's earnings -- that marketing, as well as the partner conference is going to have on your growth rate? Thank you.", "Howard Schultz", "Let me clarify the marketing issue. There is no additional marketing spend for this quarter than we previously had in our operating budget. We anticipated how big Starbucks for life could and would be. And we\u2019ve allocated marketing money against that that is in our AOP and in the guidance that we\u2019ve already shared with you. So there is no additional market expense beyond the normal course of business.", "Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research", "But additional for last year? Additional relative to last year though, it is. Correct? Because you didn't hold it out.", "Howard Schultz", "No. Actually its -- we are not going to get into specifics of how much we exactly spend on marketing but we are not spending -- I can tell you we are spending more on marketing for this holiday than we did last year. We\u2019re just reallocating the money against Starbucks for a while.", "Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research", "Okay, and then the partner conference?", "Howard Schultz", "Pretty even.", "Troy Alstead", "Well I\u2019d say we did not go for any specifics to that. We have a number of investments that Scott spoke about including the partner conference as we travel through this quarter that lead to the guidance with the initiative to the quarter and no specifics attached to any one of those items specifically.", "Scott Maw", "And then on the tax rate, if you think about the guidance I gave on 31% which included 4 points related to the Japan transaction and the difference between GAAP and non GAAP, Matt, is all due to the Japan transaction and so you get back into what the non GAAP rate is?", "Troy Alstead", "And if I can just wrap up one point on that, not related to tax but related to the previous thing. Things such as the leadership conference which we have conducted in year\u2019s past and conducted on just a couple week ago here in Seattle. Investments in our partner experience, those are critical investments that you should not view as cost or margin pressure.", "On the contrary, those have consistently in our business lead to a sustained growth in the partner experience and the partner\u2019s ability in our source to drive great customer experiences which is fundamentally what fuels the kind of comp growth in margin structure and volumes in Starbucks business that nobody else can replicate. These are investments in the current year and in the future that we are very proud of.", "", "Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research", "Right. I was just looking at within the prepared remarks, I think it was cited for 1Q's growth. I wasn't suggesting it; I thought it was cited in the prepared remarks that marketing and the partner were one of the reasons why the growth would be slower than the full year. Is there something else?", "Howard Schultz", "Understand. No, just a wide range of investments that we make in the business constantly, nothing more specific to provide there.", "Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question is from Andy Barish with Jefferies.", "Andy Barish - Jefferies", "Hey guys. I guess, I would like to just follow up on that on the two key investment areas for 2015 in terms of the partner pay and benefits and then digital. It does sound like those are very strategic step-ups, though. So I guess any help in terms of quantification in that regard would be useful?", "Scott Maw", "Yeah I think I mentioned those in my prepared remarks. I think the way to think about that is if you look at our long term EPS growth rate of 15% to 20%, we\u2019ve guided right in the middle of that. What\u2019s bringing us down a point or two of the top end of that is some of those investments. So we don\u2019t have the commodities favorability this year. And we are going a little bit more forward into some benefits around partner paying benefits and around digital. So that\u2019s what really brings us down from the upper end towards the middle. So we add all the things Troy referenced across the business together is a pointer to on the growth rate.", "Troy Alstead", "I\u2019ll jump in, Andy, on other question and then Adam can add. Starbucks for life is the main core element of holiday. However how many giftings and the loyalty program MSR, the opportunity to begin launching XOP Mobile Order and Pay in Oregon. And then our mobile payment in app, all of these things are skewed towards the recognition of the cultural ship we saw last year and what we strongly believe will put us in a position to win over a long period of time.", "And that is integrated into what Matt talked about earlier about taking a page out of our drive-through business which has been so strong and cracking the code on what the analog is of our urban stores and using Mobile Order and Pay and then the second half of the year delivery to accomplish that. And that -- these investments are going to pay off big time and we already know that Mobile Order and Pay is going to drive traffic in comp growth. Adam, you want to add anything about the specifies of that?", "Adam Brotman", "Yeah, what\u2019s important to call out is both with regard to the Starbucks for life card program this holiday as well as the launch of Mobile Order and Pay that we have the significance competitive advantage. We\u2019re not starting from scratch. We are rolling out Mobile Order and Pay. We are doing Starbucks For Life on the back of the leveraging already having built a world class mobile commerce and loyalty platform.", "So we have $12 million customers that are highly active on our mobile app $8 million active unless our loyalty members. One of the successful is not the most successful gift program in the world. We are integrating everyone of these programs, Card For Life, Mobile Order and Pay and eventually delivery right into that seamlessly. That\u2019s going to give us a huge competitive advantage going forward and give us the belief this is going to significantly drive throughput in incremental transactions.", "Howard Schultz", "Okay. Let me have the last word and just share with you that we are playing offence here. I mean, we understand that there is a macro issue in the consumership. We are playing offence and we began that last year right after holiday and come this holiday in calendar \u201815, we are going to be in a position to win. End of story. JoAnn, I think that\u2019s it.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "", "Thank you, Howard. Thank you all for joining us today and sticking with us a little bit longer this afternoon.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "Thank you. Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal 2015 results, which will be led by Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; and Scott Maw, CFO. Also joining us for Q&A are Troy Alstead, COO; Cliff Burrows, Group President, U.S., Americas and Teavana; John Culver, Group President, China, Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands; Adam Brotman, Chief Digital Officer; and Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer.", "This conference will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.", "Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.", "Please refer to our website, at investor.starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today\u2019s call with our corresponding GAAP measures.", "This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website at investor.starbucks.com.", "Before I turn the call over to Howard, please note that our Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which will be webcast will be held at 10 a.m. Pacific Time on Wednesday, March 18th here in Seattle.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Howard.", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. Starbucks performance in Q1 was exceptional by any standard or metric. Financially each of Starbucks\u2019 principal business segments and each of the regions around the world which we operate contributed meaningfully to record Q1 revenues of $4.8 billion, record Q1 operating income of $916 million and record Q1 EPS of $1.30 on a GAAP basis and record $0.80 when excluding non-routine items, principally the gain on our acquisition of Starbucks Japan.", "Operationally we delivered the best in-store holiday experience to customers in our history, bar none, with comp sales accelerating through the quarter and December\u2019s performance reflecting the success of our holiday lineup.", "For the quarter, we drove nearly 9 million more customer transactions through our U.S. stores than we did in Q1 last year, almost 12 million more globally and our global comp store sales grew 5%, with 2% coming from increased traffic, representing our 20th consecutive quarter of comp growth of 5% or greater.", "And every geographic region contribute to our performance this quarter with Americas delivering 5% comp growth, EMEA 4% and CAP 8%. These results are nothing short of stunning, particularly when you consider that our comps were calculated off of the U.S. store base of almost 7,000 stores and our global store base of almost 10,000 stores.", "Our Channel Development segment grew sales 10% and delivered strong profitability. At the same time, we increased our share of premium single serve, premium packaged coffee and premium packaged tea, and we delivered record non-GAAP operating margin across the company of 19.5% for the quarter, an 80 basis points increased over Q1 last year.", "I will be discussing a number of strategic initiatives and innovations that took shape in the quarter that will further extend our global coffee authority and leadership in retail and mobile technology and set us up to continue to lead and win around the world into the future, then I will turn the call over to Scott, who will take you through our Q1 financial and operating results in detail.", "I\u2019ll start with our re-imagined in-store holiday experience that integrated and leveraged food and beverage innovation with all of Starbucks digital, loyalty, card, mobile, store footprint and partner assets to deliver the most successful holiday in our 40 plus year history.", "Our new holiday seasonal beverage Chestnut Praline Latte was a huge hit with customers and one of our most successful LTOs ever. Our food platform driven by new and innovative holiday offerings, as well as our new lunch program continued to gain momentum during the quarter, contributing to incremental traffic and day part growth and our [Dot] [ph] Collection of premium, highly styled merchandise performed very well as well.", "But the really big news is how powerfully the innovation of our card wall and vastly expanded selection of proprietary Starbucks gift cards enabled customers to give a Starbucks gift of choice throughout the season.", "To put the success of our holiday card program into perspective consider these following metrics. This holiday, one in seven American adults received the Starbucks gift card, up from one in eight last year. Roughly 2.6 million Starbucks cards were activated on December 23rd alone and $1.6 billion was loaded on cards in U.S. and Canada in Q1, up 17% over last year.", "The strength and success of our Starbucks card program reflects both the power and the growing relevancy of the Starbucks brand is further demonstrated by the fact that over 31-day period more than 13 million customers entered into our first ever, it\u2019s a Wonderful Card sweepstakes, so the chance to win Starbucks for Life.", "Going forward, we know that increase Starbucks card sales drives My Starbucks Rewards membership and in turn traffic in our stores. We added almost 900,000 new MSR members in Q1 alone, bringing our total membership to over 9 million, 23% over above, where we were at this time last year and 5.5 million of our MSR members are gold members.", "We are already seeing and realizing the benefit of increased activity in our stores as gift cards received over holiday are redeemed and have additional enhancements to the MSR program planned and have confident will continue to result in even further acceleration in MSR membership in the future.", "It should be noted that MSR is one of the most important business drivers as new members contribute not only short-term increases in revenue and profit, but also long-term loyalty for years to come.", "We continue to see broad customer acceptance and adoption of our mobile payment technologies. Today in the U.S. alone over 13 million customers are actively using our mobile apps and we're now averaging over 7 million mobile transactions in our stores each week, representing roughly 16% of total tender, more than any other bricks and mortar retailer in the marketplace.", "In December we introduced Mobile Order and Pay into 150 stores in Portland, Oregon. The Starbucks Mobile Order and Pay experience is a proprietary, fully integrated technology that allows customers to order their food and beverage selections through their mobile device, ahead of time, go to their preferred store and pick up the completed order and pay automatically through the same mobile device that they ordered for.", "Mobile Order and Pay saves our customers time by enabling them to avoid the lines and waiting for the orders to be filled, resulting in shorter lines, faster service and improved in-store execution and an elevated Starbucks experience.", "Mobile Order and Pay has been extremely well-received by customers in the Portland market. We will be launching it now in over 600 stores in the Pacific Northwest in the months ahead and will be rolled out nationally later in calendar 2015.", "Our experience to-date confirms that once fully rolled out, Mobile Order and Pay will drive a significant increase in mobile payment transaction in our stores overall and have a flywheel positive effect on our overall business, driving both increased MSR membership and app usage and creating significant additional one-to-one marketing opportunities.", "As previously discussed, we are also preparing for the introduction of delivery in the second half of 2015 and are finalizing plans for two distinct delivery models. One of which utilizes our own people, Green Apron barista and the other which leverages the capabilities of a third-party service.", "We will have more to share with you on our plans for delivery in the months ahead, but rest assure that delivery like Mobile Order and Pay will drive incrementality and increased customer loyalty.", "Global leadership around all things coffee is and will always remain at our core, as we continue to innovate and invest to enhance and elevate the premium highly differentiated, but locally relevant coffee experience we deliver to our customers around the world.", "This month we successfully introduced Flat White, an espresso-forward handcrafted beverage that combines premium coffee quality with creative artistry to deliver a unique and elegantly delicious hot beverage. While it\u2019s very early in its early days for Flat White, we have already seeing great attachment for our customers and we are exceeding the early expectations.", "Many of you on the call today have the unique opportunity to experience the Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room first hand when you were in Seattle for our Investor Day, while I am delighted to report that the Roastery has received an overwhelming response from our customers and has been the strongest opening in the 40 plus history of our company, well exceeding even our most optimistic projections. The Roastery is setting new records every week, at the same time as it draws both repeat customers and visitors to Seattle at all hours of the day and evening.", "Personally I feel the Roastery is the finest, most creative and immersive experiential retail environment of any in the world today. There should be no coincidence that the Roastery opened in the same year that we identified and shared with you the urgent need for retailers to elevate, deepen and ultimately redefine how they were emotionally connecting with their customers.", "The Roastery represents both premiumization of the coffee experience and a new chapter for Starbucks. The additional small batch coffee roasting capacity provided by Roastery is enabling us to source, roast, blend and market spectacular limited available coffees around the world, elevate the coffee experience we deliver to our customers, and expand the availability of super-premium, micro-lot Starbucks Reserve Coffee to ultimately 1500 Starbucks locations.", "Customer response to Roastery has been so strong that in addition to the second Roastery, we have planned to open in Asia in calendar 2016. We are now actively looking at real estate in another major U.S. market as well. Roastery is also supporting the launch of our new Starbucks Reserve brand and the opening of 100 dedicated Starbucks Reserve stores over the years to come, devoted entirely to showcasing rare, limited premium small lot coffees as we continue to execute against our plan to elevate the consumer coffee experience globally.", "At the same time, we are continuing to invest in smaller alternatives store footprints that respond to the continued urbanization of retail. And we will soon be launching a pilot project around express locations in New York that will offer streamlined assortment of food and beverage offerings and integrate Starbuck\u2019s mobile payment and mobile order intake functionality in order to enhance customer convenience and provide even faster locations in these locations -- faster service in these locations.", "Turning to tea and Teavana. As we previously discussed, tea represents a massive, strategic opportunity for Starbucks around the world. And with the integration of Teavana complete, we are now executing our plan to double our key business to $2 billion over the next five years.", "We will accomplish this goal by further elevating the Teavana in-store experience, expanding into targeted select global markets with a focus on regions within our China and Asia-Pacific segment, entering multiple new channels of distribution for Teavana and further developing Teavana\u2019s e-commerce platform.", "We are already seeing lift in revenue generated by the sale of handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks retail stores driven in large part by the very strong customer response to the launch of Teavana branded Shaken Iced Tea and Teavana Tea Lattes. In this month, we launched Teavana Hot Brewed Teas in Starbuck stores in U.S. and Canada to extremely favorable early results. We will be sharing additional specifics around our plans for Teavana in the months ahead.", "Our fast-growing China Asia-Pacific region delivered strong sales profits in the company leading 8% store count in Q1 and continues to be a focal point of our future growth. As we shared with you at the Investor Day, we have plans in place to double our CAP store count to roughly 10,000 locations and triple our revenue to over $3 billion and our operating income to over $1 billion by 2019.", "China, our largest market outside United States, is a big part of our CAP story and we are well on our way to achieving our goal of having 3,400 stores in China by fiscal 2019. We now are present in 86 cities in China and we will be adding seven more cities in 2015. To give you a sense of the size of the China opportunity, last month we opened our 1,500 China store and now have over 320 stores in Shanghai alone, making Shanghai the city with the most Starbucks locations in the world today and we have plans to open many more.", "We expect to take full ownership of Starbucks Japan by the end of this quarter providing us with the opportunity to accelerate growth across all channels both in and out of our stores and ways not previously feasible.", "Our EMEA segment demonstrated continued progress against its transformation plan delivering comp growth of 4% with the key U.K. markets outpacing the EMEA regional overall. I\u2019m particularly delighted to share with you that the EMEA segment delivered its most profitable quarter in company history in Q1. Special recognition goes out to Chris Ainscough in all of our EMEA Starbucks partners for delivering these extraordinary results.", "Channel development. Our relationship with Keurig Green Mountain continues to strengthen at the same time as our K-Cup business continues to grow. Approximately 100 million Starbucks K-Cup were shipped in December 2014 alone, our largest single shipping month ever, up 20% over December 2013. Customers have now made Starbucks the number one coffee K-Cup in the category and we had another record share week during the key week before Christmas.", "Starbucks\u2019 already industry-leading share premium packaged roast and ground coffee continues to increase as well, together accelerating sales combined with strong operating leverage, enabled our channel development segment deliver 10% revenue growth and strong profit in Q1.", "Delivering the complete Starbucks\u2019 experience for our customers and creating an authentic emotional connection between our customers and our partner's has been and continues to be at the heart of everything we do. This month, we\u2019re making the single largest new investment we have ever made in our partner, our employee experience and it will touch 135,000 partners across our U.S. province.", "Changes include increases in barista and shift supervisor pay rates, enhanced recognition programs, a new food benefit, and updates to our dress code among others. At the same time, we are investing in technologies that will help our partners deliver a consistently elevated Starbucks experience for our customers, including introducing technologies to ease and simplify required store test, improving access to core business tools and resources and introducing partner apps with information and resources to facilitate viewing work schedules from a personal mobile device.", "We will continue to listen to our partners and we will endeavor to continue delivering enhancements to the partner experience that exceed their expectations. So they in turn will continue to exceed the expectations of our customers. And we are making similar investments in locally relevant ways to improve our partner experience elsewhere around the world as well.", "In closing, Starbucks is off to a fantastic start in fiscal 2015. Together our record-shattering holiday quarter, financial and operating results, new store opening in the Roastery and the undeniable success of our card mobile and digital strategies underscore the increasing strength of the Starbucks\u2019 brand around the world and ideally and uniquely positions us to thrive in the face of the seismic shift in consumer behavior that is underway.", "I cannot be more proud or appreciative of our partners and our teams around the world for delivering the record results we reported today. And I cannot be more optimistic about our future.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Scott Maw, who will take you through our Q1 financial and operating results in detail and I\u2019ll be back with Troy to share details on the transition. Thank you.", "Scott Maw", "Thanks Howard. Good afternoon everyone. Starbucks had a very strong start to fiscal 2015 with each of our reportable segments contributing to record consolidated revenues, operating income and earnings per share. Revenues grew to $4.8 billion, a 30% increase over the prior year, driven primarily by incremental revenues from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan, 5% global comp growth and incremental revenues from 1,641 net new Starbucks stores opened during the past four months.", "This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. As Howard mentioned, we saw global traffic increased 2% during the quarter, reflecting the strength of our brand and progress in many of the areas we discussed during Investor Day.", "On a GAAP basis, operating income grew 13% over Q1 to $916 million, resulting in operating margin of 19.1% for the quarter and earnings per share of a $1.30. When excluding non-GAAP items, operating income was $935 million or 18% higher than the prior year first quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.5% compared to 18.7% in Q1 FY\u201814 primarily due to sales leverage including meaningful cost leverage.", "After adjusting for certain items for comparability purposes, we also saw G&A leverage in Q1 as we continue to gain traction early in our efforts in both these areas. And non-GAAP EPS grew 16% to $0.80 per share over the prior year first quarter.", "Before going into specifics, I\u2019d like to provide a quick update on the status of the Starbucks Japan acquisition. During Q1, with the closing of the first tender offer, Starbucks assumed majority ownership of Starbucks Japan and a second tender offer to the public shareholders was commenced.", "We completed the second tender offer early in the fiscal second quarter and the transaction is expected to close as planned during the first half of calendar 2015. As of today, we own approximately 94% of the outstanding shares of Starbucks Japan. Therefore, our Q1 2015 financials reflect a consolidation of Starbucks Japan into our financials of the last eight weeks of the quarter and pre-acquisition JV accounting treatment for the first five weeks.", "I also want to explain our non-GAAP adjustments for comparison purposes. For Q1 2015, we have excluded several items related to our acquisition of Starbucks Japan, including an acquisition-related gain of $391 million that was partially offset by certain expenses related to the transaction.", "Combined, these items increased first quarter earnings by a net $0.41 per share. And for Q1 2014, we have excluded a litigation credit related to the Kraft arbitration. You can see the amounts, timing and description of these items in the detail reconciliation table provided at the end of the earnings release.", "In the Americas, the strong holiday season and excellent execution by our partners drove increases in revenue, operating income and operating margin to record first quarter levels. Revenue grew by nearly 10% in the first quarter, driven by 5% growth in comps and revenues from the 766 net new stores opened this past year.", "Americas delivered its 20th consecutive quarter of comp growth of 5% or greater. A notable 2% increase in transactions in Q1 was testament to the success of the traffic driving initiatives we discussed during our last earnings call and at our investor day. Increased operational focus helped drive transaction growth across all day parts, including strong growth at peak and accelerated during holiday.", "And for the fourth consecutive quarter, food contributed 2% to comp growth, including the excellent performance by our breakfast sandwiches with net sales growing 29% in Q1 versus the prior year and strong holiday limited time food offers. Sales of our lunch offerings increased 15% over the prior year, driven by our warm sandwiches, which included three new items year-over-year.", "Moving on to beverages, our core and limited time offerings contributed almost half of the U.S. comp growth during Q1. Holiday beverages delivered 9% year-over-year growth and total tea sales in our U.S. stores increased 17% over Q1 2014. The significant momentum gained from Teavana\u2019s handcrafted iced teas this summer continued in Q1.", "In addition to the solid revenue growth in Q1, operating income in the Americas grew 12% over the prior year to a new all time high of $818 million. Operating margin expanded by 50 basis points to 24.3%, a new Q1 record due primarily to sales leverage.", "Margin opportunity still exists in the established Americas business over the balance of the year, even when considering the additional investments in 2015 for our U.S. store partners. As you know, Target Corporation has made the decision to close all of their Canadian stores. We have a very good relationship with Target North America and our 132 Canada based licensed stores have been profitable and growing.", "However, given the impact on our operations and to the customer experience from Target\u2019s decisions, our stores will close tomorrow, January 23rd. We don\u2019t expect these closures to impact our guidance for 2015, nor will they be material to our Americas business results.", "Moving on to EMEA, with the momentum and remarkable results from fiscal 2014 continued into the first quarter, revenue grew by 3% after adjusting for $15 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact. Revenue growth was driven by 4% comps in the first quarter including 3% traffic. Among the most positive signs from EMEA is the record two-year comp of 9% was achieved in the first quarter.", "EMEA operating income in Q1 grew 49% over the prior year to $50 million, a new all time high. Operating margin expanded 510 basis points to 15%, as sales leverage and continued cost management, driven by the portfolio shift to higher-margin licensed stores and other operational improvements drove the segment\u2019s highest quarterly operating margin ever.", "We now expect EMEA operating margin to be at the high end of the 10% to 12% target range we gave to you last quarter. Momentum continues to build in EMEA, and we are very encouraged by the broad reach improvements in both our largest company-owned markets and our licensed stores. Across EMEA, Q1 licensed stores comps were in the high single-digits, with comps in the Middle East in the double digits.", "Turning to China Asia-Pacific, CAP revenues grew 86% over prior year in Q1 to $496 million, principally as a result of the Starbucks Japan acquisition. Revenue growth was also driven by 767 net new store openings over the last 12 months and strong comp growth of 8%, all of which resulted from increased traffic. China comps continue to trend higher than CAP comps as a whole.", "Adjusting out the net revenue increase of $172 million attributable to Starbucks Japan, CAP revenue grew over 20% for the 18th straight quarter. On a GAAP basis, CAP operating margin grew 34% to $108 million in Q1 and operating margin declined 860 basis points to 21.8%, driven by the impact of the ownership change for Starbucks Japan.", "Noteworthy is that under the previous joint venture ownership structure, our Japan margin was over 100% and our Japan store level margin remains among the highest in our global portfolio. The acquisition of Starbucks Japan was immediately accretive on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to believe that the CAP margin for 2015 will be in the high teens. Excluding the amortization of intangibles associated with the Japan acquisition, CAP operating income on a non-GAAP basis increased by 43% over Q1 last year.", "Operating margin excluding the full 1,060 basis point impact of our ownership changes in Starbucks Japan increased by 200 basis points, driven principally by strong sales leverage and a continuing emphasis on improving operations in the region. Strong performance from China's new stores and overall revenue and margin expansion contributed significantly to CAP\u2019s excellent performance in Q1.", "Starbucks China launched eight reserve stores in five cities during the quarter, including a world-class flagship store in Chengdu. Across the region, digital assets such as mobile apps, e-gifting Starbucks card and My Starbucks Reward continue to gain significant momentum.", "In channel development, Q1 was very strong as we gain market share in our U.S. business despite significant competitive pressure. Robust sales of K-Cups and healthy growth in packaged coffee drove revenues to a new quarterly record of $443 million in Q1 and 10% increase over the prior year.", "Operating income for channel development grew 33% in Q1 over the prior year to $158 million, another quarterly record. And operating margin was 35.6%, a 600 basis point increase over last year. Coffee cost capability and efficiencies in cost of goods sold were the primary drivers of this improvement.", "As we mentioned last quarter, we expect modest improvement from channel development margin for the full year compared to 2014, with commodities and cost favorability lower in the latter quarters of 2015. Starbucks K-cups gained the leadership position in the category in December with an 18% share during the last five weeks of Q1, our highest shares since launch.", "Overall, we shipped $232 million cups in Q1, 70% greater than last year, driven by strong customer response to new flavors such as cinnamon dolce and mocha and limited time offer such as Fall and Holiday Blend. A recently launched single origin K-Cups including Rwanda Rift Valley also contributed to growth, demonstrating customer demand for these excellent varieties.", "Starbucks packaged coffee also gained share during the last five weeks of Q1, growing to 28% and exceeding 30% for the first time during the key merchandise week of the month. Our cross channel loyalty program, Stars Down the Aisle, also played a role in these results with 1.7 million MSR members entering codes to grocery in Q1. Almost 12 million codes have been entered since the launch of the program less than two years ago.", "Teavana\u2019s performance, which is included in the All Other Segments, was relatively flat to the prior year. However, as Howard mentioned, sales of Teavana handcrafted beverages to our Starbucks stores in the America segments has driven exceptional growth in tea category revenue year-over-year.", "Regarding taxes, our Q1 tax rate was 24.2% and the decrease in the rate was primarily due to the impact of the gain related to the Starbucks Japan acquisition, which is almost entirely nontaxable.", "As I mentioned at the outset, Starbucks had a very strong Q1, with both solid revenue growth and margin expansion. This performance gives us the confidence in now targeting non-GAAP EPS of $3.09 to $3.13, thus moving the bottom end of our range up slightly from our previous target range while retaining the top end. A higher gain on the Japan transaction results in our raising the 2015 GAAP EPS target up to $3.53 to $3.58. Revenue growth is also expected to remain within our previous target range of 16% to 18%.", "Noteworthy is that, based upon where exchange rates are today, the stronger dollar will adversely impact revenue growth and operating income growth by about 1-point each. We are confident that we will be able to offset this foreign exchange impact, given the strength of our Q1 global operating results and the progress we will continue to make in leveraging constant G&A.", "It is also important to note that the vast majority of this currency impact represents only the effect of translating our foreign earnings into the U.S. dollar for reporting purposes. We actively hedge our largest Rio\u2019s economic cross currency cash flow risks.", "We are now expecting Q2 GAAP EPS in the range $0.63 to $0.64 and non-GAAP EPS in Q2 is expected to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.65. The second quarter is when the majority of our U.S. store partner investments begin in earnest, including our new food benefit and the changes in wages Howard mentioned earlier. This will have some impact on Q2 Americas margin.", "I also want to acknowledge that we see many external analysts' projections for Q2 EPS growth about 20%, higher than the Q2 earnings range I just mentioned. I suspect that this difference is driven by our increased partner investments in Q2 and some seasonality that we always see in our second quarter.", "I want to reiterate that our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP EPS growth remains the previously targeted 16% to 18%. We expect the first half of the year to be near the lower end of this range and the second half of the year to be closer to the upper end. Increasing revenues, strong global comp growth, new innovation, including Mobile Order and Pay, and the strong momentum we are seeing across our business gives us confidence in this slight acceleration despite additional foreign translation impact. In addition, we expect some acceleration in the benefit from our constant G&A leverage over the course of the year.", "Moving on to commodities, we have recently priced a significant amount of coffee, as prices have moved down within our target range over the past six weeks. As such, we now have 94% of our 2015 coffee needs priced, and therefore we expect commodity cost to be roughly flat to 2014. We will continue to provide updates, as we price our coffee needs for fiscal 2016.", "We continue to expect to add approximately 1650 net new stores globally. Of the 1650, we expect 650 in the Americas, 150 in EMEA and 850 in China, Asia Pacific. The outlook for our effective tax rate continues to be around 31%, and we expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2015.", "In closing, Q1 represented another quarter of excellent global growth for Starbucks by any metric. Our strong results in the quarter and confident outlook for the year reflect many of the critical strategic growth initiatives we outlined during Investor Day. We expect EPS growth to accelerate as we move into the back half of the year and coffee costs remain well under control, and our financial forecast includes an appropriate level of investment in our store partners and food, beverage and technology integration. We consider this as an investment and not as expense as it is integral to our continued growth in sales and profits over the long term. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year.", "With that, let me turn the call back over to Howard. Howard?", "Howard Schultz", "Scott, thank you very much. I have one more important announcement to share before moving on to Q&A. Today, I am extremely pleased to announce that Kevin Johnson, former CEO of Juniper Networks and former President of Microsoft\u2019s Platforms Division, and a 5-plus year Starbucks Board member will be joining the Starbucks senior leadership team as President and Chief Operating Officer effective March 1. Welcome Kevin.", "Kevin has worked closely with the Starbucks senior leadership team and me as a Board member since 2009 collaborating and providing deep insights and wise counsel in connection with our transformation in 2009. And many of the strategies we\u2019ve outlined at our Investor Conference last month and we will be executing against over the next several years. Kevin and I have been discussing his coming to the company in order to contribute his insights and expertise and help us as we grow our business in North America and around the world for some time. These discussions were independent of Troy\u2019s subsequent decision to take a sabbatical. Kevin will be reporting directly to me.", "Now as I said at our Investor Day and I want to underscore here, my passion and personal commitment to Starbucks has never been greater. I also want to make it clear that Kevin\u2019s addition is not part of some unannounced succession arrangement because it\u2019s not. Instead, Kevin\u2019s public company experience and his deep management, technology, global operating company supply chain, mobile and digital expertise will be a fantastic addition to already the strongest and most talented management team in our history.", "Please join me in congratulating Kevin, who is with us this afternoon, and welcoming him to Starbucks, and I would ask him to say a few words of introduction. Kevin?", "Kevin Johnson", "Thank you, Howard. Greetings, everyone. For nearly six years now, I have had the great privilege of working closely with Howard and the SLT and my role as Starbucks Board member. Through this involvement, I have gained the deep insight into Starbucks business, its values, the culture and the critical role that our 300,000 passionate partners play in delivering an elevated Starbucks experience to millions of customers around the world each and every day.", "In December I attended the Starbucks Investor Day, at which time we outlined our strategies for the next several years. We are fully committed to working with Howard, the SLT and our partners around the world to fully operationalize those strategies and to deliver results consistent with the expectations we share, our core values, and our culture. As always, performance driven through the lens of humanity.", "Troy and I are already engaged to ensure a smooth handoff as he begins to sabbatical on March 1. Our prior business experience leading global organizations combined with my Starbucks Board experience should enable me to quickly ramp up in my new role. I want our partners and shareholders to know the deep sense of responsibility and accountability I feel to fulfill our aspirations and deliver results. Howard?", "Howard Schultz", "Kevin, thank you so much. And on behalf of all of us today, this is a wonderful opportunity to welcome you to the Starbucks. This also marks Troy\u2019s last earnings call before he takes his sabbatical, a coffee break in Starbucks parlance. Troy has been a true friend, a great leader, and a passionate 23 years Starbucks partners, who is beloved inside our building and around the world. I am going to miss, Troy, in my daily conversations and collaborations and look forward to the day when he is ready to return to the company. Troy wants to say a few words to all of you in the financial community before taking his leave. Troy?", "Troy Alstead", "Thank you, Howard. I have had the incredible opportunity to be part of Starbucks for 23 years, starting from the early days as a small, privately-held coffee company with stores primarily just here in the Northwest. And while very difficult to step away from this place that I know and love so deeply, I recently made the personal decision to dedicate the next year to my family with four school age children. It gives me great comfort in stepping away right now as the incredible strength of the organization and momentum of the business.", "As we demonstrated during the Investor Day here in Seattle in early December, the performance of the business around the world is stronger than ever, the opportunities ahead of us are greater than ever, and the aspirations of the company are higher than ever before.", "The holiday quarter we just reported underscores that strength and opportunity. We are fortunate to have a leader of Kevin's caliber and experience able to join Starbucks at this time. I've worked with Kevin in his role as a Board member for many years and have benefited from his experience and insights. His experience as a public company CEO, combined with his years on the Starbucks Board, positioned him to hit the ground running.", "Kevin and I have already spent much time together in the transition and we\u2019ll engage further together over the next month to make sure everything transitions smoothly. Most of you on the call today I have come to know very well over the years. Thank you for your engagement and your support to Starbucks and of me. I assure you that the best days for Starbucks are still ahead.", "And finally, I'd like to say thank you to Howard for giving me incredible opportunities and support over many years and for supporting this personal family decision at this time. Thank you, Howard.", "With that, we'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Mike?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.", "Jeff Bernstein", "Great. Thank you very much. Congratulations, Troy. A question on the mobile payment platform, I know you\u2019ve got a lot of attention at the Analyst Day and it seems like that\u2019s probably the biggest opportunity from a traffic driving standpoint. It sounds like Portland must have gone reasonably well. It sounds like you\u2019ve identified the next few markets in the rollout by the end of fiscal '15.", "Just wondering whether you can give us some color on maybe early learnings over the past couple of months in terms of any challenges or nuances you\u2019ve had to overcome, or whether there\u2019s any insight into what kind of incremental sales, or how it helps speed of service? I saw there were some quotes from Scott earlier this afternoon in terms of the significant benefits that it provides. Just trying to get some insights in terms of your early learnings and what we can expect in the year so to come?", "Adam Brotman", "Hey, Jeff. This is Adam Brotman. I\u2019ll answer that. First of all, we\u2019re not breaking out specifics. But what I can tell you is we have completely hit the ground running in Portland and the experience for both our customers using the app as well as the partners operationally has met and even exceeded our expectations. So we are full steam ahead in terms of rolling this out around the country as you mentioned over the course of the rest of this calendar year.", "And what we\u2019ve learned is that this is absolutely every bit of what we thought would do in terms of helping us add convenience for our customers, integrate it fully and to not just our technologies, but our operational flow. And we are as confident as day we launched it that this is going to help drive incremental transactions, improve throughput and capacity, and even help us accelerate MSR.", "Jeff Bernstein", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass", "Thanks very much. Scott, you outlined $1 billion in cost savings over the next four years and there are several buckets. How much of that is in your thinking for '15 guidance? And specifically, you commented on through you\u2019re expecting a second half acceleration in earnings growth. Is that largely due to these cost savings coming in? Are you -- do you believe that there is like a sales benefit or an uptick in sales in the back half to drive that?", "Scott Maw", "Yeah. Thanks, John. Maybe I\u2019ll answer the back part of that first. There is a number of things as we look into the second half of the year that will help us accelerate profit. It includes cost of goods sold leverage, which I\u2019ll get you in a second, but also some of the work we\u2019ve done around.", "So for cost and then what we believe will be accelerated revenue opportunities through things like Mobile Order and Pay, some of the things we have around innovation with beverage and some of things we see in our international operation. So all of that is driving the slight acceleration in our earnings growth in the back half of the year, we are pretty confident we\u2019re going to see that.", "As far the COGS savings, we think it will be about $200 million this year. You may remember from Investor Day, in 2013 we had a $100 million that we booked, in 2014 it was $140 million, and in 2015 it\u2019s getting up close to $200 million. So, great work by the supply chain team and all the business units. And we\u2019re well on our way to recognizing most of that, most of that is already in the run rate.", "John Glass", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.", "Karen Holthouse", "Hi. Congratulations on the quarter and Troy on what comes next. Kind of a little bit of a deep dive question. If you look in the Americas segment, we\u2019ve now had a couple of quarters where licensed store revenue growth has been pretty meaningfully exceeding, unit growth plus comp growth. Is there something -- at the same time coffee prices are going down, so would you think that would be the opposite? Is there something in store composition or anything else in the model that we might be missing there?", "Cliff Burrows", "Karen, hi. It\u2019s Cliff. The significant difference is with our approach to food. And for the first time ever most of our licensees are now taking the incredible La Boulange range of food plus our breakfast sandwiches and that has allowed us to increase our revenue stream through our licensed stores. And it\u2019s been extremely well received. It also helps us improve our offers to the customers with a greater consistency than we\u2019ve ever had before. So food is the meaningful change.", "Scott Maw", "And I would just add to that. We are seeing comp growth in our licensed stores that equal to or greater than what we\u2019re seeing in our company-owned store. So it\u2019s the combination of those few things that\u2019s driving revenue.", "Karen Holthouse", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe", "Hi. Thank you. I wanted to just see about how much of a change there was in this enhanced partner experience and maybe what was driving that? And maybe what was driving that\u2019s just you are in a position of strength where you can just improve how you treat your employees and how you attract and retain the absolute best talent that was out there?", "But just wanted to understand a little bit more substantive, how their day-to-day or their year-to-year is going to be affected? And maybe if you were beginning to see some tick up in turnover or in execution consistency as the labor market for the better people is starting to get a little bit tighter?", "Howard Schultz", "Hi, John. This is Howard. You are probably, better than almost anyone on the company, you've covered the company since the IPO, you know first hand at the culture, values and guiding principles of our company are directly linked to the equity of the brand. And the equity of the brand is defined purely by the relationship we have with our customers, which is defined by our people.", "There is no issue of increased turnover or anything like that. We are in the business of doing everything we can, not only to invest in customer-facing experiences and enhancements but we have to do everything we can to do the same thing with our people. Starbucks has had a long history as you know of equity in the form of stock options healthcare now, college achievement in which we\u2019re providing free tuition for juniors and seniors.", "We want to do everything we can to demonstrate the amenity of the company and we have felt since day one that investing over the long term in our people is the best investment we can make in the customer experience. So we\u2019re taking these steps, not because we have a problem, we\u2019re taking these steps because it\u2019s the right thing to do.", "Operator", "The next question is from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore", "Thank you very much and my congratulations to both Kevin and to Troy on these new stages. Hi. I actually wanted to sort of ask about this transition. In the context of a couple of things, I mean, first of all sort of how Kevin\u2019s responsibilities might be similar to different from what Troy had in the sense that it sounds like Kevin has a lot of experience but not in retail or restaurants per se.", "And then I don\u2019t know if you can talk at all about this but obviously, Kevin has been a board member since 2009, so not really new to the story. But so I guess, is there any sense of what -- of may be what kind of initiatives he might undertake or where he might see the opportunities there?", "Howard Schultz", "Well, look this is Howard. I\u2019ll start it and I'll give Kevin his initial opportunity to share his own thoughts with you. If we were hiring someone from the outside who did not have almost six years of experience with the company, I think this would be a different story. The transition would be longer, the learning curve will be longer. But Kevin has lived and worked in Seattle for many years at Microsoft. So he has been a customer to Starbucks for many years.", "And as a board member, he has been the kind of board member that has been deeply involved in the strategies of the company and specifically aligning himself and helping the digital side of the transformation of the company which has been so successful with Adam. His responsibilities in many ways will mirror Troy\u2019s with the exception that he is picking up digital with Adam and he\u2019ll have IT as well as supply chain which Troy had. Scott Maw who had been reporting to Troy will be reporting to me.", "And Kevin will have the geographies, which are represented at this table with John and with Cliff. And I have spend many, many hours with Kevin over the many years sharing with him the aspirations we have with the company and he is very, very well versed. And what we are trying to do in the opportunity that lies ahead and we are very, very fortunate.", "In many ways, I said to a reporter a couple of hours ago having Troy leave the company is in no doubt a significant loss. But we are so fortunate at the same time, in a sense have a number one draft choice in Kevin Johnson. So Kevin, I\u2019ll give you your own opportunity.", "Kevin Johnson", "Yeah. Well, thanks for your question. I think, clearly my professional experience has been in the tech industry, companies like IBM and Microsoft and Juniper. But in that experience, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with many retail industry customers on technology-based solutions and ways to help them drive their business.", "Now certainly, as Howard mentioned, my experience on the Starbucks Board since 2009 is providing me a solid understanding of the strategy, and the culture and the leadership talent that we have here at Starbucks.", "And certainly Troy and I are working closely together on the transition just to ensure that this is a seamless moved transition. And in terms of what initiatives to undertake, I think the Starbucks Investor Day in December, we outlined strategy. And so my focus is going to be working with the SLT and working with our partners to operationalize that strategy. And that\u2019s going to be my priority.", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you Kevin.", "Sara Senatore", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Palmer with RBC.", "David Palmer", "Thanks. Congrats on the quarter and Troy, congrats on your career. Last year, Starbucks talked about a significant follow-up in result after Black Friday. How did the growth rate change through this last quarter and perhaps what did that tell you about your business? And then separately, Scott, with regard to your COGS commentary, dairy and energy prices, they come off lately, is that a factor in the back half? Thanks.", "Troy Alstead", "David, I\u2019ll take the holiday question and then give it to Scott. You are exactly right. I think we were here at last year at this time. And I think I said for the first time that the U.S. retail environment and the consumer, we are in -- we are experiencing a seismic change in consumer behavior. And as a result of that brick-and-mortar retailers will have to redefine their relevance.", "We went to work at this time last year in completely redefining and transforming not only our holiday season, but in many ways the calendar year at \u201815 with leveraging all the assets we have and specifically understanding how we could utilize MSR, our digital platform to lower our cost of customer acquisition and emotionally build a relationship with them that was not only based on than being in our stores for driving traffic in our stores.", "And so the results that we posted today is a manifestation of all that and specifically the merchandise relationship that we built around the Dot Collection, the Starbucks card and we got very fortunate in once again hitting a bull\u2019s eye with Chestnut Praline Latte. And we may have another winner of that magnitude with Flat White, don\u2019t know yet. But clearly the beverage resonated with our customers.", "And we were going to position like and unlike many other retailers who demonstrate such relevancy in store with a beverage that created demand and experience that was spot on in terms of the card and the gifts of choice, and Starbucks for Life just added all of that in terms of the excitement. And I would just add that our people were so proud of how we went to market for holiday and they rose to the challenge and were able to really develop that kind of relation with our customers.", "Serving millions of customers more than we did last year, we should not underscore. We are talking about 9 million more customers. It\u2019s an unbelievable number and that was U.S. alone, and we saw the same level of accretion worldwide with 12 million more customers. It\u2019s a stunning number in any environment, especially when you consider the environment we are in with a different type of consumer who is really turning away from traditional and bricks-and-mortar retailers. Scott?", "Scott Maw", "On the commodity piece, the way that it shapes up for the year, David, is we saw some significant coffee favorability in the first quarter, not much on dairy and diesel. And you can see that coffee favorability in the channel development margin improvement. That coffee favorability at that level is not going to continue in the back half of the year and so you\u2019ll see channels margin growth come down. However, we do see offsetting that some favorability in dairy and diesel. So when you add that all the way, all up across the year, we think commodities will be roughly neutral year-over-year. But that\u2019s kind of how it shapes up.", "David Palmer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Keith Siegner with UBS.", "Keith Siegner", "Thank you. And similar congratulation to you everyone involved. I just want to circle back and ask one more question on the [indiscernible] or the mobile order and payment since it\u2019s such an exiting part of the story for this year. Scott, maybe you can help me think about this. When we think about that pace of rollout and we know kind of what the completion date is, but how does the pace of the rollout happen? Is it a slow build and we get a big boost right at the end? And then similarly how did the costs associated with this roll? Did they come a little early? Maybe is that part of what leads to some of the cadence of the year -- if you could help me with those two pieces, it would be very helpful? Thanks.", "Howard Schultz", "Adam, why don\u2019t you start and then Scott could jump in.", "Adam Brotman", "Okay. Keith. In terms of the rollout pace, it\u2019s going to be fairly evenly spread out throughout the year. So it\u2019s neither front loaded, nor back loaded and so that\u2019s how we are thinking about it. And so far everything seems on track to that.", "Scott Maw", "And as far as the cost goes because of the rollout, the cost is pretty evenly spread as well. And I\u2019ll just remind you, there is not a lot of cost. There is some incremental costs that will happen this year, but because of how integrated this is with our existing technology and how seamlessly it works with our existing system that cost is manageable.", "Howard Schultz", "Can I do one thing, also? There is lots of companies who are ringing the bell about mobile order and pay. But in my prepared remarks, I specifically talked bout this is a proprietary integrated relationship that we are building with our infrastructure and in turn with the customer. Adam, can you just -- you or Matt can just touch on that for one minute?", "Matt Ryan", "Well, yeah. And this is -- and actually at the investor day, but this is -- what's so unique of what we are doing is we are not starting from a cold start. We already have 13 million active mobile users. We have the POS and payment capability. We have MSR now up to 9 million plus. And so for us, we are simply adding on mobile ordering on to that stack of proprietary integrated technology that allow us to do something like that. And it sets us up frankly for delivery as well. So the kind of pace of innovation, our ability to roll it out and positively influence our business overall is because we have built this and integrated in the way I just mentioned it.", "Howard Schultz", "And then the other thing I just want to say one more time is that in a traditional advertising and marketing to try and overcome this seismic shift in consumer behavior is probably not going to work for most people. The relationship that we have build with our customers though mobile payment through MSR, through gold members and now Mobile Order & Pay and delivery is a significant driver in not only elevating the relation that we have with our customers, but significantly lowering our traditional cost of customer acquisition, especially when you compare it to other national retailers.", "Keith Siegner", "Thank you much.", "Operator", "Next question is from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino", "Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations again to everyone. My question is a follow-up on the Mobile Order & Pay experience you've seen so far in Portland. And really, I wanted to focus on the operation side of this. And I know, there was some potential, I guess changes in how the back of the house or the baristas operate and some potential conflicts with how customer timing and pickup might work. So, I was wondering if you could comment on your experience so far and if your operations are running as smoothly as you would have envisioned at this stage of the game?", "Cliff Burrows", "David, it is Cliff here. It\u2019s been incredibly smooth. We did a lot of work upfront. As Adam already said, we built off existing platforms. We integrated it with MSR. It is totally intuitive and we took the existing flow in the store, have build a printer into the register lineup and so it is an absolutely seamless experience for our baristas. And it doesn\u2019t change the routine for the bar, as consolidation area for our food and beverage come together and quite frankly, I say without fear of contradiction from any of my colleagues here. It has been seamless and we are delighted by the way the customers from day one, when we are down in the market and our partners have embraced this and that\u2019s why we are still confident we can meet this 2015 rollout.", "David Tarantino", "And I guess one quick follow-up. Have you run into issues with the timing of the order being prepared and the timing of the customer picking it up, is that, I know that was one potential watch out, but is there any issues like that that you are still working through or is it working pretty smoothly?", "Howard Schultz", "No. We have had, David, incredible smoothness in this. There are obviously individuals who will learn it, it\u2019s a new technology. We didn\u2019t go in with a narrow test or pilot. We went in replicating our final rollout plans. We are learning along the way, but it has been -- it's improved everyday, adoption has grown from day one and we are extremely confident about this.", "David Tarantino", "Great. That sounds great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "The next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Buckingham Research.", "Matt DiFrisco", "Thank you. I just had a follow-up and then a question. I just wanted to understand, you made a comment, Scott, regarding the investment in your partners and how that's going to be a little bit more or comes into 2Q and that's somewhat of the 16% or lower end of the full year guidance in 2Q and then the somewhat ramp in the back half? I'm just curious, isn't that though like wages, so I don't know why is there like a level of investment that is going on in 2Q or a conference of sorts or one-time training or something that\u2019s weighted in 2Q, if you could give some color on that?", "And then my question was with respect to Portland and the digital. I'm curious on if you have had an early read in the first six weeks or so of the rollout or four weeks of the rollout? What you are seeing in winning over more people, has Portland outpaced bringing people into the mobile app versus other regions, obviously, everyone is moving over, but are they moving over faster because of the added benefit of Mobile Order and Pay? Thank you.", "Scott Maw", "Well, I\u2019ll go first and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Adam. Matt, what I was referring to was if you look at analyst estimates for the second quarter, they are north of 20% on average. And I was trying to speak to what might be missing in those forecasts. And I think, this investment that starting really in January and you\u2019re right, continuing all year in our forecasts and partner wages and other benefits might be an explanation for that difference between what we\u2019re seeing and what you\u2019re seeing.", "What\u2019s really driving the second half acceleration in earnings, by the way, it\u2019s a pretty slight acceleration from 16% to 18% is all the things that we\u2019ve talked about on the topline, the momentum we see in the business and then the things we\u2019re doing in the middle of the P&L book within the stores and within the supply chain and support cost, we see that picking up a little bit in the back half of the year. Adam?", "Adam Brotman", "And again we\u2019re not like -- I can\u2019t get into specifics, the answer is yes. We are seeing incremental driving of MSR membership, usage of our app. And what\u2019s so exciting about that is we have -- this is still in beta mode in terms of -- we haven\u2019t even put this on our android platform yet, which is coming soon. We have additional features to come. So we\u2019re just getting started and we like what we see early on in terms of all the drivers that we talked about at the Analyst Conference.", "Scott Maw", "And Matt, while I\u2019m clarifying some comments that I made earlier, I want to make sure everyone\u2019s clear that target stores that we\u2019re closing in Canada are licensed stores. And then I want to make sure the amount of non-GAAP EPS relate to the Japan transaction is $0.49, I may have said $0.41, so clean all that.", "Matt DiFrisco", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar.", "R.J. Hottovy", "Thanks. I had a question about lowering the cost of customer acquisition, specifically the success of the holiday promotions, like Starbucks for Life and other things you are running during the period? Just wanted to get a sense of how you plan to keep this momentum going and other activities, promotional activities that you might have planned for the rest of fiscal 2015? Thanks.", "Matt Ryan", "Matt Ryan here. The reason why customer acquisition will continue to come down in terms of cost is a confluence of a number of factors. As we add more features that are meaningful to the customer, things like Mobile Order and Pay, down the road delivery, we\u2019re going to be giving the customer added reason to sign up for MSR, that is an organic thing that happens.", "The second thing that happens is as we sell more and more gift cards, we naturally get through the process of registration incremental MSR customers. Those are probably the two most important things we see rolling out. And that along with increased focus within our stores, which is a low-cost customer acquisition opportunity, builds out MSR as a platform and the acceleration in MSR growth we saw last quarter was the result of all three of those things.", "R.J. Hottovy", "Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question is from Nick Setyan with Wedbush.", "Nick Setyan", "Thank you. Congrats again on the great quarter. My question is on the China Asia Pacific, we saw a very meaningful acceleration from last quarter, both on a one and three-year basis, and maybe -- there\u2019s a lot of folks on the U.S. comp drivers, maybe you can -- maybe give us some color on the various drivers in China Asia Pacific and whether it's market-by-market or one product or another, that would be great? Thank you.", "John Culver", "Yeah. Nick, this is John. Thanks for the question. I think, really we saw obviously 8% comp growth in the quarter and it was all driven by traffic and what I would say is that, we have more customers now coming in our stores than ever before in our history, across the 15 markets that we operate in, that is being driven in large part as well in China.", "And when you look at the China comp and I'm not going to quote any specific number, but China comp actually outpaced the entire region. We opened our 1,500 store there, we opened eight new reserve stores there and the relevance of the brand in China has never been stronger.", "We did a consumer study in China and what we have seen is that, we are looked at as the coffee leader in the market. That our products, the localization of our products are locally relevant and we are building a strong trust between our baristas, as well as work with our customers.", "And what we have been able to do is we have been able to take the awareness that we built around Starbucks in China, as well as in other markets, we have been able to translate that into traffic into our stores and we have done a very good job of converting that awareness to actual visits.", "We had a very strong holiday season, our promotional beverages did very well and we feel that we are in a position to continue the momentum. When you look at our two-year comp across the region, it\u2019s at about 15% and Starbucks card and mobile does very well in China. We are at now over 40% of our transactions are done on the Starbucks card in China, as well as two other major markets.", "Japan had a very strong quarter as well, given the tough economic environment that\u2019s going on in Japan. The acquisition, as Scott said, was accretive in the quarter and we are in a good position in Japan to accelerate the growth through new stores, through channels outside of our stores, as well as aggressively going after the digital platform in Japan as well. So feel very good about the job our team is doing across the region.", "Howard Schultz", "John, thank you.", "Nick Setyan", "Thank you.", "Howard Schultz", "Last question.", "Operator", "We will take one last question. The last question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe", "Follow up.", "Howard Schultz", "John, you don\u2019t get two questions. Go ahead. Kidding.", "John Ivankoe", "I know a lot of people will probably ask this, so I will just take the opportunity to ask it publicly. It\u2019s sounds like December was the high month of the quarter, if I am listening to your comments the right way and I think in your prepared remarks you made some comments that you already seeing and realizing the benefit of increased activity in the stores, which I assume is January? So should I interpret the right way or are you saying that, there was further acceleration in January relative to December? Just trying to get a sense of what you are trying to communicate regarding March in general year-over-year and relative to the first quarter, if I can ask that?", "Scott Maw", "Yeah. Thanks, John. It\u2019s Scott. We haven\u2019t said anything about January. You are correct that within the quarter we did see some acceleration and as the holiday period our busiest period, we actually saw the highest transaction comps we have in the U.S. and that is certainly encouraging as it relates to the first quarter.", "John Ivankoe", "Okay. Thanks.", "Howard Schultz", "Thanks, Scott.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "This concludes Starbucks Q1 fiscal 2015 earnings conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "Thank you. Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company.

Howard?", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today\u2019s call. Q2 of fiscal 2015 was a stunning quarter for Starbucks on almost every level. Record Q2 revenues of $4.6 billion, record Q2 operating income of $778 million and record split adjusted Q2 EPS of $0.33 per share, all clearly demonstrated a continuation of the strength, momentum and robustness we saw in our business during holiday Q1. Equally impressive is that Q2 results were delivered despite foreign exchange headwinds and soft consumer environments in several key markets. ", "Our global comp store sales increased a strong 7% in Q2 with 3% coming from increased traffic, our 21st consecutive quarter of comp sales growth of 5% or greater and a spectacular result given that our comps are now calculated off of the US store base of over 7000 stores and a global store base of over 10,000 stores. No other global retailer approaching our size or store base comes remotely close to posting such consistently strong comp performance. ", "Our Americas segment delivered another outstanding quarter with performance driven by the successful introduction of several innovative new coffee beverages, including Starbucks Flat White, our new tiramisu and caramel flan beverage, an expanded selection of Teavana branded tea beverages and very positive customer response to our new breakfast sandwich lineup, all of which contributed to increased food attach across virtually all regions and day parts. ", "Turning to China and Asia Pacific. Now with over 5000 stores, our China Asia-Pacific segment delivered a company leading 12% comp increase in Q2, almost entirely coming from increased traffic and a strong increase in operating income as well. ", "We also completed the acquisition of Starbucks Japan in Q2 and are in a position to aggressively go after business across all channels in Japan both in and outside of our stores in ways never before possible. And we are already seeing an acceleration of our business in that key highly opportunistic market. ", "CAP remains a focal point of our future growth and we are on track to meet our goal of doubling our CAP store count to roughly 10,000 locations tripling our revenue to over $3 billion and tripling our operating income over $1 million over the next five years. In addition, I am proud to say that EMEA delivered the strongest Q2 performance in its history, reporting both record operating margins and record operating income. ", "Our channel development segment also delivered a banner quarter with a 16% increase in sales and strong increases in both operating margin and operating income while at the same time further increasing Starbucks\u2019 already industry-leading share of premium single serve, premium packaged coffee and premium packaged tea. Starbucks by a wide margin is the number one premium coffee brand in the K-Cup category and we now have shipped over 2.5 million K-Cup packs since launch. ", "Starbucks\u2019 stellar performance in Q2 was multi-segment, multichannel and multi-geographical, driven by our people in distinct markets all of the world, yet woven together by a common thread, industry-leading partner-centric and customer facing innovation and the ongoing strength and global relevancy of the Starbucks brand and retail experience. Our history and experience demonstrate and our research unequivocally confirms that the investments we make in deepening our connection to our people links directly back to value creation for our shareholders. By offering every eligible partner the ability to profit alongside our shareholders through big [ph, stock providing pay healthcare coverage, providing contended [ph] wages and incentive compensation opportunities, reimbursing college tuition costs through Starbucks college achievement plan, sharing and advancing our common values and investing in the communities in which our people live and work, we are and will continue to make significant investments in our people around the world. And these investments are bearing fruit for our shareholders. You will hear more about that and about our additional partner investments that we're making in a few moments. ", "On today\u2019s call I am going to provide you with an overview of some of the innovations and strategic initiatives that we announced or that we begin to shape in the quarter. Innovations and initiatives that will enable us to further extend Starbucks global coffee authority and leadership around all things retail and mobile and position us to continue to lead and to win around the world into the future. ", "And I will turn the call over to Kevin who will share highlights of individual segment and market performance in Q2 and finally Scott will take you through our Q2 financial and operating results and we\u2019ll finish up with Q&A.", "Leadership around all things coffee remains at our core and we continue to innovate and invest in order to meaningfully elevate the premium highly differentiated locally relevant coffee experience we deliver to over 75 million customers from over 22,000 stores in 66 countries around the world each week. ", "Starbucks Flat White, an espresso-forward handcrafted beverage that combines premium espresso quality with creative artistry to a delicious hot beverage that we introduced into the Americas segment early in Q2 has already generated the strong customer following and is driving a food attach exceeding our original expectations. On the heels of the success of Flat White, we also introduced both Starbucks Cold Brew and in certain markets yogurt-based fruit smoothies incorporating and leveraging branded Evolution Fresh juices. While in the early days, each of these beverages is receiving a highly favorable customer response and we will be rolling out a fantastic line-up of innovative new Frappuccino beverages and granted branded Teavana iced teas for our customers during the hot summer months ahead.", "You may recall that in our holiday Q1 we recorded record setting card sales and loads of $1.6 billion that we expected to drive traffic and positively impact our business in Q2 and that is precisely what occurred. More important is that we are now seeing large numbers of last holiday\u2019s first time gift receivers become loyal, engaged, repeat Starbucks customers, supporting and contributing to the growth we\u2019re seeing across our global customer base. And with the increasing customer acceptance of our mobile app, we now have over 16 million active users. ", "Dollars loaded on Starbucks card continues to rise. This is a really important number, at 19% year-over-year increase in Q2 alone in which $1.1 billion in Q2 was loaded, a trend and a figure that bodes very well for our business in coming quarters. ", "We know that increased Starbucks card sales drives increased My Starbucks Rewards membership and in turn increased traffic and sales in our stores. We added 1.3 million new My Starbucks Rewards members alone in Q2. More additional members in one quarter than most loyalty programs have in total and now have over 10 million active members with almost $6 million members being active Gold members. My Starbucks Rewards will continue to be among our most important business drivers as new members contribute not only to short term increases in revenue and profit but also to long term loyalty for many years to come. ", "In December, we introduced Mobile Order & Pay to our 150 stores in Portland, Oregon. Since then we\u2019ve expanded mobile order and pay to over 600 stores in the Pacific Northwest and we are now on track to roll out mobile order and pay nationwide this calendar year. Mobile order and pay has been extremely well received by our customers enabling them to order ahead, avoid lines, avoid waiting for orders to be filled resulting in shorter lines, faster service, improved more efficient in-store operations and execution and an elevated Starbucks experience, and mobile order and pay is driving incrementality as we\u2019re seeing an increase in both attach and daily transactions in those stores and markets where mobile order and pay has been launched. ", "In addition, as we shared with you before, we are on plan to launch delivery in Seattle and in the Empire State building in New York City during the second half of 2015. There is no doubt in our mind that delivery like mobile order and pay would drive further incrementality and profitability for the company. ", "Many of you have the opportunity to experience the world's most premium coffee experience for yourselves when you were in Seattle for our investor day last December and visited the one-of-a-kind 15,000 square foot Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, what many have called the Willy Wonka of coffee. We fully anticipated that the Roastery would be a success and that we would build additional roasteries in select US and international cities in the years ahead. But no one could have recently have anticipated the overwhelming customer and visitor response that roaster is generating in only the first four months of its operations. Look for our second Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in calendar 2016 and the city to be announced later this year. ", "And while the roastery is an immersive, experiential venue, it\u2019s actually so much more. Our intent with the roastery from day one was to create and build a new ultra-premium coffee brand and business unit. The additional small batch coffee roasting capacity provided by the roasteries enabling us to source roast blend and market spectacular limited availability, microlot coffees from around the world and to meaningfully elevate the super-premium coffee experience we deliver to our customers. We are already expanding availability of Starbucks reserve coffees to over 1000 Starbucks locations as we begin to build the Starbucks reserve brand. ", "And the roastery is enabling the launch of 500 Starbucks reserve stores worldwide, a new class of stores that will showcase the most premium of all superpremium coffees in the world and the newest coffee brewing methods such as pour-over side and Starbucks proprietary brewing technology Clover. Starbucks reserve stores will also incorporate an integrated Teavana kiosk to leverage traffic and growing consumer interest in super-premium loose leaf and packaged Teavana teas. Starbucks reserve stores and Starbucks reserve brand provide us with an exciting innovative highly differentiated new global growth opportunity that leverages all of Starbucks\u2019 strengths around the world in terms of coffee sourcing and roasting, premiumization, coffee beverage development, retail site selection and design, merchandising and customer digital. [indiscernible] with the opening of our new Starbucks reserve selection store towards the end of calendar 2015 and the opening of Starbucks reserve coffee bars within select existing Starbucks locations across the US as part of normal Starbucks store renovation cycles. ", "The addition of Starbucks reserve coffee bars will both drive incrementality in existing Starbucks stores and quickly build consumer awareness of our new Starbucks reserve brand domestically and around the world. ", "In closing, before I turn the call over to Kevin, I want to share with you what many within Starbucks and I already knew that Kevin Johnson is a passionate servant leader, a world-class businessman and expansive thinker and a wise counsel. The partnership and insights that Kevin brings to the senior management leadership team as a highly engaged six-year member in the Starbucks Board of Directors and now as President and COO of our company, are providing to be invaluable and are already having a tremendous positive impact across all business segments and regions [ph] and he\u2019s just getting started. So I welcome Kevin to the call and I now turn the call over to Kevin. ", "Kevin Johnson", "Thank you, Howard and good afternoon everyone. Q2 was an excellent quarter for Starbucks across the board. Before providing operating highlights for each of our segments, I thought I would share a very brief update on my transition into day to day management. ", "Since January, I have been working closely with Howard and Starbucks senior leadership team to ensure a smooth transition and ramp up beginning on March 1. I am now almost four months into a deep immersion across all key business functions as well as deal business to stores and facilities throughout North America and Europe, engaging with our partners, customers and suppliers. Next week my immersion takes me to Asia where I will have the opportunity to visit Starbucks stores and partners in the region with our group president, John Culver. ", "This immersion process is providing me with a more comprehensive understanding of Starbucks business and operations. But more than that, the immersion is providing with an even greater appreciation of the enormous global opportunity that lies ahead with this fantastic company and the remarkably talented management team. I am committed to doing everything I can to create value for our Starbucks partners and shareholders, always through the lens of humanity around the world and into the future. ", "Thanks to Howard and all the Starbucks partners for their warm welcome, for their help in making my transition into this role so seamless. ", "Now I would like to tell you about Q2. Our Americas business continued to deliver strong consistent profitable growth, with the 7% increase in comp sales in Q2 and record revenue up 11% over last year, record operating margin and record operating income. ", "Our US food program continues to be a key focus and the tremendous opportunity for us. I am pleased to report that in Q2 US food sales grew 16% year on year and contributed 2 points of comp growth with every day-part platform and region contributing to the increase. Noteworthy is that the sales of our innovative new breakfast sandwich which has contributed to a 35% year over year growth in our breakfast sandwich program. Our lunch platform also delivered double digit year over year gains as well. ", "As Howard mentioned, we introduced the Starbucks Flat White beverage that was enthusiastically embraced by our customers. Flat White held elevated the entire core espresso category and drove food attach. We launched another coffee forward beverage, Starbucks Cold Brew in select North American markets with the plan to offer Starbucks Cold Brew in many more US stores this summer. While still early in this innings, customer response to Starbucks Cold Brew has been very strong. ", "Hand-crafted branded Teavana tea beverages sold in Starbucks retail stores continued to drive both food attach and strong growth in the tea category in Q2 with tea revenue up 15% year on year, driven in large part by a very strong customer response to the launch of Teavana branded Shaken Iced Teas and Teavana Tea Lattes. Teavana represents a very compelling strategic opportunity for Starbucks and we plan to expand availability of the branded Teavana tea beverages throughout Starbucks retail stores in multiple new geographic markets in the quarters ahead. ", "Based on our success in the United States with La Boulange bakery platform we\u2019ve now begun to point it to throughout Canada. Already nearly 70% of Starbucks Canada caf\u00e9s have transformed pastry cases with the balance to be converted by summer. And our core Frappuccino platform introduced 20 years ago remains very strong and continues to attract both new and repeat customers. Birthday Cake Frappuccino available only by mid-March was a huge success and as Howard mentioned earlier, we had some very exciting Frappuccino and branded Teavana Iced tea beverages planned for this summer. ", "Starbucks China Asia Pacific region, our fastest growing region, delivered another very strong quarter with comp sales rising 12%, the strongest comp sales increase since 2012. With revenues increasing 124%, or 24% when excluding the $270 million incremental revenue from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan, operating income rose 29% from Q2 last year. We\u2019ve more than doubled our CAP store count to over 5000 stores in the past five years. We\u2019ve added 769 net new stores in the last 12 months. We will open our 1600th store in China later this month where we now operate in 87 cities and are on our plan to increase our store count to over 10,000 stores in count over the next five years. ", "Passion for coffee and partner customer engagement in CAP are among the highest of any market in the world. In response to customer and partner demand, we expanded availability of Starbucks reserve packaged coffee. We now offer Starbucks reserve in 136 stores across 10 CAP markets. ", "In Q2, we assumed full ownership of the strategically important Japanese market. Japan is a market we first entered nearly 20 years ago and now with the full ownership we have the ability to further accelerate store growth, expand the Starbucks brand across multiple other channels and cross-sell products into other CAP regions. As an example, we recently introduced Origami, our premium single serve pour-over packaged coffee formerly only available in Japan, into Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea and Mainland China to a strong positive customer response. Our China Asia Pacific business continues to perform extremely well, reinforcing our confidence in the long term growth potential of the market. ", "The evolution of our EMEA business continues with the business reporting a 2% comp sales increase in the quarter, with 2% driven by traffic growth and 1% increase in tickets. We are building our EMEA business by introducing new food and beverage offerings and innovative new store designs while at the same time increasing the sales across all dayparts and successfully building capacity is key. And we continue to enter high customer traffic locations by adding additional channel licensees at venues such as train stations, airports and supermarkets. ", "Equally important, the EMEA team\u2019s laser focus on operations and the ongoing mix shift towards licensed stores enabled that segment to significantly increase both operating margin and operating income despite formidable foreign exchange headwinds, a subject Scott will discuss in a few moments. ", "Channel development, now operating in 41 markets around the world, in Q2 our channel development segment, already our profitable business segment, increased revenue 16% and operating income 23% year on year. At the same time the channel development team increased share of every product within its portfolio, including Roastery, Ground, K-Cup, [indiscernible] teas, our channel development segment remains on track to grow its top line by 60% and its operating income by nearly 100% by the year 2019. Since launch, Starbucks has built its leading position on the K-Cup platform through ongoing product innovation, including the introduction of single Origami coffees and seasonal and LTO offerings including holiday blends and by expanding our channel through distribution. We will continue to innovate around our K-Cup portfolio, including new offerings for summer refreshment, including iced Starbucks coffee and Tazo iced tea K-Cups to brew over ice. ", "And in Q2, our growing food services business, which increased sales of 11% year over year, began serving millions of customers traveling on Delta and Delta connection flights around the world. The global ready to drink coffee market, a market we are uniquely well positioned to lead, is large and growing rapidly. Our plan is to double our international ready to drink coffee business over the next five years. We have taken an important step forward with the strategic partnership we announced last month with Tingyi among China\u2019s largest and most respected beverage companies, combining the Starbucks brand and our 1600 retail store footprint in China with Tingyi\u2019s local manufacturing capabilities, its grocery sales expertise and its broad distribution capabilities positions us to unlock the huge opportunity that exists for Starbucks ready to drink coffees in China. ", "Among the things that impressed me most throughout my immersion has been the pace of innovation that\u2019s taking place at Starbucks. Highlighting all the innovation currently underway across the company in beverage, food, store design, marketing, merchandising, would require many more hours than we have available today. But I would like to share a few highlights of what I believe to be game changing innovation taking place on the customer digital experience. ", "We are delighted with the initial results of mobile order and pay. Our mobile ordering capability now available in over 600 stores across the Pacific Northwest. Starbucks mobile order and pay experience is the proprietary fully integrated technology that allows customers to order their food and beverage selections through their mobile device ahead of time and go to their participating store to pick up the completed order. Our experience to date gives us confidence that once fully deployed, mobile order and pay will drive a significant increase in mobile payment transactions in stores across the US.", "Enhancing our in-store experience with customer focused digital experiences like mobile order and pay creates a positive flywheel effect on our business and attracts more My Starbucks Rewards members. Each new MSR member represents a deeper more personalized customer relationship and more personalized customer relationships allow us to better serve customers and grow our business as evidenced by the significant increase in the number of active MSR members we are serving. For the first time ever, we now have over 10 million active MSR members in the US, up 27% over last year having added 1.3 million new MSR members in Q2. We are now processing over 8 million mobile payment transactions per week, equalling nearly 19% of our US store tender and in Q2 we not only experienced record card redemptions following the record holiday card sales and loads but we also recorded Q2 record card loads of over $1.1 billion for North America, a 19% increase year over year. ", "While mobile order and pay is exceeding every internal goal we set, we are even proud of the difference the technology is making in our customers\u2019 lives. We are receiving positive feedback from many customers. Students who now have time to visit Starbucks between classes, parents who are able to easily order their favorite Starbucks food and beverages while running errands with their children, and busy people from all walks of life who are leveraging this new capability to enable their own personal Starbucks experience. ", "We also received overwhelming appreciation from deaf customers who are now able to easily order and receive their customized beverage just the way they want it. Customer connection has always been core to who we are as a company and we are leveraging the digital assets to expand and enhance that customer connection to what is now more than 16 million active users of our mobile apps in the US alone. We remain on track to fully deploy mobile order and pay to all US company-owned locations before this holiday season. At the same time we will begin testing delivery. In March, we announced that through a collaboration with Postmates, a leading on-demand delivery service, we will enable customers to order food and beverage items using Starbucks mobile app and receive on-demand delivery within defined areas. ", "We are also launching green apron delivery test with our partners delivering orders within specific office buildings. As Howard mentioned, our first green apron delivery test will begin at the New York\u2019s Empire State Building in the second half of 2015. ", "Creating a genuine and Starbucks experience for our customers and an authentic and personal connection between our customers and our partners is core to everything we do. Earlier this fiscal year, we began rolling out a series of investments in support of our in-store partners who deliver the Starbucks experience. Conceived, carefully developed and honed over the past year, the changes we have implemented are already touching 135,000 partners across our US store base. Changes include increased barista and shift supervisor pay rates, additional performance based recognition programs, updates to a dress code, a new food benefit as well as our industry leading college achievement program. ", "We are also investing in digital solutions to automate store tasks, freeing up our partners to focus more of their time and attention on customer engagement. We are beginning deployment of hand-held devices connected with the scanner to simplify things like order \u2013 inventory management. This is just one example of many where we intend to leverage technology to empower in-store partners in support of our mission. This is a journey and we are commanded [ph] to listening to our partners and to deliver further enhancements to the partner experience. We are making similar investments in locally relevant ways to improve our partner experience elsewhere around the world. ", "In closing, and as Howard mentioned, if there is one word to describe Starbucks record performance in the quarter, I think it would be innovation. Innovation around new locally relevant food and beverage offerings, innovation around stunning new store designs, innovation through the creation of new global growth platforms all centered around coffee, innovation around how we serve and engage with our customers and build customer loyalty, innovation around our breakthrough mobile and digital technologies and innovation around how we invest in and connect with our most important asset \u2013 our people. ", "Innovation will continue to drive our business in the future and provide us with the confidence and ability to continue growing our business in markets and channels on a global basis. And while we are pleased with our Q2 performance, we know that we have much more work to do to achieve our aspiration of becoming the world\u2019s most respected and enduring customer brand. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO Scott Maw. Scott?", "Scott Maw", "Thanks Kevin and good afternoon everyone. I am very pleased to comment on the strong Q2 financial results that Starbucks announced today, especially in light of the fact that each of our segments contributed meaningfully to the results. ", "Strong global comp growth of 7% in the quarter demonstrates once again the increase in strength and relevancy of the Starbucks brand. Transaction comps of 3% driven in large part by excellent execution in our key fast growing CAP region exceeded transaction comps in the Americas, reflecting the increasingly global nature of our brand.", "Revenues grew to $4.6 billion, an 18% increase over prior year, despite nearly 2 percentage points of headwind through foreign currency translation. GAAP EPS came in at $0.33 and our non-GAAP EPS also at $0.33 came in ahead of the pre-split consensus. We raised our guidance modestly at our annual shareholders meeting in March and the results we announced today were at the top end of that revised range. ", "Excluding non-GAAP items, operating income increased 23% over Q2 last year to $789 million while non-GAAP operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 17.3% in the quarter. Importantly we saw a meaningful increase in COGS leverage this quarter as supply chain initiatives we\u2019ve previously discussed increasingly benefit our operations. Our year-over-year operating performance improvement becomes even more meaningful in light of the ongoing investments we continue to make around building new stores and renovating existing stores, the partner investments we are making and unfavorable foreign currency translation. ", "I will now tell you about each of our segments and how they performed in Q2. Our Americas segment revenues grew 11% in Q2 primarily driven by a strong 7% comp growth and another quarter of 2% transaction growth. Of the 7% comp growth, food sales drove 2 points of the increase, while beverage innovation and tea drove 1 point each. Noteworthy is that the contribution to comp growth from tea has roughly doubled since we introduced Teavana teas into our Starbucks stores last summer, adding 1 point to comp in each of the last two quarters. ", "In Q2, Americas operating margin expanded 110 basis points over Q2 last year to 22.7%, an excellent result as the bulk of our US store partner investments began in earnest during the quarter. The largest components of the new partner investments were wage adjustments and the introduction of a new food and shift benefit. Altogether these investments impacted Q2 operating income by $34 million and operating margin by 100 basis points. ", "For fiscal 2015, we expect partner investments to total approximately $140 million and this outlook [ph] was fully included in our initial and current guidance. Looking forward we expect modest further expansion of the Americas margin during the second half of the year. ", "Our EMEA segment increased operating income 65% over Q2 of last year to a Q2 record of $29 million. Our licensed store portfolio in the region continues to perform exceedingly well with high single digit comps once again this quarter reflecting the strength and resiliency of the Starbucks brand. At the same time EMEA\u2019s operating margin expanded 470 basis points to a Q2 record of 10.4%, reflecting the continued progress that the EMEA team is making against our plan to improve operations and achieve mid-teens operating margins over the near term.", "EMEA saw a decline in revenues largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation and the ongoing shift from company owned to licensed stores in several markets. These factors coupled with continued consumer weakness in several countries within the EMEA region make this segment\u2019s Q2 performance that much more impressive. We remain confident that EMEA\u2019s operating margins will reach the upper end of our 10% to 12% guidance during fiscal 2015. ", "Our China Asia Pacific segment delivered a 29% increase in operating income to $112 million in Q2. GAAP operating margin declined from 32.8% to 18.9% reflecting the impact of our acquisition of Starbucks Japan. As I have mentioned previously, our Japan stores remain among our most profitable in the world. Excluding the nearly 15 point financial impact of the ownership change in Starbucks Japan, CAP\u2019s operating margin increased by 80 basis points, driven primarily by sales leverage throughout the region, including very strong sales leverage in China. We continue to drive an increase in store unit economics in China and our newest class of stores is delivering excellent first year operating profitability. ", "The CAP team remains laser focused on continuing to deliver substantial disciplined profitable growth. And we are increasing our CAP operating margin guidance slightly as we now expect operating margin to approach 20% for all of 2015. ", "Channel development had an excellent Q2 with operating income increasing 23% to a record $156 million. Operating margin for the second quarter expanded 210 basis points to 36.5% primarily driven by efficiencies in cost of goods sold, strong results from our North American coffee partnerships that delivered its highest quarterly year over year profit growth since 2009 and sales leverage. We now expect approximately 150 basis points of operating margin improvement in channel development in fiscal 2015. ", "Strong results during the first half of 2015 enabled us to generate earnings per share at the upper end of our 16% to 18% non-GAAP target EPS growth range. Accordingly, in March we increased our guidance range and today reaffirm that range with GAAP EPS targeted between $1.77 and $1.79 and non-GAAP EPS targeted between $1.55 and $1.57. For Q3, we are targeting GAAP EPS of between $0.39 and $0.40 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.40 to $0.41. For Q4, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.40 to $0.41 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.43. ", "One further note about our guidance for Q3 and Q4. While we fully expect margin expansion from Q3 to Q4, our earnings growth for Q4 will be slightly below our average earnings growth for the year due to the impact of the partner investments, higher negative foreign currency translation and lapping a particularly strong Q4 of 2014. ", "Revenue growth for fiscal 2015 remains targeted at 16% to 18% despite 2 points of headwind from foreign currency translation. We continue to expect commodities to be roughly neutral in 2015 as compared to 2014. Our coffee team\u2019s passions around coffee pricing paid off, resulting in our costs for fiscal 2015 being below average market prices. ", "Moving on to margin, we now expect a modest increase in fiscal 2015 non-GAAP operating margin over last year, representing a slight increase over our prior guidance. We still anticipate 1650 net new stores in fiscal 2015 but we now expect Americas to have approximately 600 net new stores, slightly lower than previous guidance due to the impact of the closing of the 132 licensed stores \u2013 licensed target stores in Canada. ", "Our EMEA net new store target moves up slightly to 200 and net new stores in CAP remains the same at 850. All other guidance remains consistent with last quarter. ", "A quick note on 2016 coffee pricing. Due to the recent drop in coffee prices, we have been locking in supply for 2016 and are now close to 70% priced for 2016. Our price is somewhat favorable to 2015. We will update you on the impact of coffee prices on 2016 performance as the year progresses. ", "Finally, a few words of caution about extrapolating our current quarter performance into results above the upper end of our guidance. While we are comfortable with the range that we affirmed today, several factors need to be understood on considering the upper end of our range. First, the US store partner investments that both Howard and Kevin spoke about will be fully ramped up during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015, impacting margins for the Americas segment during the back half of the year. We have fully planned for these investments. However the future benefits that will follow from these investments are significant and we will not hesitate to take advantage of opportunities to make additional targeted partner investments that build in strength in the business as we move through the balance of 2015.", "Second, both CAP and channel development had banner second quarters and we fully expect each segment to finish the year very strong. But we do not anticipate a repeat of second quarter performance for either segment. For example, in the back half of 2015, our internal projections call for channel development revenue growth to be closer to 10%, consistent with the growth that we\u2019ve seen over the past several years. ", "Finally, foreign exchange is becoming an increasingly challenging headwind with over 2 percentage points of negative impact on both revenue and earnings growth planned into the back half of 2015. This was not contemplated in our plan or our initial guidance for the year and we are still planning to deliver earnings growth of 17% to 18% despite over 2 points of currency impact. In fact, we modestly increased both the top and bottom ranges of our full year EPS guidance last month. We believe that this level of growth will represent best in class performance, the right level of investment in our partners and an industry leading return for shareholders. ", "One final subject before turning the call to Q&A. In the past we\u2019ve given guidance for the upcoming fiscal year during our third quarter earnings call, even though our annual operating plan is typically not finalized until September. Kevin and I have been discussing this and given the size and scale of our increasingly complex and global business, have decided that going forward we will move future guidance to our Q4 earnings call, enabling us to complete and fully [ph] our plan prior to providing guidance. We assure that this change is not related to Q3 performance to date. In fact, we are quite pleased with how the quarter has started. Nor does it signal any coming change in long term targets. It does not and our long term targets remain unchanged. Instead, we are making this adjustment for the sole and simple reason that doing so will result in a more complete and informed forward guidance conversation. ", "Q2 represented another quarter of strong growth and excellent financial and operating performance for Starbucks, all around the world. As we enter the second half of 2015 and look to the future, we are ideally positioned to continue benefitting from the investments we are making in our people, in our stores and in innovation and to continue providing world class returns for our shareholders. We will continue to update you on our progress as we move throughout the year. ", "Now I will turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore ", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about mobile order and pay. Couple of questions related, one of them is you are about halfway through the year, and you have 650 stores and you are looking to accelerate I think quite nicely in the back half. If you could talk a little bit about what you\u2019ve learned that will allow you to accelerate that pace. And the other piece we are curious about is are you seeing that only people who already used mobile pay are using the order and pay or are you actually attracting new customers to the use of the app now that you have the ordering capability?", "Adam Brotman", "This is Adam Brotman. I will take the second question first. The answer is yes, we are seeing new customers coming in and use \u2013 joining us are using mobile app and also use mobile order and pay. So this is not just leveraging the strong base and you already have in our mobile commerce platform. In terms of the rollout plans and what we are learning, we are very pleased with how this has started. We will actually see a significantly ramped up accelerated pace of rollout in the second half of the year, as you mentioned, we have a big wave of stores coming on this summer and while we continue to learn and optimize couple of areas, for example, the estimated wait time pickup, we are dialing in store level menu and inventory management. These are all things that we are going to continue to improve on but frankly we are ecstatic about the fact that out of the gate our customer and our partners are really pleased with how this is going. In fact, Seattle started out even quicker than Portland and as we roll it into more urban environment that bodes really well and how this is going to continue to drive transactions and be a great thing for our customers. And operationally our partners are telling us there is no impact and are very happy with this as well. So we are excited to accelerate that rollout as you mentioned in the second half of the year. We are also going to be adding for Android app and launching this in the UK and in Canada, all before the end of the year. So we are truly just getting started. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Keith Siegner with UBS.", "Keith Siegner ", "I want to ask a question about the Americas with the check growth. Very impressive, the highest to your ticket growth we\u2019ve seen in many years. And with some of these new premium products like Flat White, like Reserve, like Cold Brew, with them all rolling throughout this year, with the food attach increasing as you talked about, lots of tailwinds here. Could this be the beginning of a run of closer to mid single digit ticket growth in the US?", "Cliff Burrows", "Keith, thank you for your comments about our ticket growth. Perhaps if you like, ticket growth in the quarter we have seen 2% come from food, we have seen 1% from tea, we have seen strength from our base business whether it\u2019s Frappuccino in the Sunbelt, or as you say Flat White all of which helped our ticket in the quarter, plus our routine and disciplined approach to price in the quarter all have helped. Starting the future, I will pass it over to -- ", "Kevin Johnson", "The only thing I would add, Keith, is that ticket mix was blended nicely across the three drivers that Cliff is talking about. So little bit of price, a little bit of above level of premiumization with Flat White and some of the things that we are doing with food and a nice increase in attach. So the mix of that is really helping and so as I said in my comments, I think we are quite excited about how the rest of the year looks but we are still holding to our mid single digit comp guidance as we look forward. ", "Operator", "The next question is from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.", "David Palmer ", "A couple of P&L oriented ones, perhaps for Scott. The COGS leverage was really strong in the quarter as you mentioned and you mentioned in the release, supply chain efficiencies were driving a good bit of this particularly in the channel development segment. But as we look forward how should we think about that COGS line that plus coffee, will that kind of leverage continue? And then separately with regard to G&A, you had a significant increase in the quarter, I think it was 27%. What investments are driving and how should we think about that line as well?", "Scott Maw", "On the COGS point, the short answer is yes. We expect continued leverage. I don\u2019t expect it to be as high as it was this quarter, this was a really good quarter with some of the initiatives that we talked about kicking in and also in crisp business significant continued traction around wage. But we see that leverage continuing in the quarter and we\u2019ve got a number of things stacked up against making sure that happens. And then on G&A, the biggest driver of that at the corporate level is some true-ups that we had around total compensation. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Joe Buckley ", "Just couple of clarification questions, even if I missed it, but could you give the Mainland China same store sales increase for the quarter within that strong CAP number.", "Scott Maw", "We didn\u2019t break it out, Joe but as always China is obviously the biggest contributor to that growth. So we were really happy with what we saw in China this quarter. ", "John Culver", "Joe, this is John. I would just add that, I mean the main driver for the comp growth has been transactions. And the experience that we are providing across the region has never been stronger and in particular what we are seeing is that Starbucks is becoming part of the daily ritual of our customers in China and Japan or in the other markets that we operate in and then the level of frequency of our existing customers and the new customers that we are attracting continues to grow. We are now serving well over 5 million customers a week across the region and extremely proud of the job our team is doing over there. ", "Joe Buckley ", "And then just a question on the Tingyi, if I pronounced that correctly, agreement, how quickly will that ramp up and the bullet in the release mentioned, it\u2019s ready to drink coffee category, will that cover tea products as well?", "Mike Conway", "Yes, Joe, this is Mike Conway. So we currently distribute the Frappuccino product and China today although is in a more limited geographical presence than we would have. From a timing perspective we\u2019re going to be transitioning in 2016 to Tingyi and we expect that with strength of their distribution and their knowledge of the marketplace combined with our strong brand that we will significantly a lot of the growth for China. ", "Howard Schultz", "Mike, you want to just spend a little bit more time on channel development since we haven\u2019t had an opportunity. And also with regard to tea being talked about how many points of distribution it has.", "Mike Conway", "Yes, absolutely. So you also \u2013 Joe mentioned about tea, and yes we will over time be launching tea as well with the Tingyi distribution. We will from a channel to distribution perspective points of distribution they have well over 100,000 points of distribution within China, and for channel development for this quarter, actually very pleased with our results, our 16% growth was quite exceptional and was driven by a number of factors for us. First of all, very very strong programming in-store execution as well as the success of \u2013 and launch of innovations like our new iced K-Cup platform and as we think about the remainder of the year we have other innovations coming on as well including the launch of iced or rather our Coco K-Cups as well and so we expect very strong performance in the back half although expect it\u2019d be more in line with our historical growth of around 10%. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.", "Karen Holthouse ", "Actually another question on the channel development side of the business. So we\u2019ve seen in the last probably few months of on IRI data that pricing has actually come in for Starbucks both on an absolute basis and relative to the market. Just curious so with just the logic behind that if that was seen as an opportunity, even that profit accretion, is it defending off potential entrants into the market with Dunkin moving into more points of distribution, just on the logic behind that and of course congratulations for a fantastic quarter?", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you. From a pricing perspective we actually are quite pleased with the way we were able to balance our base with promotional pricing, you combine that with the strong in-store merchandising that we had, we were able to achieve significant share growth across all of our businesses during the quarter. And so we will continue to monitor the market, continue to monitor pricing and make appropriate shifts but at the moment we are quite pleased with how our pricing is lining up in the marketplace and then in particular how we are driving share in the market. ", "Operator", "The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass ", "A few quarters ago there was a notion of maybe greater partnerships in the tech side either using some of their technology, maybe white labelling some of Starbucks payment platform et cetera. So where does that stand now, what\u2019s your current thinking on that and Kevin, as you come to this full time, maybe are there specific areas that you think are even greater opportunities that you bring your outside experience into Starbucks?", "Matt Ryan", "Sure. We continue to be in a number of active dialogues right now, about a number of different partnerships leveraging mobile. We see the continued growth as being our permission to do more and more in that space. We are not prepared to announce anything specific today and what I can tell you is in the months and year to come there will be more on that front. ", "Kevin Johnson", "Yes, in terms of opportunities for us to better leverage technology, early observation I think we are ahead of the industry in thought leadership around the digital customer experience and we\u2019re going to keep pushing the envelope on that. I think we\u2019ve outlined that for you and there is more ideas even behind that. The area that I think we have opportunity certainly is with our in-store partners on leveraging technology to help our in-store partners with the tasks they have to do that are more about the administrative side of things like inventory management, making it easier for them to do scheduling of our store partners, communicating with our store partners the way we reach in-store partners with training and communications. We\u2019ve got tremendous opportunity to step up our game in that particular area and we\u2019re going to do more there. And then certainly if you look at how we are utilizing information across the enterprise to make more informed and better decisions, whether it\u2019s using data, big data kinds of analytics to help us with store location or big data analytics to help us understand how to do a better job of promoting to our customers at different times of the year. I think those are the big opportunities that we see and we\u2019re going to continue to drive forward with those.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe ", "Howard and Kevin, you are very very clear that mobile order and pay exceeded every goal that you set. So I wanted to get just a little bit more into the details of this. I guess one would think that mobile order we broke the best the constraint or the pinch point I think in your words, would be at the register and not at the barista, and so as that rollout has continued, I mean what you\u2019ve actually learned about increasing barista capacity, I mean is it just an issue of adding more baristas, adding more equipment? And as you think about mobile order, mobile pay over time, how much more latent capacity is just within the existing Starbucks unit because of this technology?", "Howard Schultz", "John, this is Howard. Cliff is going to take that in terms of the details of the question. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we did not intend nor do we foresee adding equipment as a result of mobile order and pay. The incrementality that we are seeing in the early stages strongly suggests that we are going to be able to integrate this well within the engine of Starbucks, with regard to labor, and how we are deploying, I will let Cliff take it. But I would say as Adam shared with you that these early signs of mobile order and pay, this is going to be a much more seamless integration than we really anticipated both in terms of customer response and level of convenience and also I wouldn\u2019t underestimate one other thing which we learned with Flat White and then as our people are so excited and so proud of this initiative and this technology, they\u2019ve embraced it, they are enthused about it, and as a result of that, it\u2019s one of the primary reasons why it\u2019s working so well. ", "Cliff Burrows", "Let me just talk about this. I think one of the things that we are seeing is convenience, improved relationship between the customer and their store where they order, they feel much more in control of it. Food attach is strong in it, and the repeat nature of these transactions is really really helping. It is convenient for the customer, they have no queue time, they come in and go straight to that handout pan and collecting that in turn is bringing up space and taking stress away from the register transaction and we are seeing really encouraging signs of growth peak in our busier stores, which is what is most exciting here. Of those busier stores, we cannot really talk about the Seattle, but where we have put in mobile order and pay we are seeing really strong growth at peak and there has been no additional equipment over and above putting in a printer and receive orders from customers, and it\u2019s really encouraging that we will be able to get more capacity at peak at our existing stores with the addition of mobile order and pay. ", "Howard Schultz", "And could you or Kevin, just talk about how this has been integrated into the ecosystem with regard \u2013 this is not a bolt-on.", "Kevin Johnson", "First of all, the ecosystem you are referring to is the mobile commerce platform which includes loyalty, the mobile app, our card program, our POSs in our store, we\u2019ve integrated all of those together, and it\u2019s actually that entire mobile commerce platform or ecosystem as you heard earlier is accelerating. We are seeing unbelievable numbers of active MSR members, mobile user, will keep the transactions. So it\u2019s into that momentum that we\u2019ve launched mobile order and pay. So this is not a bolt-on, this gets to leverage that existing ecosystem. And I think that\u2019s why frankly our customers are loving it. They don\u2019t have to download a new app, they don\u2019t have to learn something new, this is just seamless for the customers just like additional department. ", "Operator", "The next question is from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino ", "Just a follow up on the mobile order and pay initiative. It sounds like you might be starting to see some increases in My Starbucks Rewards members also as a result of rolling this out. So just wondering if you maybe comment on the though process or how you sort of think about the increase you are seeing in the loyalty program members and how you want to utilize that as you get this rollout, maybe more one to one offers and what you are doing currently or maybe that\u2019s not part of the plan but any thoughts there would be helpful.", "Matt Ryan ", "Sure. This is Matt Ryan and thanks for the question. There are two ways looking at \u2013 there are lots of ways that we\u2019re actually growing our membership and mobile order and pay is one of them. We are actually increasing the strength of our value proposition over time with more offers through one to one, people are recognizing that. People see the convenience within the stores. And because it is a overall initiative to recruit more and more people, we are seeing the growth in the platform. That begets a virtuous cycle, provides and do more things with that platform. Certainly the ability to become more and more targeted and send more offers to the right person at the right time in the way that they want it, is the capability we have been growing here. But the growth of that platform is in fact the permission that we have to do more over time in the digital space because as we grow that engaged space of customers, the adjacent things we can do with them, starting with mobile order and pay, moving on to delivery, and on to other opportunities, it\u2019s going to be an enormous long run play for us. ", "David Tarantino ", "And have you seen in fact that the membership levels in the Northwest has increased since you\u2019ve rolled the mobile order and pay out?", "Kevin Johnson ", "Well, I think as Adam commented earlier, we have seen increase in MSR, with new MSR customers coming to use mobile order and pay. And granted, we're just in the Pacific Northwest right now, so it's still early days. But I think that's a fantastic example of a feature that is a customer-focused feature. It's all about that benefit to the customer, and the consumer. And we think offering those types of benefits and those types of features is part of our mobile app, it will bring more people into the MSR program.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays Capital.", "Jeff Bernstein ", "Just two questions, one on the Americas comp. I don't know if you mentioned this, but in terms of the traffic growth across all dayparts, I was wondering whether you were seeing again stability across all those dayparts, and whether or not that would imply that at this point there are still no real signs of throughput constraints despite obviously the outside comp growth. And then my other question was just on the Americas units. I know that in fiscal \u201815, I guess half of your opening is going to be licensed. Just wondering whether there's any underlying strategy in coming years to move towards more licensed over time, not unlike I guess many of your international markets. ", "Cliff Burrows ", "Thanks, Jeff, and I'll take both the questions. This is Cliff. As we said earlier in the script, we have seen growth in the Americas in all dayparts, all geographies, and across all platforms. It really was a very balanced portfolio. And we are seeing growth at peak times in our busiest stores, which really gives us the encouragement that we are -- we still have room for capacity. And mobile order and pay will only help that in the coming months.", "Secondly, around store growth, this quarter, as we said, was a bit of an anomaly with the closure of the 132 licensed stores in Canada. So that will distort the number a little bit this year. But I think over the coming years, you will see us continue a balance between company-operated and licensed stores. There may be times where it goes up or down, one way or the other. But in terms of strategy, we continue to look for opportunities to grow both our company-operated, and even here in the US, we still see a very healthy pipeline of new opportunities. And we open very soon our first small footprint store in New York, which gives us another opportunity for growth. And as Howard said earlier, with the premium nature of the -- building off the Roastery, we have again another opportunity for growth. So, we see the pipeline out into the future being very healthy, balanced between company-operated and licensed.", "Howard Schultz ", "Let me just add a few things to that. For those of you who have followed the company for many years, it wasn't that long ago that our stores closed early in the evening, 7, 8 o'clock at night. And most of our business, 15% or so was driven before 10, 11 AM. In the last few years, I think Cliff and his team have done a wonderful job of two primary things. One, dealing with peaks times and being able to drive throughput in a way that would not create a transaction driven environment but really honor the customer and now with mobile order and pay that\u2019s going to leverage it more but the big news in the last couple of years is identifying dayparts and need states through unique products in which we could leverage the fixed asset of the store. So lunch, as an example, is driving a significant level of visits and incrementality both in traffic and in ticket. The new opportunity with smoothies in terms of health and wellness, identifying that need state and leveraging that daypart opportunity, which is mostly refreshment in the afternoon in health and wellness.", "And the one thing we have not talked about, either in the script or the Q&A, is the advancement of evenings, which we're very excited about. And so all these things have given us the ability to integrate new product, new levels of innovation, and identify need states and dayparts that five years ago, candidly, were not part of the unit average volume. If you looked at the average volume of Starbucks both in terms of mature stores and probably most importantly, new stores, we are experiencing the best performing new store class in our history. And one of the primary reasons is what I've just described. Then you leverage MSR and mobile order and pay on that, and your imagination can really -- I can't begin to think about how much volume we can put through these stores. And I think we're just getting started with a level of innovation we think that food team can create. And so that's why we're so excited about the future in terms of the opportunity to drive incrementality in existing and new stores.", "Operator", "Next question is from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.", "Nicole Miller ", "Whoever put the coffee in Delta, thank you so much. And on that note, can you talk a little bit or just walk us through, I think it's 100% of coffee blocks for this year. We know it's favorable. Can you give us any color on how much? We were also supposed to see a benefit of lower on dairy and diesel, I think, in the back half of the year. Are you seeing that? And then also, thank you for the color on \u201816 and the lock there. Price is lower again -- by how much? Just wondering, can we flow that through, or do you want us to assume you'll make investments against that? Thanks.", "Scott Maw ", "Thanks, Nicole. So as it relates to \u201815, what you have to remember is that coffee prices throughout 2014 were quite low. So for a long time, they were in the $1.20 and $1.30 range. And so 2015 coffee prices, despite the fact that we were patient and waited out all the spikes above $1.90 and bought it far below average market prices, our coffee is actually a little bit unfavorable year over year. But that's much more about how low 2014 was and -- than it is around 2015. We actually did a really good job buying below the market. So a little bit of unfavorability, and a very little bit, offset by favorability in dairy and diesel. That's kind of how the year is shaping up.", "When we gave guidance all the way back in the summer, we expected coffee prices to come down, just given what we saw in the market. We didn't know they were going to come down, but we expected that. We waited, and we were patient; and when they came into our target range, we filled up our needs for the year. So that's how to think about \u201915, roughly flat, a little bit unfavorable on coffee, a little bit favorable on dairy. On \u201816, because we did so well in \u201815, despite the fact that we've locked at slightly lower prices, again, that favorability while meaningful it is probably not as high as you might calculate based upon average market prices. So we'll give you more update. We still have a full third of our coffee to price. We will give you a bit more update as we move into \u201816 and become more specific.", "Operator", "The next question is from Diane Geissler with CLSA.", "Diane Geissler ", "I wanted to ask on the CPG business. I think Danone announced on its earnings call that it was co-branding an Evolution Fresh product with you, yogurt product. Obviously the Tingyi deal, I think, is a big deal in the CPG space in China for 2016. So, just kind of going back two analyst days ago, which would've been, I appreciate, quite a while ago, where you talked about the CPG space, and how you thought it could rival the size of the US retail business at some point in the future. Could you talk about your growth plans within CPG which I think you've obviously crystallized around the K-Cup business. But there's lots of opportunities in a lot of different aisles in not only the Americas, but also in China. So could you talk a little bit, maybe add a little bit more detail around that? ", "John Culver ", "Yes, Diane, this is John Culver, and I am going to take that. Clearly the CPG business, first off, had a very strong quarter and it continues to grow. Our expectation is that it will continue to grow at that double-digit rate in the foreseeable future. Now as we look at the growth, that growth is being driven by our core coffee, and really K-Cups is a big piece of that. As we look at other areas of growth, though, we see tremendous opportunity to grow outside of coffee. The biggest is the tea opportunity, and in particular with the Tazo Tea, and then as we introduce Teavana tea down the aisle and through ready-to-drink as well.", "And then we've also worked very closely on Evolution Fresh. And Evolution Fresh today stands in over 11,000 doors across the country. The CPG share that we have both in natural as well as in traditional FDM is very strong, and it continues to grow. We just repackaged the product. And we now have new packaging, an 11-ounce and a 15.2 ounce. And then we've also launched Evolution Fresh smoothies in our stores. And we anticipate launching Evolution Fresh yogurt, with fruit on the bottom, in our stores with our Danone partnership. So, for us, these are all investments that we continue to make in our channel business given the relevance and the strength of the business. And also we are very optimistic about the future growth of the business going forward.", "Operator", "The next question is from Will Slabaugh with Stephens Inc.", "Will Slabaugh ", "One more question on channel development, but more on the international front. I don't know if you had an update that you could give us there on some key markets internationally, sort of where you stand now versus what type of growth you might expect in those key markets in the next couple of years as you might hit your goals.", "Mike Conway ", "Well, thank you. This is Mike Conway. We see channel A specific as being one of our most important markets going forward. Certainly with the partnership we have with Tingyi, China will be a big market for us, particularly driven by the size of the ready-to-drink energy and coffee business. And we also -- Japan is one of our longest-standing ready-to-drink markets. While it is somewhat mature, at the same time there's a lot of growth for us there, particularly with the move that we made now fully owning the Japan market.", "Beyond that, there are a number of the emerging markets that we're really focused on. We still have fairly emerging business within our Latin America region. And we're looking at markets like Brazil to establish a presence there, another big market for us. And then we have an established relationship in Arla but we have probably the largest number of markets \u2013 I am sorry, in Europe -- we have the largest number of markets in the EMEA, and we are going to continue to drive our business there as well. But the UK, France -- those are some of our largest markets. So as I think about the significant growth that we have for ready-to-drink coffee, we are really looking at the CAP region as well as Latin America.", "Operator", "The last question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company.", "Andrew Charles ", "Just wanted to touch base with Adam on the mobile payment just jumping to roughly 19%; had been stuck for a while around 15%. Just wanted to know what you attributed the increase in mix to.", "Adam Brotman ", "Thanks, Andrew. This is Adam. It's a great question. I would say the core ecosystem that Howard and I were talking about earlier is an interconnected set of parts that all have momentum. So the fact that MSRs -- you've seen the momentum in MSR. You've seen the momentum in mobile active users in general. You\u2019re seeing the momentum in card loads and card redemptions. And those things are all tied together, so like the flywheel, they all power one another. And so it's not a surprise that we're seeing that kind of acceleration happen when it comes to mobile payments as well, over 8 million per week, approaching 19%-plus in the US in terms of percentage of tender. And it just speaks to the momentum and the overall mobile commerce platform in general.", "End of Q&A", "JoAnn DeGrande ", "Thanks, Mike. This concludes Starbucks' Q2 fiscal 2015 earnings call.

My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "Thank you. Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2015 results, which will be led by Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO joining us from New York, and Kevin Johnson, President and COO, and Scott Maw, CFO, here with me in Seattle.", "Also joining us for Q&A are Cliff Burrows, Group President US Americas; John Culver, Group President China and Asia-Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands; Adam Brotman, Chief Digital Officer; and Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer.", "This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last report on Form 10-K.", "Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to our website at investor.starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.", "This conference call is being webcast, and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website at investor.starbucks.com.", "So with that, let me now turn the call over to Howard.", "Howard Schultz", "Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today's call. Starbucks third quarter of fiscal 2015 stands as among the most remarkable quarters in our over 23 years as a public company. Our global comp store sales grew 7%, driven by a stunning 4% increase in global traffic.", "Let me put that 4% traffic increase figure into perspective. A 4% increase in global traffic on a business of our scale translates into having served over 23 million more customer occasions in Q3 of 2015 than in Q3 of 2014 or an average of approximately 25 more customer occasions every day from every single store in our nearly 10,000 store global comp base.", "Our fast-growing Americas segment posted 8% comp growth, also driven by 4% increase in traffic and a 12% increase in revenues. EMEA delivered 3% comp growth with over 2% from increased traffic and a 23% increase in operating income.", "As we announced last week, our EMEA segment is preparing to open its first store in Johannesburg, South Africa during the first half of calendar 2016 in partnership with established food retail operator, Taste Holdings Limited. We believe that South Africa could ultimately support 150 or more Starbucks stores over time.", "Starbucks fast growing China/Asia-Pacific segment now with over 5200 stores delivered company leading comp growth of 11% in Q3, virtually all of which coming from increased traffic.", "Our now fully owned and controlled Japan market, our first international market outside of North America and a market in which we now operate over 1000 stores, delivered among its strongest quarterly comp sales increases in years. And I'm very pleased to report that we now have exceeded 1700 stores across 90 cities in mainland China.", "Cap remains a focal point of our future growth plans, and we are on track to meet our goal of doubling our cap store count to roughly 10,000 locations, tripling our revenue to over $3 billion and tripling our operating income to over $1 billion over the next five years.", "Strong global comp sales growth, combined with record performance from our new store class, drove an 18% increase in total company revenues to a Q3 record of $4.9 billion and a 24% increase in non-GAAP EPS to a Q3 record of $0.42 per share.", "Noteworthy is that our Q3 results were achieved despite continued meaningful investment in food and beverage innovation, our mobile and digital platforms and our partner experience investments.", "All of which these investments will continue in Q4 and despite formidable foreign exchange headwinds and difficult retail and consumer environments in many of the global markets in which we operate.", "Starbucks Q3 of fiscal 2015 was a fantastic quarter across the board, clearly evidencing a continuation of the strong momentum we've seen across our business and around the world this fiscal year and solid in-store execution by our people who now deliver the Starbucks experience through nearly 80 million customer transactions from over 22,500 stores in 66 countries around the world every week.", "In a moment, I will highlight a few of the innovations and strategic initiatives and digital partnerships that were announced or took shape in the quarter that will enable us to further extend Starbucks global coffee authority and leadership around all things coffee and tea, retail, mobile and digital and position us to continue to grow, lead and win around the world and into the future.", "Then I'll turn the call over to Kevin who will take you through coffee and beverage innovation and total company and individual segment operating performance in the quarter. Finally, Scott will take you through our Q3 financial and operating results in detail, and we'll close the call out with Q&A.", "Two years ago I reported on the seismic shift in consumer behavior that would significantly impact traditional bricks and mortar retailers. I was not clairvoyant. The coming change was apparent.", "Since then, many traditional retailers and consumer brands have responded simply by substantially increasing their digital advertising budgets, significantly driving up their cost of customer acquisition and producing little to show for it. We on the other hand, took a very different approach.", "By further enhancing our already world-class digital technologies through the introduction of capabilities like Mobile Order & Pay and soon to be delivery and expanding our loyalty program, we are driving traffic as reflected in the 4% growth in traffic in Q3.", "Bringing in new customers and deepening our connection to our existing customers, elevating the Starbucks brand and our customer experience and streamlining our in-store operations.", "At the same time today, you will hear about unique digital partnerships that we are forging with like minded businesses in a number of verticals that will further leverage the Starbucks brand and our digital assets in order to further reduce our already low cost of customer acquisition and drive additional incremental traffic.", "Starbucks superior customer experience depends in part on delivering world class service and convenience, and we are pleased to report great progress on several game-changing initiatives that are only in their infancy.", "We first introduced Mobile Order & Pay into 150 of our company operated stores in the Portland area last December and then quickly expanded it to the full 650 store Pacific Northwest region in March.", "Given the powerful positive impact Mobile Order & Pay had on our business in Portland and Seattle, we accelerated the rollout of this offering and now offer this innovative mobile capability in over 4000 of our US company operated stores.", "And we are now on track to offer Mobile Order & Pay capability across the entire US company operated store portfolio in time for the upcoming important holiday season.", "Mobile Order & Pay is enabling us to serve more customers more quickly and efficiently and to significantly reduce attrition off the line. We are already seeing positive impact on operating results.", "But keep in mind that the rollout to 4000 stores occurred only in the last couple of weeks of the third quarter. So the real impact for Mobile Order & Pay and increased convenience remains in the quarters and years to come.", "That said, mobile order and pay is fueling both revenue and profit growth in every market in which it has been deployed with customer adoption starting faster and accelerating with each new phase we roll out.", "By enabling our customers to order ahead and avoid waiting in line, Mobile Order & Pay is enabling us to capture more on the go customer occasions, and the data is clear.", "In those stores where Mobile Order & Pay has been deployed, lines are shorter, service is faster and in-store operations are more efficient. The net result is increased traffic, incrementality that is exceeding expectations, improved throughput and an elevated Starbucks experience for our customers.", "We will add the Mobile Order & Pay feature to our Android app in the US, as well as introduce Mobile Order & Pay technology into our international markets in the months ahead. Importantly, key features like suggested menu recommendations that will drive increased ticket have not yet been deployed, as we are still in the beta mode.", "In another important initiative designed to improve Starbucks superior convenience, we have opened our first express store in New York City, and while it still very, very early in terms of how many days it's been open, initial results are nothing short of extraordinary.", "In approximately 500 square feet of space, we are now handling volumes we would normally expect from a store 3 times its size and nearby stores less than a few hundred feet away have not seen any adverse impact or cannibalization.", "This helps validate the assertion that we made at our investor conference last December that many places in the US we have far more demand than our current stores conserve, indicating opportunities to significantly grow our domestic store footprint in the years to come.", "And the express store is only one of several innovative new formats that we are pursuing to take advantage of the different kinds of real estate opportunities we need to address in order to tap into the demand that exists for more Starbucks occasions.", "The initial success of Mobile Order & Pay in the express store are testaments to the growth potential that remains for us in the US where our ability to serve demand rather than the need to create demand will be key to our achieving our growth.", "In addition to more express stores, another will open in New York City later this summer. The next big initiative to satisfy customer demand and provide added convenience is delivery.", "We remain convinced of the huge demand for Starbucks delivery to your home or office and are on plan to pilot delivery in Seattle and in the Empire State Building in New York City before the holiday.", "We have no doubt that delivery like Mobile Order & Pay will drive further incrementality and increase profitability and enhance the equity of the Starbucks brand.", "Just as digital technologies are enabling us to add convenience with features such as Mobile Order & Pay and delivery, digital technologies are enabling significant expansion of our My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program.", "MSR continues to be our most important business drivers as new members contribute not only short term increases in revenue and profit, but also to long-term loyalty for years to come. We now have 10.4 million active MSR members, up 28% from Q3 of 2014 with 6.2 million being Gold members, up 32% from Q3 last year.", "The significant increase in Gold level membership means that an increased number of our MSR customers are transacting in our stores more frequently than before with MSR members now accounting for approximately 30% of total tender in North America.", "And our mobile commerce platform is literally stronger than ever. We have reached the milestone where mobile payments now represent 20% of all in-store transactions in our US stores, more than double the figure from only two years ago, and we are now processing nearly 9 million mobile transactions each week.", "Now our plan all along has been to bring both our MSR membership and our digital capabilities to scale, and we are now there, and so then leverage the Starbucks brand, our deep engagement with customers, our global store footprint and our world leading mobile digital card and loyalty assets to create the foundation of a much broader external mobile digital and loyalty platform. One that would extend to purchases and experiences outside of the four walls of the Starbucks store.", "This new digital external platform will enable businesses whose customer demographics are similar to our own and with whom we choose to partner. To purchase stars from Starbucks and then to distribute the stars in order for them to acquire, retain and reward their own customers with the gift of Starbucks. And what's really wonderful about this opportunity is that gift can only be redeemed at a Starbucks store.", "Let me explain the enormity of this emerging digital and loyalty opportunity to you through the lens of the first three expanded loyalty partnerships that we've recently announced.", "The first partnership we announced was with Spotify. Under the arrangements, Spotify will purchase Starbucks Stars from us and then distribute these Stars to drive premium subscriber acquisition.", "It will allow Spotify to differentiate themselves from competitive music streaming services and reward customer loyalty. In addition and as an added benefit to our own employee partners, all Starbucks partners are being given a Spotify premium account ", "free of charge.", "The second partnership we announced was with the New York Times. Under the Times arrangement, as with Spotify, the Times will purchase Starbucks Stars from us and distribute Stars to drive customer acquisition and to reward customer loyalty.", "And as an added benefit, Starbucks customers will be provided with free, unique, curated New York Times content to the Starbucks digital network within our stores.", "Our third digital and loyalty platform partner is Lyft, one of America's leading mobile transportation network companies. As part of our partnership, Lyft will purchase Stars from us and distribute the Stars to increase customer acquisition and loyalty, reward their drivers and distinguish Lyft from competitive services.", "There are a number of innovative elements to this partnership, but a few that highlight the like-minded nature of our companies include that we will be making all Lyft drivers Gold members of our MSR program and that Lyft will be offering their writers the ability to thank their drivers with Starbucks e-gifts.", "In addition, later this year we'll be testing the possibility of introducing a convenient and cost effective transportation benefit to Starbucks employee partners in conjunction with Lyft in order to gauge partner interest and to determine the long-term viability of this benefit.", "What each of these partnerships affords is the opportunity for consumers to earn Starbucks Stars outside of Starbucks stores and then to redeem them for their favorite food and beverages within Starbucks stores, providing a unique opportunity for incrementality, increased profitability and the opportunity for us to serve, connect with and become part of the daily ritual of an even more larger based number of consumers, and adding further momentum to Starbucks unique increasingly global flywheel.", "And since each and every Star has significant perceived value to our MSR customers, these digital platform partners will be conferring a meaningful benefit upon their new and existing customers and even their drivers in the case of Lyft.", "We strongly believe that no other bricks and mortar retailer has the brand strength, digital and physical assets or connection to consumers to create, build and execute a program anything like this.", "We have identified prospective partners in multiple attractive business verticals, and you may expect to hear about many more carefully curated, customized digital partnerships in the quarters ahead as we roll out this proprietary Starbucks Star-centric digital and loyalty ecosystem.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?", "Kevin Johnson", "Thanks, Howard. Good afternoon, everyone. Before handing off to Scott to take you through the financials, I thought I'd build on Howard's comments about the quarter and share some personal observations.", "As Howard made clear, Q3 was an exceptional quarter as measured by any standard or metric. Ongoing beverage innovation and global leadership around all things coffee and tea remain at Starbucks core.", "In Q3 we continued to invest and elevate the premium, highly differentiated, locally relevant coffee and tea, beverage, food and in-store experience we deliver to our customers around the world.", "We grew global revenues by 18% over prior year to a new quarterly revenue record of $4.9 billion with a 7% increase in global comparable store sales, representing our 22nd consecutive quarter of comps sales growth of 5% or greater and on the heels of global comp sales increases of 6% in Q3, 2014 and 8% in Q3, 2013.", "These are truly extraordinary topline results given the size, breadth and complexity of our increasingly global operation. 4% of our comp growth came from increased traffic, a testament to the increasing strength of our business and the global relevancy of the Starbucks brand.", "In addition to driving strong revenue growth, we also expanded operating margins 70 basis points to a Q3 record of 19.2%. We grew operating income by 22%. This reflects a Q3 record, $939 million of operating income and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 per share.", "I think there are three core drivers of this momentum. Number one, we are delivering innovation that is relevant to both our customers and our employee partners. Two, we are driving operational execution on a global basis. And three, we are leveraging the scale, reach and breadth of our capabilities.", "Our fast growing Americas segment is firing on all cylinders, opening 658 net new stores over the past 12 months and posting an 8% comp growth in Q3 with a 4% increase in traffic. This resulted in 12% revenue growth and 17% operating income growth.", "Ongoing beverage innovation that resonated with our customers and increased food attached across all regions and dayparts contributed meaningfully to the Americas segment's outstanding performance.", "Q3 was the 22nd consecutive quarter, and the Americas delivered comp growth of 5% or greater. More importantly, transaction growth for the quarter of 4%, the best in six quarters was an extraordinary accomplishment and reflects the success of our efforts to drive traffic and incrementality through ongoing beverage and food innovation and increased store throughput.", "Core beverage offerings contributed half of the US comp growth in Q3 with blended and espresso platforms driving over two thirds of that growth. Beverage innovation such as flat white, Frappuccino minis and cold brew combined to contribute approximately 1 point of comp growth and continue to perform ahead of initial expectations.", "S'mores Frappuccino, a new limited-time offering, became the highest selling LTO Frappuccino ever. Noteworthy is that Teavana branded shaken iced teas continue to resonate with our customers, helping drive a 10% increase in tea beverages in our US stores and again contributing 1 point of comp growth.", "We continue to make progress, creating new locations and growing our lunch and afternoon dayparts. Food sales contributed over 2 points to US comp growth this quarter, once again representing double-digit revenue growth over the prior year.", "Our expanded breakfast sandwich platform delivered 30% net revenue growth with half of that growth coming from increased attach. Our lunch platform continues to grow, delivering greater than 20% growth in Q3 with the noteworthy success of warm sandwiches, bistro boxes and wraps, reflecting the fact that Starbucks is increasingly being recognized by our customers as an attractive option for lunch.", "In addition to growing new dayparts, we've also made significant progress growing transactions at our peak daypart through a combination of great in-store execution and positive early results around innovative new store formats.", "We are especially pleased with the progress we're making in growing transactions at peak even before Mobile Order & Pay is fully rolled out across the US company operated store portfolio in time for the upcoming holiday season.", "Our new class of stores are performing extremely well, generating record first year sales and unit economics. Noteworthy is that our new stores are delivering record performance without cannibalizing sales from established stores in the local trading area. The data suggests that we are creating deeper engagement with our existing customers, and we're attracting new customers to Starbucks.", "US licensed stores are seeing similar patterns and delivered strong results with revenue increasing 27% year-over-year. Looking ahead to Q4, we're confident that our rich pipeline of innovation will deliver a strong finish to the year.", "Starting with cold brewed and Teavana mango black tea lemonade, both launched just in time for the summer heat and are exceeding initial expectations. The carefully curated selection of innovative, delicious new snacks to enhance our afternoon daypart offerings.", "Customer feedback and research has shown us that snacks represent 50% of all American eating occasions each day, with busy lifestyles on the rise, the demand for snacks both in the moment or planned is increasing.", "Our new portfolio of snack offerings is available in more than 3,400 high traffic Starbucks stores in major metropolitan areas. We continue to innovate around all things food with positive response customers.", "Let's now take a look at the EMEA segment. EMEA third quarter results continued the segment's steady, measured improvement in profitability, despite the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation, the primary driver of the 9% decline in reported revenues over prior year.", "Excluding approximately $44 million of FX, the impact of the closing and transfer of certain stores from company-owned to license, EMEA revenues actually increased 5% in the quarter.", "Comparable store sales in EMEA grew 3% in Q3, despite the FX headwinds and macroeconomic challenges in several markets, with a 2% increase in traffic representing its ninth consecutive quarter of positive comp growth with every EMEA market posting positive comps. EMEA also delivered a 320 basis point increase in operating margin and a very strong 23% increase in operating income over Q3 last year.", "Our EMEA license markets are performing exceptionally well with Turkey and the Middle East in particular continuing to outperform. EMEA's results support our license-focused growth strategy for the segment where 66% of our nearly 2300 stores in Q3 were licensed, as compared to only 54% three years ago. We will continue to accelerate growth in our EMEA license store portfolio as demonstrated by two very exciting new partnerships.", "In June, we entered into an important partnership with Casino Restauration, one of France's largest and most respected grocery retailers to open Starbucks stores within a number of casino stores. We view partnerships in the grocery channel in Western Europe as an opportunity for Starbucks.", "And just last week, we announced plans to enter South Africa in partnership with Taste Holdings, a leading South African restauranteur, and we'll be opening our first store in Johannesburg during the first half of 2016. We will look to extend into other markets in Central and Southern Africa over time.", "As aggressively as we are growing our license business in EMEA, we are equally committed to improving the profitability of our company-owned store portfolio in the region, and we are making continued progress on that front. Scott will provide details on that progress in a moment.", "Our China, Asia-Pacific segment delivered an amazing quarter with company leading comp growth of 11% and revenue growth of 127%, 20% excluding the $390 million incremental revenue from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan. Overall, cap operating income grew by 49%.", "We've added 750 net new stores in cap over the past 12 months. Our new class of company operated stores in cap is even more profitable than the prior class, reflecting the increasing strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand in the region and improved operating leverage.", "We remain on track to increase our cap store count to 5500 by fiscal year 2015 and roughly double our store count to over 10,000 stores over the next five years.", "As Howard mentioned, we've now surpassed 1700 stores operating in over 90 cities in mainland China. The passion and commitment of our partners in China is enabling us to deliver a great customer experience that is driving strong comp growth throughout the region.", "Our business in Japan delivered among the strongest quarterly comp sales increases in Japan in years. We are benefiting from solid execution against our plans to leverage our brand in connection with consumers to drive growth in all channels and across all dayparts in the key Japanese markets.", "By way of reminder, Japan company-operated stores are not yet in our global comp base. We will include these stores in both the global and cap comp base beginning in Q1 of fiscal year 2016.", "Limited-time offering Frappuccinos in particular are extremely popular in Japan. Our spring and summer promotions featured locally developed products that have successfully positioned Starbucks as a top of mind destination for summer beverages.", "The increasing strength of the Starbucks brand in Japan gives us confidence that with full ownership we can accelerate growth in this market as we head towards our 20th anniversary in Japan in 2016.", "At our recent store opening, in the Tottori prefecture, the last prefecture in Japan without a Starbucks store, 1000 customers queued up for the store opening, and more than 50 reporters showed up to cover the event.", "Starbucks brand strength spans the entire cap region. It is not limited to China and Japan. In fact, Starbucks ranked 15th on Nielsen's annual regional list of Asia's top 1000 brands for 2015 and has been ranked as the number one restaurant brand in Asia for the fourth year in a row.", "Let's now move on to the channel development segment. Channel development revenues of $404 million in Q3 were up a solid 8% over the prior year, despite the increased competitive pressure in the at-home coffee categories and the timing of the Easter holiday which impacted the comparison to Q2 of this year.", "K-Cup portion pack sales continued to be a primary driver of the revenue growth for channel development, and we are very pleased that our total K-Cup portfolio continues to gain share, despite increasing price pressure and new market entrants.", "Innovation has been a key driver in establishing our leadership position in the K-Cup category and will continue to drive our sales growth.", "Cinnamon dolce and mocha performed very well in Q3 as our flavors platform increased its share of the total category, and Starbucks iced coffee K-Cups launched only three months ago gained strong momentum ahead of the peak summer season.", "Looking ahead, we are excited for customers to experience our third K-Cup beverage, hot cocoa. A new platform we are launching with classic and salted caramel hot cocoa flavor profiles.", "Ongoing innovation, combined with increased marketing activities in Q3, give us confidence that we will continue to extend our leadership position on the K-Cup platform.", "Foodservice had a strong Q3 with 14% revenue growth year-over-year. We offer a very broad product portfolio to the foodservice trade that is becoming increasingly appealing to businesses seeking to differentiate themselves by providing employees and guests with premium amenities in these establishments.", "Beyond the US, we're seeing strong growth in China Asia-Pacific ready-to-drink sales, underscoring the size of the opportunity presented by the strategic partnership we announced with Teeney [ph] where we are on track to launch ready-to-drink Frappuccino through a large number of outlets in 2016.", "As part of our plan to accelerate growth of ready-to-drink products in international markets, I am pleased to announce our expansion throughout Latin America ready-to-drink with our long-term business partner, Pepsico. Starbucks has been operating in Latin America for 13 years and now has more than 870 stores in 14 markets with plans to add several hundred more stores in the years ahead.", "The new agreement with Pepsi will bring the Starbucks ready-to-drink coffee and energy portfolio to this important region and will leverage the Starbucks brand and store footprint, along with Pepsico's marketing and distribution capabilities, in order to unlock the growing $4 billion Latin America ready-to-drink coffee and energy business.", "Customers will see Starbucks ready-to-drink bottled beverages throughout the grocery and convenience store channel in 10 Latin America markets in calendar year 2016. Innovating in ways that amplify our leadership in coffee is a key strategic priority.", "Starbucks immersive 15,000 square-foot Starbucks reserve roastery and tasting room continues to attract customers and tourists from all over the world and is exceeding our most optimistic expectations.", "The roastery is also enabling us to build a new ultra premium coffee brand, Starbucks Reserve. With the additional small batch coffee roasting capacity provided by the roastery, we can outsource, roast, blend and market spectacular, limited availability, micro-lot coffees from around the world under the Starbucks Reserve brand.", "This is elevating the super-premium coffee experience we deliver to our customers, and we're able to find many Starbucks reserve varietals sell out as soon as we bring them to market.", "To facilitate the expansion of the Starbucks Reserve brand, we are leveraging some of the design elements from the roastery to create a new store format called Starbucks Reserve that will showcase both our super-premium Starbucks Reserve coffees from around the world and the newest coffee brewing methods.", "Starbucks Reserve stores will also incorporate an integrated Teavana kiosk to increase customer awareness and interest in Teavana super-premium loose-leaf and packaged tees. We expect to launch new Starbucks Reserve stores in targeted global markets over the next year, laying the foundation for an exciting, highly differentiated, new global growth opportunity for us.", "We're on plan to open our new Starbucks reserve flagship store sometime later this calendar year, and we are already opening Starbucks Reserve coffee bars within selected existing Starbucks locations across the US as part of normal Starbucks store renovation cycles.", "I'm confident that the addition of Starbucks Reserve coffee bars will drive incrementality in existing Starbucks stores and build customer awareness around our new Starbucks Reserve brand.", "After more than six years on the Starbucks board, combined with the past five months deeply engaged with the management team, I must say it's a privilege to be a part of the Starbucks journey.", "I want to thank all my Starbucks partners for the great work they do to create that magical Starbucks experience for our customers each and every day.", "I'll now hand the call over to Scott to take you through our Q3 financial results in detail. Scott?", "Scott Maw", "Thanks, Kevin. And good afternoon, everyone. The Starbucks business has performed exceptionally well in fiscal 2015, and our third quarter reflected the continuation of prior quarter's trends.", "Strong global comps, record revenues, record operating margin and record operating income once again demonstrate the impact and the success of our laser focus on our customers and our customer experience and fantastic execution by our partners across the globe.", "Our Q3 results are particularly meaningful in light of the size of our global system today and the increasing complexity of our business.", "Our Q3 GAAP EPS came in at $0.41 and non-GAAP EPS at $0.42 per share, 24% over prior year and our strongest quarter in 2015 thus far, despite a meaningful ramp in the investments we are making in the business.", "Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 100 basis points in Q3 to 19.5%, and excluding non-GAAP items, our operating income increased 24% over last year to $950 million. Sales leverage from the Americas and cap segments and an increase in COGS leverage drove this improvement.", "Clearly, the supply chain initiatives we have previously discussed and are implementing are benefiting our operations in a significant way. In fact, we have seen 120 basis points of gross margin improvement to date in 2015.", "In addition, we remain on track to eliminate $1 billion of supply chain costs over a four-year period. I would like to personally and publicly thank all of our supply chain partners across the globe for helping us deliver our Q3 results and our future supply chain savings while at the same time supporting the very significant growth in our business.", "I'll now take you through individual segment performance in Q3. Our Americas segment grew revenues 12% in Q3, primarily driven by strong 8% comp growth with transactions and ticket contributing 4% each.", "Americas operating income grew 17% over the prior quarter in Q3, reaching $855 million, a record high and a particularly excellent result, considering our US store partner investments continued to ramp during the quarter.", "Operating margin expanded 120 basis points over Q3 last year to 25%, and importantly sales leverage was significant, more than offsetting the approximately 80 basis point impact from increased partner investments.", "Our EMEA segment increased its operating income 23% over Q3 of last year to $36 million, a Q3 record. EMEA's record results are even more impressive in light of challenging macroeconomic conditions across the region, significant foreign exchange headwinds and the fact that only two short years ago EMEA was essentially operating at a breakeven operating margin.", "Particularly noteworthy is that EMEA's operating margin expanded 320 basis points to 12.2%, also a Q3 record. Continued progress against our plan to improve operations and evolve our store portfolio from company operated to higher-margin license stores drove double-digit operating margin for the fourth consecutive quarter.", "And our license store portfolio in EMEA continues to perform exceedingly well with high single-digit comps for the seventh quarter in a row.", "Our China Asia-Pacific segment continues to perform extremely well in Q3, delivering company leading quarterly comp growth of 11%, a 49% increase in year-over-year operating income to $150 million and becoming our second most profitable business segment for the first time in our history.", "GAAP operating margin and cap declined from 35% to 23% as a result of the impact of our acquisition of Starbucks Japan. As Howard and Kevin mentioned, we have a very long and opportunistic runway of growth ahead in cap with stores that continue to deliver among the highest profitability and strongest unit economics of any stores in the world.", "Excluding the nearly 16 point financial impact from the ownership change in Starbucks Japan, cap's operating margin increased by 370 basis points. Strong revenue growth and margin expansion driven by the performance of company-operated stores, as well as sales and operating leverage, all contributed to cap's excellent results.", "Channel development's operating income increased 3% to $143 million, while segment operating margins decline 160 basis points year over year to 35.5%, largely a result of increased marketing to support our ongoing product introductions and commodity copy costs.", "Noteworthy is that our portfolio continues to increase its share of the K-Cup category despite competitive pricing pressure from new and existing market participants. Year-to-date performance in channel development remains strong with 11% revenue growth, margin expansion of 220 basis points and an 18% operating income growth.", "I want to shift gears a bit and take a moment to discuss our balance sheet and capital deployment activities. Earlier this month we took advantage of the continued low interest rate environment to opportunistically refinance our $550 million 6.25% coupon senior notes that were due in 2017 with $850 million of lower coupon 7 and 30 year bonds. This transaction enabled us to both reduce our interest expense going forward and to significantly extend the maturity of our debt.", "Upon redemption, we incurred a charge of approximately $63 million that will impact our P&L in Q4, namely for the premium related to the early redemption of the 2017 notes. This charge is included in our updated GAAP targets that excluded from our Q4 non-GAAP targets.", "As we've previously shared, we will target share repurchases at least equal to the dilutive impact from our broad based stock compensation programs. We've also noted that we will modestly add to debt and may from time to time increase the pace of our buybacks.", "Given the strength of the quarter and the favorable economics on our most recent debt offering, we increased our buybacks somewhat in the quarter. In Q3 we returned a record $874 million of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.", "And today I am pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional 50 million shares under our ongoing share repurchase program. This is on top of the 11 million shares that remained available at the end of Q3.", "Strong results during the first nine months of fiscal 2015 enabled us to deliver both earnings per share above our initial EPS target growth range and current quarter earnings above our updated range.", "Our full-year GAAP EPS targets are now $1.77 to $1.78, and we are increasing our full-year non-GAAP EPS target range to $1.57 to $1.58. This relates to GAAP EPS growth of 31% to 32% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 18% to 19% for the full fiscal year.", "Noteworthy is that this growth above our initial non-GAAP EPS growth range of 16% to 18% and that it will be accomplished despite 2 points of foreign exchange impact on both our revenue and earnings per share growth rates. For Q4, we now expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.39 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.43, consistent with our prior guidance.", "A few comments on our Q4 guidance. We're expecting another excellent quarter in Q4, albeit with somewhat lower earnings growth rate than we delivered in Q3. This is consistent with what I had noted on last quarter's earnings call. And I want to again clearly caution against extrapolating Q3's extraordinary performance onto Q4.", "Several factors support the Q4 guidance we have announced. First, we are continuing to ramp our partner in digital investments. They will reach their peak in Q4 and be up notably from Q3 levels.", "Our results this quarter demonstrate that these targeted, carefully considered investments are beginning to bear meaningful fruit, and we will not hesitate to accelerate investment where we see opportunity. Second, we expect the impact of foreign exchange on our top and bottom line will be at its peak in Q4.", "And finally, we are lapping over phenomenal results in Q4 of fiscal 2014 when we reported an operating margin above 20%, our highest operating margin ever, which was 280 basis points over prior year on a non-GAAP basis.", "Breaking down Q4 operating margin by business unit, we expect Americas to deliver year-over-year margin improvement that is somewhat lower than the 90 basis point improvement year to date.", "GAAP operating margin is expected to finish the year slightly above 20%, which is significantly higher than our initial guidance. The cap's Q4 margin will be roughly flat to Q3's very strong 23%.", "Channel development's operating margin in Q4 is expected to be up nicely from Q3, but down slightly compared to last year Q4, reflecting the challenging and competitive retail environment, additional marketing investments and somewhat higher coffee costs.", "Finally, EMEA operating margin is expected to show strong year-over-year expansion with the full year margin - operating margin at or slightly better than the high end of our 10% to 12% guidance range.", "For the total company, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be up from Q3, but down slightly from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of the Japan acquisition, offset somewhat by favorable operating and COGS leverage.", "We continue to expect commodities to be roughly neutral in 2015 with coffee somewhat unfavorable and dairy offsetting this impact. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 16% for the year, including two points of FX impact. All other guidance for 2015 remains consistent with what I shared last quarter.", "One final reminder before turning the call back to Howard and then on to Q&A. As I mentioned on our earnings call last quarter, we will be providing our initial growth targets for fiscal 2016 and all future years during our fourth quarter earnings call.", "Given the size and the scale of our increasingly complex global business, we've been contemplating shifting the issuance of this guidance from Q3 to Q4 for some years now in order to have it coincide with the completion of our annual operating plan. The shift will allow us to thoroughly vet our AOP prior to providing targets. Finally, I would point out that we are now over 80% locked for coffee costs into 2016 at rates slightly lower than 2015.", "Starbucks' strong year-over-year financial performance demonstrates our commitment to delivering best-in-class financial and operating results, while at the same time investing in our future growth, building new stores, renovating existing stores, deploying new technology and investing in our partners and delivering an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers.", "We believe that by getting the balance right, we will be able to continue delivering best-in-class growth, profitability and increased capital returns to our shareholders.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Howard. Howard?", "Howard Schultz", "Scott, thank you so much. Before we head into q-and-a, I just wanted to make one comment as it relates to how you might be looking at comps and traffic going forward. I think I speak for everyone at Starbucks in saying how proud we are and how gratified we are that we've been able to put up the kinds of numbers that really are unprecedented given our scale.", "But I've said in previous quarters and I think it's really worth repeating again, that we don't expect internally to maintain these kinds of very high level, high single digit comp numbers and the kind of traffic numbers that we provided with you today.", "So I would hope that there is common language and common understanding that the guidance we've been giving for years now is mid single digit comps, and I would hope that you would hold us to that. And if we are in a position to surprise on the upside, that's wonderful, but not to count on it and certainly not to model it.", "In our quarter, this quarter demonstrates a unique opportunity for many, many things that have come together. We're certainly going to work very hard to reproduce that. But I think going forward mid single digit comps numbers and a modest traffic number should be the kind of number you are putting in your model. And I hope that you would respect that as we go forward to Q4 and fiscal 2016. Thank you very much. JoAnn?", "JoAnn DeGrande", "All right. Thanks, Howard. Mike, go ahead and open up for Q&A today, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] First question is from Keith Siegner with UBS.", "Keith Siegner", "Thank you and congratulations on such a record quarter. As exciting as the Mobile Order & Pay is and you all know how excited I am. A lot of others will eventually get somewhat close. What I think really is interesting about this is the ecosystem expansion, such a long-term competitive advantage.", "So Howard, when you think about this expansion is there any limit to this? Is this a nice slow gradual pace? Is this something that can get really broad and pervasive? I mean there is no precedent for this, right. How do we think about this ecosystem expansion with other retailers evolving?", "Howard Schultz", "Well, let me try and answer this way. I think you have to go back to the 2 years when I did share with many of you the concern that I had about what is meant to be a bricks and mortar retailer today in terms of the challenging issue of mobile commerce in the web. And that has resulted, I think, in lots of activity that is not producing the kind of positive results across all of retail, especially those that are mall-based.", "So, on the one hand, traditional retailers that are bricks and mortar based are longing for ways in which to accelerate and leverage their core assets and specifically drive traffic as opposed to waiting to intercept it.", "I think we've established not only a very successful application in Mobile Order & Pay, but we've established Stars as a currency that is highly relevant to our customer base. And when you look at our customer base, at how broad it is and the demography of it.", "When we start looking at verticals and like-minded companies, it's very easy for us to integrate our data against the way in which our customers are shopping and spending their free time and spending their money.", "And as a result of that, we've identified a number of companies in unique verticals that we think sequentially can be part of this external ecosystem. However, like anything else, I think that we have to walk before we run, and I think we have a core responsibility to demonstrate to the initial partners that in fact, the proposition that we created is going to drive incrementality for them.", "I can tell you that the phone has rung with many, many inquiries from both regional and national retailers in all types of business, who are very much interested and intrigued to be part of what it is we're building.", "Now there is a company and you probably have seen it, and that\u2019s what plenty is doing, and what they're doing is assembling an amalgamation of companies as part of that ecosystem, and you see many companies jumping into that.", "What's different about what we're doing and why I think it's going to be better and more proprietary is that we are offering a single currency, and that currency has to come back to Starbucks, and we know that the value of a Starbucks store and the equity of our brand is very, very relevant to this kind of proposition.", "So the short answer to your question is, I think this is a very big idea, but it's an idea that I think we have to prove internally and prove to these partners. And you are going to see sequentially more partners in the quarters to come. And I think it will be more than a domestic opportunity over time as we introduce Mobile Order & Pay and the features and benefits in the international markets.", "But this strategy goes back 2 to 3 years when we started talking about leveraging this internal system once we got the scale and creating this external flywheel, and I think we're in a very unique position that will create incrementality and a very low-cost of customer acquisition.", "So - and I think what we're trying to do here is recognize that we can't embrace the status quo. We have to keep pushing for innovation inside and outside of our stores, and we have to be as relevant for our customers on their phone as we are inside the Starbucks experience.", "And I think this is exactly what we're doing. I think the first three partnerships represent a level of diversity in terms of New York Times, Spotify and Lyft, and you're going to see a lot more in the days ahead.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass", "Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about the Mobile Order & Pay rollout. My ultimate question is if you're willing at this point to talk more specifically about the kind of lifts you're experiencing in the older markets that when it's rolled out?", "If you're not willing to talk about that more specifically, can you talk about to what extent these are new - when people are joining in, is it new members to through my Starbucks Rewards, the existing members?", "How deep is the penetration, the usage in your existing user base of the My Starbucks Rewards? Any kind of qualitative comments around that would be helpful.", "Howard Schultz", "Go ahead, Adam.", "Adam Brotman", "Okay. Thanks, John. This is Adam. So, first of all, specifically to answer your question, we're seeing both our existing user base using order and pay, as well as bringing in some new members into the My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, as well as them using the Mobile Order & Pay.", "And while we can't breakout specifics as you mentioned, it's worth noting that obviously this program is gaining tremendous momentum. We've been exceeding our own internal expectations in terms of the number of mobile orders we are seeing, in terms of incrementality that we are measuring, and in terms of the qualitative factors like customer and partner satisfaction are all exceeding our expectations.", "And that's even more true in our busiest stores, which bodes well as we continue to finish the US rollout in such cities as New York and San Francisco and Chicago. And I'd also add that we're seeing we are happy to be seen that the adoption rate is accelerating as Seattle actually started out faster than Portland, which we were quite happy with and then this last wave, the Sunbelt has succeeded even that in terms of its initial adoption rates.", "So we have momentum, we're just getting started, and you can imagine we're pretty excited about this.", "Operator", "The next question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.", "Joe Buckley", "Thank you. A couple questions if I can. The deals with Spotify, Lyft, New York Times, do they all involve a commitment to buy certain number of Stars, and are there upfront payments for the Stars?", "And just explain a little bit more how it works? And who is heading up that effort, Howard, is it you at this point, or is it Kevin or someone else within the organization?", "Howard Schultz", "Sure. Kevin, do you want to take that?", "Kevin Johnson", "Sure. I'm happy to Howard. Yes, Joe, thanks for the question. I think that without getting into the specifics of each of these deals, they all have a common element which is each of these partners is paying us for Stars that then will be used to reward MSR customers or in the case of Spotify or the New York Times for subscription, in the case of Lyft for rides, and in the case of Lyft for some benefits they have for their drivers as well.", "In each there is a range of terms in each of those agreements, but there is a fundamental principle around how we're going to pivot and help them achieve their goals in terms of subscriptions, and rider ship, and in return they are going to buy Stars or pay us for Stars, they are going to reward MSR customers for those benefits, and that's where it becomes a win-win-win, if you will.", "MSR customers win because it's another place for them to earn valuable Starbucks Stars that they can redeem at Starbucks. Starbucks will win because that will bring traffic into our stores, and our partners will win because we are going to help them bring MSR customer base and bring customers to their offerings, whether it is subscriptions or rides, and we're going to go from there. So certainly, that is the foundational concept behind the 3 deals that we've done in the vision that we have going forward.", "I think, as Howard mentioned, we've got to walk before we run, and so right now I think the plans are to get to Spotify this fall, and we queued up New York Times and Lyft in January, early Q1 calendar year 2016.", "And in the interim, we're going to continue to have dialogue with other interested partners. But I think the priority right now is we're going to make sure that we do a great job with these first three partners and that our customers have a great experience, our partners get benefit from that, and that's where we are going to put our energy.", "In terms of your questions around who's managing this, I mean obviously a big part of this links into the digital experience we've created with our mobile app. And so Adam Brotman and his team are doing a lot of the software development that's enabling this. Certainly between Howard, Adam, Matt Ryan and myself, we've all been involved in these dialogues and helping shape these.", "I think we're now at a point where we're going to now start formalizing organizationally where the accountability is to scale it. But now clearly the implementation of getting this done is the responsibility that I have along with Adam Brotman.", "Joe Buckley", "Okay. And then one more if I could, on the 4% transaction growth, that is obviously a very, very strong number. Can you talk about what you've done? You mentioned peak hour throughput transactions being up, but if you are doing 4%, I'm sure they have to be up.", "But what have you done to kind of streamline that process. You know Mobile Order & Pay, I'm assuming wasn't in enough stores long enough in the quarter to have too much impact. So what else is going on to help drive those transactions?", "Cliff Burrows", "Thank you, Joe. It's Cliff here. The focus has been on all the basics in our stores, and really those peak hours in the mornings in our busiest stores, we have really focused on labor and making sure we have enough labor in the right place. That is helping us sell to more customers.", "We're also seeing an increase in occasions with the work we're doing around dayparts, and that can be lunch, that can be our Frappuccino platform, right through to the evenings in stores. And all of those are helping us to grow all our stores across all dayparts, and it really is an absolute focus on the basics.", "You're right in your assumption that Mobile Order & Pay is not yet a material part of that. As Adam said, it launched too late in the quarter. But we are really encouraged by the work we're doing investing in our partners, investing in labor and stores, and serving more customers.", "Joe Buckley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore", "Thank you very much. I wanted to actually ask about food and in particular in daypart expansion. In particular, when you talk about you have some very aggressive growth in some of the categories breakfast and then even lunch.", "Could you maybe help me think about ultimately if you have an idea about where food could get to in terms of share of mix? Are there limits by not having a full kitchen?", "And on that note, could you maybe update us on Starbucks Evenings, the rollout there, and how you would think about that daypart a bit more expansively?", "Cliff Burrows", "Thank you, Sara. And as was highlighted by Kevin, we've seen a real growth around that breakfast daypart, driven in part by the breakfast sandwiches seeing a 30% growth, lunch as we've expanded into that. We've seen a very healthy 20% growth in that daypart.", "And it really is focused from the work we started with level large products, feels like almost 3 years ago now and great quality ingredients that are resonating with our customers. We keep refining and improving not only the choice of food, but the relevance of the different dayparts. As we expanded our offer of Teavana shake and teas, again the complement to lunchtime food gives us encouragement that we're in the right direction here.", "We said in the analyst conference at the end of last year that we would see our food mix growing up to the mid 20s% in terms of percentage of mix, and I think that feels like a good place directionally. We are now up to 20%. We've seen a 1 point increase in the mix. So directionally heading that way and we have a good line of sight on it.", "Evenings we have rolled out the Evenings program to stores across different parts of the country. We are still in the early phase. We will see the expansion of Evenings to hundreds of stores in the US over the next 12 months.", "And that again gives another opportunity but only to introduce wine and beer, but to strengthen our food offering to be part of that Evenings software complemented by teas, coffees and a range of beverages.", "We've also expanded many of those new food offerings, certainly breakfast sandwiches and lunch, and our pastries into our Canadian business and into many of our license store partners. And it is the first time we have had an aligned range across such a wide portfolio.", "So that will also help us strengthen the relationship with our customers in terms of a consistent offer and also focus on delivering great quality food for our customers.", "Kevin Johnson", "I would just add and we commented on this last quarter, if you look at the ticket in the US business, the 4 points that you see there, there is a really healthy mix of ticket. There is a little bit of price in there, but by far the majority of that is a combination of premiumizations [ph] overseeing the customers trade up within categories or across categories and then attach. And so that 4% is as healthy as we have seen it over the past few years.", "Sara Senatore", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Palmer with RBC.", "David Palmer", "Thank. Good evening. What are you learning in the rollouts of mobile order intake from an operational execution standpoint, particularly as you get into the thousands of stores? How are you finding the customer satisfaction, especially with regard to having that beverage perfectly ready when the customer wants?", "And if your partners or consumers are suggesting tweaks or opportunities for the app or execution, can you share any of those? Thanks.", "Howard Schultz", "Adam, why don't you start and then Cliff can talk about the in-store expenses.", "Adam Brotman", "Okay, David, this is Adam. First of all, the thing that we're learning are that we can continue to refine. In fact, my guess is we will do this for a long time and making sure that our estimated pickup time algorithm is always based on what we're trying to improve.", "We are very happy with how it's working in beta mode and so happy that we're going to continue to accelerate our rollout. But that's something that we're continuing to work on.", "We're also learning that our customers are requesting things like the ability to have very specific store by store menus being turned on. That's something that we plan on turning on before the end of this year in fact. So we're working on that, so that you can have a - you can order things like Clover and Visio and Evolution Fresh smoothies.", "So those are examples of the kinds of things that our customers are asking for that we are in the process of improving as we speak. And then, of course, putting those capabilities onto our Android app and then starting to roll out in the UK, Canada and elsewhere around the globe. So those are kinds of examples, the things that our customers are asking for. Cliff?", "Cliff Burrows", "Yes, I would say, David, the acceptance and enthusiasm from our partners across the country has been incredible. They feel well trained. They feel ready for the rollout and customer adoption, and usage of the new app has just been fantastic.", "And we keep learning and we keep tweaking, but the ramp-up rates and the adoption rate that Adam talked about earlier has just got stronger with each rollout. We now have some high volume stores, which has allowed us to pressure test what happens in those stores. And in fact, those are the ones where we are seeing the strongest adoption, and it does bode well for the future.", "So far, all the learning\u2019s are good. I think that piece Adam said about getting store-specific menus so that the customer can order just what they want in their store. And I think the other one is just the excitement and the pressure to get into all of our stores as a standard part of our offer.", "Adam Brotman", "And David, this is Adam again. Just to add on to what Cliff said, it's something that's worth noting that, if you look at our opportunity with Mobile Order & Pay and assumed delivery, we have an absolutely unique and differentiated capability because unlike any other consumer brand retail or restaurant company, we already have an industry leading integrated card loyalty and mobile assisted with massive momentum and usage of Stars that are relevant to our customers and fully integrated into the POS system into the operations of our stores.", "So it gives us a unique and differentiated ability to roll something like this out in a seamless and elegant manner and one where our partners and our customers are adopting it. So we are very excited about our differentiation into Mobile Order & Pay.", "David Palmer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.", "Karen Holthouse", "Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I actually have another question about food. And as you continue to see this platform grow across dayparts, is there anything you've noticed in terms of the mix of customers using it?", "Is it something that seems to be skewing millennials, something that's skewing older, and then also usage patterns in urban versus suburban preferred the grab and go food?", "And then in particular, is there any difference in how consumers are capitalizing on the drive thru for sort of Starbucks as a non-fast food drive thru option.", "Cliff Burrows", "Well, there's a lot there, Karen. I would say that we are seeing more similarities than differences across the country. Drive thru we focus primarily on a narrower range and opt in our bestsellers on new introductions or seasonal changes. But if somebody wants and is familiar with a wider range, they just order it.", "We are seeing bestsellers the same across the country, and there's no particular SKU to millennials. I think the lunchtime offering tied with tea, ice-shaken teas is a new development for us. There is a strong drive towards the breakfast sandwich platform, and that really is across the country.", "One of the things that has been extremely encouraging is our strongest food markets have gotten even stronger with this new food offering. And that is what is most encouraging. It's not everybody catching up the traditional markets for us.", "We've had our biggest adoption, and people buying the food have gotten stronger. And we see that this will continue to grow. I think the other thing that we have with this frozen distribution model is our availability product has increased significantly. Mobile Order & Pay is helping us again to improve that availability by us knowing exactly what the customer wants.", "So a lot of changes to the supply chain, a lot of refinements to the operational practices in stores. And at this stage, we are not tailoring to a particular group, but we are also taking the opportunity to bring in some locally relevant products.", "BC with a diverse supplier there, and also in New York with an opportunity with a local supplier. And I see that plus the grab and go snacks as some of the curated offers that we can start to put in the stores to complement our base.", "Karen Holthouse", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Tarantino with Robert W Baird.", "David Tarantino", "Hi, good afternoon. I have a question about the China, Asia-Pacific segment and the strength that you're seeing and the traffic trends there. Just wondering if you could elaborate on we think is driving that strength and maybe comment in particular on China?", "And we've heard a lot of macro concerns about China, but it seems like your business may be charging right through those. So perhaps could you elaborate on what's driving the strength in your mind?", "John Culver", "Yes. Hey, David, this is John. Clearly we continue to see very strong momentum across the region, and the 11% comp growth is indicative of that, 10% of that was transactions. We're tracking more customers now than ever before into our stores across all the markets we operate in.", "And when you look at the comp growth in China, as our comp growth in China has outperformed the overall regional comp growth again this quarter, which is very encouraging.", "A couple of things that are in play. First is the relevance of the brand and the fact that we are building this coffeehouse ritual and more and more customers are coming in. We're increasing the level of frequency of our existing customers, and then we're also attracting new customers into the brand each and every day.", "In addition, what we're seeing is that as we've accelerated the store growth across the last several years is that our stores are more accessible. And with that, we're also seeing very strong performance from a financial standpoint in the first year stores, as well as in the second and third year age class stores as well.", "Digital is becoming a bigger piece of our business across Asia to include China. We now account in several of our markets 40% of our transactions is done through the Starbucks card. And so digital is becoming a bigger piece of that.", "And then the last piece I would say is, when you look at the store designs and the store environment that we're creating, we are truly creating a third place inviting environment for our customers to come with their family and friends, and this is resonating very strong.", "Yesterday, I had the opportunity to hand out awards for the top store designs, and it just reminded me of the fact of both the beautiful stores and the beautiful spaces that we're creating across the region.", "The big opportunity that we have going forward is this morning daypart and the development of the morning daypart. And increasingly we're seeing more and more relevance towards morning, but we do see this as an opportunity to continue to develop and grow that.", "But we're highly encouraged by what we're seeing across the region and in particular in China. As Howard mentioned, 1700 stores now in over 90 cities, and we're well on our way to that 10,000 store goal across the region over the next five years.", "David Tarantino", "Great. Thank you.", "John Culver", "Yes.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe", "Thank you. Howard, in your prepared remarks and I'm not going to call you exactly, but I'm going to try, but you said that Starbucks' opportunity was about serving existing demand as opposed to creating new demand. And that was just a very interesting comment just related to the latent demand that presumably exists within the United States.", "And as you think about all the different things that you have that can bring additional customers, whether they are new customers or you are bringing in existing customers more often into existing Starbucks stores and into new Starbucks stores.", "Can you compartmentalize really how big of a revenue opportunity that you see for Starbucks in the Americas that can be reached, or just to your existing store footprint, maybe how much is available over time through new store footprint and a bigger variety of different formats?", "Howard Schultz", "Let me try to answer that in a number of ways. First off, I think you would all agree that unequivocally we have proven and demonstrated that anyone who a year or two or even three thought that Starbucks might be achieving a level of saturation in the US or North America is clearly not the case.", "I think the ability that we have from a design standpoint and real estate acquisition to create segmentation in our design and uniquely be able to position Starbucks has given us opportunities that perhaps very few people thought existed in terms of the size and scale of the market.", "I can't give you the specific number, but I can tell you that we believe that we are a long way from the average unit volume of a Starbucks store achieving its ceiling. And I think one of the unique strengths that we've developed over the last couple of years is being able to identify need states and then to link that need state with the right product made for our customers in a customized fashion.", "And so, you know, John, you've been covering the company for many, many years, and so you know perhaps better than anyone else that there was a time when Starbucks' entire business pretty much happened 70% to 80% of it before noon. Well, that's not the case today.", "What's happening today is that we have identified, developed and executed against the strategy of leveraging the fixed asset we have throughout the daypart by creating need states products, and now we're going to extend that to evening.", "So when you link the fact that we still think we're in the early stages of what the average unit volume could be, coupled with our ability, I think this is the third, maybe the fourth consecutive year of best-of-class new store performance, given our store base, its pretty unusual.", "And what I was trying to say in my prepared remarks and don't take me literally is that, we are not in the business every single day of just trying to intercept traffic. We're in the business of creating demand through the experience, the trust in the brand, the social impact of what Starbucks is about, the trust the people have in who we are as a company, and obviously the value proposition and the unique experience that people are having.", "I think it's over 20 years now that we have talked about the relevancy of the third place. We haven't talked about that in quite some time. The truth of the matter is that the third place that we have established all over the world has become as relevant as the product itself. And so when you couple all of these things together and you create the kind of position we now have in the marketplace and you can leverage that scale.", "And I think the thing we have done really, really well and it's quite a challenge is, how do you get big and stay small? How do you maintain intimacy and trust with your customers and your brand when you are as ubiquitous as Starbucks has become?", "And the way you do that is through local relevancy and the kind of product design and experience that we've now been able to create around the world.", "Its one thing to talk about 23,000 stores in 67 countries, but the fact is if we transported ourselves to China or Spain or France or Malaysia or Singapore, today, you'd see and feel the kind of experience that you were enjoying in New York City.", "Yet it's highly localized, highly relevant and most importantly the culture and values of the company continues to be the brand competitive difference of what we've been able to create around the world.", "So I still believe these are early days for the company, not only in terms of the innovation that we've talked about digitally and through Mobile Order & Pay and other things that we have in the pipeline, but our core business. And our core business is reconfirming every single day our leadership position in all things coffee.", "Kevin touched on the roastery, the roastery and Starbucks reserve is a big, big idea that is going to put a halo on the entire company, as we are not going to allow any small company or independent in any way to subordinate our position as a leader in all things coffee.", "And the interesting thing about that and then I'll stop because it's pretty long winded, is not only are we able every single day to reaffirm our leadership position in all things coffee, but at the same time create the kind of beverages that are more impulsive like Frappuccino in ways that are accretive to the brand and not dilutive to the brand of coffee.", "And so once again, I think we're doing things that are very difficult to do in terms of balancing scale, relevancy, the equity of the brand, product innovation and most importantly really taking the company from a typical bricks and mortar environment just 3 years ago to a new arena and kind of reinventing what it means to be a traditional bricks and mortar retailer whose relevancy has to be where people live, where they work and where they play and on every device that they are using in terms of the equity and the emotionality of the brand.", "John Ivankoe", "Thank you.", "Operator", "That was our last question at this time. I will now turn the call back over to JoAnn DeGrande.", "JoAnn DeGrande", "Thank you, Mike. Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate your time. This concludes our Q3, 2015 earnings call. We'll speak with you again late October when we report fiscal year end 2015. Thank you and have a good evening.", "Operator", "This concludes today's Starbucks coffee company's third quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call.

My name is Mike, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.", "Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your conference.", "JoAnn DeGrande - Investor Relations", "Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 year-end results, which will be led by Howard Schultz, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Johnson, President and COO; and Scott Maw, CFO. Joining us for Q&A are Cliff Burrows, Group President, U.S. Americas; John Culver, Group President, China Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands; Mike Conway, President, Global Channel Development; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; and Adam Brotman, Chief Digital Officer. Given all we have to discuss today, both Q4 and 2015 year-end results, along with introducing our initial fiscal 2016 growth targets, we anticipate this call will run longer today than our typical quarterly earnings calls.", "This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements and our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC including our last report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.", "Please refer to our website at investor.starbucks.com to find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. This conference call is being webcast, and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website at investor.starbucks.com later today.", "Let me now turn the call over to Howard.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, JoAnn, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks record Q4 financial results highlighted by stunning comp store sales increases of 8% globally, 9% in the U.S., and our second sequential quarter of a 4% increase in global traffic, underscores the strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand around the world and the success of the investments we continue to make in our people, in our business, in new beverage and food innovation, and in ground-breaking technology innovation that is deepening our connection to customers everywhere.", "Noteworthy is that Q4 represented our 23rd consecutive quarter of global comp store sales growth of 5% or more, a remarkable achievement given the scale, breadth, and complexity of our business and the fact that our global comp base now includes nearly 10,000 stores in countries and markets around the world.", "In Q4, Starbucks increased revenues to a record $4.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS to a Q4 record of $0.43 per share, and for the full-year we generated record revenues of $19.2 billion, record non-GAAP EPS of $1.58 per share and we served over 72 million more customer occasions from our global comp store base than we did the year before.", "Starbucks' performance throughout fiscal 2015 was outstanding by any standard, metric, or comparison. We are connecting more deeply and more meaningfully with more customers across all day parts than ever before, and we are delivering quarter after quarter of record-breaking financial results despite the accelerating shift in consumer behavior away from traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing and despite difficult macroeconomic retail and consumer headwinds that continue to challenge traditional retailers.", "At our Investor Conference last year, we laid out for you our five-year strategic plan for growing our business and continuing to deliver world leading financial and operating performance and long-term sustainable profitable growth into the future. Starbucks is playing the long game, and our plan is premised on seven core strategies that are guiding both our focus and our execution.", "Let me start with the first of our strategies. Creating brand differentiation to an elevated in-store customer experience brought to life through our over 300,000 Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the green apron, the best most engaged and customer-centric people in all of retail today.", "Starbucks will continue to lead and to succeed, first and foremost, because of our partners. The investments we make in our partners and our partners' connection to our customers and our brand are at the center of what drives Starbucks' business and sets us apart from every other retailer in the world.", "And the investments we make in our partners pay tangible dividends in the form of more satisfied and engaged partners, deeper connections among partners, and with customers and improved in-store efficiency, all of which contribute to an elevated in-store Starbucks experience for everyone, partners and customers alike.", "Noteworthy is that today we are seeing improvements in partner attrition, a direct result of our partner investments at a time when the industry overall is actually moving in the opposite direction.", "And we are seeing a direct correlation between reduced partner attrition and our business results. Our comp results are strongest where we are having our greatest success in reducing turnover. There is no doubt that our partner investments link directly back to our ability to post record profits, industry-leading global comp store sales increases, and back-to-back quarters of 4% increases in global traffic, and that they are driving our business.", "As for the second of our core strategies; coffee leadership. I couldn't be more proud of the many ways in which we are extending our lead and creating greater distance and separation from our competitors. The Starbucks Roastery we opened in Seattle, last December is the first of several roasteries we have planned for major cities around the world, is clearly the world's definitive immersive coffee experience and the anchor of a new initiative in building 500-plus coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores in key global markets around the world. The Starbucks Reserve store we just opened in London just last month to tremendous customer response and acclaim is emblematic of our Starbucks Reserve store, the strategy and the initiative that's coming to life.", "We continue to elevate and bring premiumization to the entire coffee category with our Starbucks Reserve brand. The Starbucks Reserve offers consumers the finest assortment of exclusive micro-lot coffees from around the world and is now available in thousands of Starbucks stores globally, reflecting a diversity of origin and sourcing capability that only Starbucks can deliver. We have now built seven Farmer Support Centers around the world, most recently in Sumatra, Indonesia, with the eighth opening in Mexico in 2016. Our Farmer Support Centers provide an on-the-ground agronomy service that promotes sustainable best-farming practices and augment our comprehensive approach to ethical sourcing.", "Earlier this year, we verified 99% of our coffee as ethically sourced and our rigorous approach to environmental and social best practices in growing and processing coffee has enabled us to achieve this recognition. To date, more than a million farmers and workers on four continents have benefited from our farmer support programs, once again demonstrating Starbucks coffee leadership and authority and our commitment to giving back to the people around the world who support our partners and our business and the communities in which we operate.", "Now some years ago, the suggestion was made that Starbucks may be reaching store saturation in the U.S. The data reported since demonstrates that nothing could be further from the truth. As in the intervening years, we have opened thousands of new stores with each successful class of stores outperforming the prior class. And our newest class of stores is performing at the highest level in our history, generating first-year average unit volumes of $1.4 million, up nearly 20% from only three years ago, while also delivering record profitability and returns on investment. At the same time, we continue to open new Starbucks stores and introduce dynamic new best-of-class store designs and formats like our express stores and drive-thrus, while meaningfully growing comps and without any net cannibalization of existing Starbucks stores operating in the same trading area. We cannot identify any other retailer that can make these kinds of claims, especially in today's very tough retail environment.", "Our strategy for sustained long-term profitable growth is also emphasizing and identifying new customer need states and creating and fulfilling new day-part opportunities and occasions in our stores, growing our business in tea with the Teavana brand, and building our CPG business by leveraging customer affinity with the Starbucks brand, our strong customer loyalty and further extension of Starbucks Stars' down-the-aisle initiatives.", "By creating more opportunities for more people to engage with us more often both inside and outside of our stores, Starbucks has successfully integrated and coordinated retail and wholesale strategy in driving our business and our growth around the world. It should be mentioned that no national or global retailer has been able to leverage a retail store footprint into a CPG business remotely approaching the size, scale and profitability of Starbucks. Today's Starbucks CPG business represents both a prime profit center for us and a powerful complementary channel of distribution.", "Finally, a few thoughts on how we are leveraging technology digital engagement and loyalty to drive your business. By anticipating and beginning to invest many years ahead of the mobile technology curve, Starbucks today is defining customer-facing and partner-facing mobile and retail experiences of the future. And the technology innovations we are introducing are further strengthening our brand, improving our efficiency and in-store execution, increasing our profitability, enabling us to further extend our lead over competitors and, most importantly, enabling us to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers.", "Starbucks occupies a front-row seat at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds like no other company anywhere in or out of retail. Our unique combination of assets that includes a growing global physical footprint of now over 23,000 stores, deep consumer engagement and trust in our brand, millions of customers every day and breakthrough mobile and digital technologies are together enabling us to extend our reach and deepen our emotional connection to customers everywhere in ways that were not imaginable even a few years ago. Our customers trust us and reward us with unparalleled frequency and loyalty, as demonstrated by the robustness of our business, the unprecedented increases in global traffic we are seeing, and the amount of currency preloaded on our customers' mobile devices. We continue to leverage all these assets in ways that are accretive to our business and to the heritage of our company.", "Our industry-leading mobile app has emerged as an evolving platform and profit driver of its own, creating multiple touch points that will continue to drive incrementally and create new business and profit opportunities for us in the future.", "The partnerships we've recently announced with The New York Times, Spotify and Lyft are the first of many partnerships that will enable us to increasingly leverage and monetize the platform and our other technology investments. Through these investments and the best-of-class mobile and digital experience that Starbucks delivers, we believe that we are building an unassailable position that will only strengthen and become more relevant as today's increasingly mobile-first consumer economy evolves.", "But despite our industry-leading position in mobile and digital today, we are continuing to push the envelope and now have line of sight on the next-generation of features to excite and delight our customers and our partners. Mobile payment now accounts for 21% of all transactions in our U.S. company-owned stores, and although we only completed the rollout of Mobile Order & Pay across our system 7500 U.S. company-owned store portfolio in September, we were already operating at a run rate of over five million transactions per month. And that figure, believe it or not, is growing by the hour.", "We have seen the pattern of accelerated adoption of Mobile Order & Pay with each successive region and market we enter play out over and over again. And I'm pleased to report that we are seeing it again in terms of this pattern, accelerated adoption, repeat in the early days of our recent international launches of Mobile Order & Pay in both the U.K. and Canada.", "Membership in our fast growing and industry-leading My Starbucks Rewards program, our loyalty program, continues to grow, and we now have over 20 million members in countries around the world. And two weeks ago, we launched delivery in the Empire State Building to favorable customer and media response, and we'll be launching delivery in Seattle in conjunction with Postmates later this quarter.", "But the growth in incrementality you are seeing today is only the beginning of an exciting evolution of Starbucks' business that commercialization of our new proprietary technologies is enabling, and it all is made possible by the investments we have made and continue to make in our mobile, digital, and loyalty programs.", "As I was preparing for this call, I couldn't help but become a bit nostalgic as I reflected how gratifying this quarter and year has been. And now with a market cap poised to exceed $100 billion, how far we have come from that small coffee company in Seattle that had 125 stores at the time of our IPO in June of 1992. 23,000 stores in 68 countries around the world, close to 2,000 stores in China, over 2,000 stores in EMEA, and over a1000 stores each in Japan and Korea, and over 180,000 points of CPG distribution around the world.", "The deep authentic connection our customers have with the Starbucks brand and with our people, our values, and our culture and the universal appeal of the Starbucks experience, stunning financial performance coupled with unmatched groundbreaking innovation that is relevant to our customers and our people and so much on the horizon.", "Never in our 23 years as a public company has the Starbucks brand or our business been more relevant or been stronger. Nor have our aspirations and the opportunities that lie ahead of us. We remain humble and steadfast in our mission to build a great enduring company, and as managers and leaders to exceed the expectations of our customers and our partners.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Johnson", "Kevin R. Johnson - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to take a few minutes to provide more color on the quarter and share my perspective on our business as we enter fiscal year 2016. Then I'll turn the call over to Scott, for details on our financial performance and outlook for fiscal year 2016", "Howard highlighted a few key themes: Stellar operating and financial performance, our investments are paying off, and we have great confidence in our future. Since taking on the COO role in March, I've been personally focused on operationalizing the seven core strategies for growth we outlined at last December's Investor Day, allocating resources against those operating plans, and driving execution across the business.", "The investments we are making are aligned with those strategies, and they are working, giving us confidence going into fiscal year 2016 that we have line of sight to our next wave of initiatives and the business outcomes that will follow. Let's take a look at each business segment.", "Our fast-growing Americas segment continues to deliver industry-leading growth, posting 8% comp growth in Q4 with 9% comp growth in the U.S. Americas grew revenues 11% in Q4, fantastic operating performance for a business of its size, and it opened 612 net new stores over the past 12 months. Our beverage program, fueled by innovation such as our new Cold Brew and strong core beverage performance, drove six points of comp growth and delivered increased food attach. Sales of iced beverages, including Teavana Shaken Iced Teas, grew 20% year-on-year. And our limited-time offering line-up with the new and improved Pumpkin Spice Latte, Salted Caramel Latte, and Toasted Graham Latte performed well ahead of our initial expectations.", "Noteworthy is that in fiscal year 2015, Teavana branded, handcrafted tea beverages generated nearly $1 billion of sales through Starbucks stores in the U.S., up 12% over last year. And we will be bringing Teavana branded, handcrafted tea beverages to CAP and EMEA in fiscal year 2016.", "Food revenue grew 19% in the quarter, contributing three points of comp growth, including attach. Our breakfast sandwich platform, which has now doubled in size from just three years ago, is increasingly resonating with our customers, and our lunch program is accelerating. Our focus on creating new occasions enabled us to grow in every day part. The data is clear: Starbucks is increasingly becoming a food destination across multiple day parts.", "We have momentum going into holiday, officially starting for millions of customers in the U.S. and around the world this weekend, when Starbucks cups turn red and we celebrate the return of Chestnut Praline Latte, Eggnog and Gingerbread Latte, Peppermint Mocha and Caramel Brul\u00e9e Latte. We've leveraged last year's learnings in a reimagined in-store experience for holiday and created an experience that embraces food and beverage innovation, while leveraging all of our best assets, including digital, loyalty, card, mobile and our global store footprint. Our partners are excited and they are ready.", "This year, customers will find a new seasonal favorite beverage which builds upon the popularity of our Flat White and holiday beverages and the return of our holiday Dot Collection. We are expanding our dotcom gift shop to offer seamless online and offline shopping experiences. All the merchandise our customers see in our stores will now be available online.", "Our Gift Card program is a big part of holiday. You may recall that last year, one in seven Americans received a Starbucks Gift Card over the holidays, generating over $1.6 billion in card loads in our first quarter of fiscal year 2015. This year, we've reimagined our card mall, expanded the program to include all U.S. company operated stores, and we're introducing a limited offering of premium cards. We're also bringing back the opportunity for customers to win something that isn't for sale: Starbucks for Life. This program will be exclusive to our MSR members, where they will have opportunities to win this very special reward. Noteworthy is that total card loads in the U.S. and Canada, including reloads and activations, in fiscal year 2015 totaled $5.1 billion, up 19% year-on-year.", "Our China Asia-Pacific segment delivered comp growth of 6%, driven entirely by increased traffic, with revenue growing 110%, 18% excluding the impact of approximately $287 million from the ownership change in Starbucks Japan and negative impact of FX. The result is outstanding operating income leverage with 25% growth in the quarter. Building for the future, rapid store growth continues as we added a record 838 net new stores in fiscal year 2015.", "Our new class of company-operated stores in CAP are outperforming the prior class, generating record AUVs and profit, results that demonstrate the accelerating strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand across the region. We now have over 1,800 stores in 95 cities throughout China. Our brand has never been stronger and our connection to our customers has never been deeper. We continue to introduce innovative new food and beverage items into the market, Cold Brew being one example, and we're leveraging all of our physical, digital and loyalty assets to become an increasing relevant part of the daily routine for our rapidly growing customer base in China. And we now have over eight million MSR customers in China, giving confidence in our commitment to having 3,500 stores in China by the year 2019.", "Our traffic growth in China continues to outpace our CAP segment traffic growth overall, and we saw traffic comps in China accelerate throughout the quarter with continued strong momentum into October.", "As we head towards the 20th anniversary of Starbucks Japan in 2016, our brand has never been stronger. With our business in Japan delivering another solid quarter of comp sales growth. And now with full ownership, we are positioned to accelerate growth and to leverage all of our mobile and digital capabilities as never before.", "Noteworthy is that the company operated stores we acquired in Japan last year will be included in our global and CAP comp basis during Q1 fiscal year 2016.", "EMEA's Q4 results demonstrate the success of our continued efforts to improve the profitability of our company-owned store portfolio, while at the same time as we grow our license business. Excluding approximately $40 million of FX headwinds and the transfer of 41 stores from company-owned to licensed, EMEA revenues increased approximately 8% in Q4. In fact, every major EMEA market posted positive comps in Q4, with the U.K., France, and Germany posting particularly strong comp growth.", "Comparable store sales in EMEA grew 5% despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges in several markets in the region with a 3% increase in traffic, representing EMEA's 10 consecutive quarter of positive comp growth.", "Our EMEA licensed markets are continuing to perform exceptionally well, with Turkey and the Middle East in particular continuing to outperform, further supporting our license-focused growth strategy.", "By Q4, nearly 69% of our 2,362 EMEA stores were licensed, up from only 54% four years ago. And we intend to continue to grow our EMEA licensed-store portfolio. This strategy is working as EMEA delivered a full 37% increase in operating income over Q4 last year.", "Channel Development Q4 revenues grew 14% over last year to $457 million. Despite continued competitive pressures in at-home coffee categories. We are pleased with the strength of packaged coffee sales in the quarter, which combined with K-Cup sales were the primary drivers of Channel Development revenue growth.", "Our total K-Cup portfolio continues to gain share despite increased pricing pressure and additional new market entrants. In fact, Starbucks is now the share leader in both premium roast and ground and the entire K-Cup segment for the first quarter ever.", "Innovation has been key in establishing our leadership position in the K-Cup category, and we're excited for customers to experience the new hot cocoa K-Cup beverage platform that we recently launched with classic and salted caramel hot cocoa flavor profiles.", "We've also seen our Stars down-the-aisle loyalty program driving incremental purchases of roast and ground in fiscal year 2016, and we're expanding the Stars program to include select Starbucks K-Cup SKUs.", "Foodservice also had a strong Q4 with 8% revenue growth year-over-year. Our broad product offerings to the foodservice trade are becoming increasingly appealing as businesses continue to differentiate themselves by providing employees with premium amenities in the workplace.", "Internationally, we're seeing strong growth in the China Asia Pacific ready-to-drink sales. While this is a small part of our business today, it underscores the size of the opportunity presented by the strategic partnership we announced earlier this year with Tingyi. We also remain on track to launch ready-to-drink through grocery and convenience store channels in 10 Latin American markets with our long-term business partner, PepsiCo, in 2016.", "As Howard mentioned, Starbucks has a front row seat at the intersection of the physical and digital world like no other company. Data shows that My Starbucks Rewards customers spend three times as much as non-MSR customers. The Starbucks digital experience is a key enabler of the loyalty program that engages customers and provides us with digital feedback to constantly improve the experience and attract more customers. It is a virtuous cycle.", "The pace of digital innovation is accelerating. We completed the rollout of Mobile Order & Pay in all U.S. company-owned stores to an overwhelming customer and partner response. We launched the Mobile Order & Pay feature on our Android App and introduced additional functionality to provide real-time store-specific menu and inventory information.", "We improved pickup time accuracy, all designed to add convenience and improve our customer experience. We have begun deployment in 150 stores in the U.K. and more than 300 stores in Canada, while framing plans to continue rolling out Mobile Order & Pay in key markets around the globe. We launched the Starbucks mobile app, both the iOS and Android versions in France and Germany. We're on track to deploy in Poland, Czech Republic, and Kuwait this year.", "This quarter we've grown our active MSR customer base in the U.S. by 28% year-on-year, our active mobile users in the U.S. and Canada has grown 32% year-on-year. Mobile payments in October represented over 21% of U.S. tender.", "We're launching delivery pilots in New York City and Seattle. In the coming weeks, we will launch a rich digital music experience, both in-store and out of store, integrated in our mobile app through our partnership with Spotify. Our digital momentum is real, and the roadmap for the upcoming year is bold. I'm convinced that Starbucks is doing something very unique and very special.", "We operate a world-class bricks-and-mortar retail business with over 23,000 stores that is growing, and we are rapidly building a world-class consumer digital experience powered by a technology platform that complements and extends the scale of our brick-and-mortar business.", "In my 34 years in the technology industry, it is difficult to point to another instance where an in-store experience has been extended to a digital experience in such a seamless and elegant manner. Many others in the food and beverage industry are now trying to follow in our footsteps by building a mobile app. From what I have observed in the market, Starbucks has built something that is differentiated from all of the others. Where others are attempting to build a mobile app, Starbucks has built an end-to-end consumer digital platform anchored around loyalty. This platform enables us to deliver new features faster, create a more integrated experience, and personalize those experiences for the consumer. I believe this approach provides a significant differentiation from others who are struggling to replicate the success we have experienced.", "Q4 of 2015 is a reflection of the great work being done by our Starbucks partners around the world who are delivering innovation, driving operational excellence, and leveraging the scale, reach, and breadth of our capabilities and to continuously elevate the Starbucks experience. The accelerating momentum we experienced in Q4 and unqualified success of our long-term strategies for sustained, profitable growth has ideally positioned us for the future.", "I'll now hand the call over to Scott, to take you through the quarter and our outlook for fiscal year 2016. Scott?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Kevin and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks performance in Q4 reflected a continuation of the pattern of accelerating momentum we have seen with each successive quarter of fiscal 2015. Revenue and profit growth each finished at the high end of our Q4 estimates and each of our four reporting segments achieved operating margin in excess of 15% for the first time in our history. Once again, demonstrating the strength of the Starbucks brand and continued excellent execution by our partners across the globe.", "Starbucks' strong Q4 results were particularly meaningful as they were achieved despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, and both the increase and acceleration of our partner and digital investments, investments that link directly to and in many ways are driving the comp and profitability growth we are experiencing.", "Kevin has addressed much of Starbucks' consolidated Q4 performance, so I will only comment that our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 19.7% and non-GAAP operating margin was 20%, up nicely from Q3, but down 50 basis points from Q4 of last year, due to the impact of partner and digital investments and the change in ownership of Starbucks Japan, partially offset by sales and cost of goods sold leverage.", "Now on to the segments; revenue and operating income growth in the Americas continues to be very strong. In Q4, Americas' operating income increased 13% year-over-year to $840 million \u2013 $841 million on an 11% increase in revenues to $3.4 billion. And our operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 24.8%. Strong sales leverage resulting from a 9% increase in U.S. comps was the primary driver of the margin expansion, more than offsetting approximately 160 basis points of impact related to increased partner and digital investments in Q4.", "GAAP operating income in our CAP segment reached a record $130 million in Q4, a full 25% increase over the prior year. GAAP operating margin declined to 19.9% from 33.5%, primarily due to the impact of the ownership change in Starbucks Japan. Excluding the 15.5 percentage points of financial impact from the ownership change in Starbucks Japan, CAP's operating margin increased by 190 basis points, driven primarily by operating savings in the region.", "EMEA results in Q4 were particularly strong, once again demonstrating increasing momentum in the business and continued progress against our plan to significantly improve segment profitability over time. EMEA achieved record operating income for the quarter, and when excluding unfavorable FX impact of nearly $5 million, EMEA operating income increased by almost 50% year-over-year to $58 million.", "And EMEA's Q4 operating margin of 17.2% exceeded expectations and marked the segment's fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit operating margin. EMEA's 510 basis point improvement in operating margin in Q4 over the prior year was driven primarily by sales leverage, including the impact of our ongoing portfolio shift to more licensed stores and gains on the sales of certain assets.", "Channel Development grew operating income of 15% over the prior year in Q4 to $197 million, also a quarterly record for the segment. Operating margin totaled 43.2%, a 20 basis point increase over the same quarter last year, reflecting a significant increase in income from our North America coffee partnership with PepsiCo and improved cost of goods sold efficiency, primarily offset by higher coffee costs and marketing costs.", "Before I wrap up Q4 and move on to a brief recap of our full-year fiscal 2015 results, I would like to note for Q4 comparison purposes two non-GAAP adjustments we made in addition to the adjustments we made related to our acquisition of Starbucks Japan.", "First, as I previously shared, we refinanced $550 million of higher-rate debt in Q4 and incurred a charge of approximately $61 million, primarily related to an early redemption premium.", "Second, our effective tax rate for Q4 2015 reflects an incremental tax benefit related to certain additional domestic manufacturing deductions to be claimed in our U.S. consolidated tax returns. These deductions are retroactive to fiscal-year 2010 and lowered our tax rate for Q4 of 2015 by 7.3% relative to Q4 of 2014, resulting in a GAAP effective tax rate of 27.2% for the quarter.", "Starbucks delivered excellent operating performance and financial results for the full fiscal year 2015. In addition to record revenue and operating income, we also drove operating margin expansion of 10 basis points on a GAAP basis and 50 basis points on a non-GAAP basis, both ahead of our initial margin guidance provided in Q4 of 2014.", "Excluding 90 basis points of impact from the change of ownership in Starbucks Japan, our operating margin once again expanded by over 100 basis points in 2015, driven by sales leverage, including significant leverage in cost of goods sold, reflecting the ongoing success of our efforts to drive efficiency in this critical area.", "In fiscal-year 2015, each of our reporting segments achieved record operating income. In terms of operating margin, our Americas segment drove margin expansion of 80 basis points for the year to 24.2%, driven by strong sales leverage and despite a 90 basis point impact from increased partner investments. China/Asia-Pacific delivered a 20.9% margin for the year, significantly above our initial guidance for a high-teens operating margin in CAP that we provided on last year's Q4 earnings call.", "EMEA was a standout, finishing the year with a remarkable 13.8% margin, representing a full 460 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year and eclipsing our previous goal of reaching mid-teens operating margin by 2018. And Channel Development delivered a 37.8% operating margin for the year, a 180 basis point increase over last year, and representing our third straight year for margin expansion in excess of 100 basis points.", "Finally, it is important that I qualify the impact of FX in our financials. FX negatively impacted both Starbucks' revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth by roughly 3 percentage points in Q4 and 2 percentage points for the full year. The record operating and financial results we delivered in fiscal 2015 also drove record cash generation, providing the capital we need to reinvest in our business and increase the cash we return to our shareholders. In fiscal 2015, we returned a record $2.4 billion of cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks, up over 50% from 2014 levels. And today, we announced that our board has approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share.", "As you know, Starbucks' performance and profitability has been consistently strong over the last several years. Nonetheless, 2015 was an important, if not pivotal, year for us financially and operationally. We delivered record operating and financial results, returned record cash to our shareholders, and importantly, we funded several very significant new investment initiatives. And I'm pleased to report that these initiatives are already producing outsized returns for our shareholders. I'd like to share a few metrics to illustrate this point.", "After adjusting to reflect the change in ownership of Starbucks Japan, our return on invested capital increased over 200 basis points in 2015. While still only in their early days, the investments we have made in Mobile Order & Pay and in areas such as improved MSR one-to-one marketing are already delivering returns well in excess of our overall company average. Partner attrition in our U.S. stores has declined and, as Howard mentioned, we gained a full three points in the past month, bringing our delta to 18 points versus the industry on this critical metric. And the data is clear that our stores with the lowest attrition generate comps that are above our company average.", "Finally, and perhaps most importantly, our comp growth in the U.S. clearly illustrates how our investments are timed to performance. In Q4 of last year, we delivered five points of comp growth with one point of traffic growth in the U.S. During 2015, our comps and traffic accelerated sequentially every quarter to 9% and 4%, respectively, in lockstep with the ramp of our investments. The strength and momentum we saw throughout 2015 and are seeing as we enter 2016 gives us the confidence we need to increase the speed and size of our investments in order to continue strengthening and expanding the foundation of our increasingly global business.", "Importantly, in fiscal 2016, we will be taking the learnings from the investments we are making in our partners in the U.S. to major markets around the world. This next wave of partner investment will include wage and benefit increases and even housing benefits in some countries. And following on the success of the investments we are making in our mobile, digital and payments initiatives in the U.S., in 2016, we will be accelerating these investments, both domestically and in our largest international markets. With this as background, I'll now turn to our relevant targets for 2016.", "Consistent with our long-term goals, we expect 10% or greater revenue growth on a 52-week basis with the 53rd week adding approximately two points to this growth. Importantly, and for the first time in many years, given the momentum we are seeing in our business, we are expecting 2016 global comp growth to be somewhat above our long-term mid-single-digit guidance range. Our consolidated operating margin will increase slightly from 2015 on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases, reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and business investments.", "We expect to see our operating margin in the Americas increase moderately above 2015, reflecting strong sales and COGS leverage, offset by the impact of our investments. And we expect to see flat to slightly down operating margins in CAP from 2015 levels as increasing sales levels in China, Japan and across the region is offset by the last bit of impact from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan and the continuing impact of negative FX headwinds. Noteworthy is that our projected operating margin of approximately 20% in CAP is above our initial expectations for year two when we close the Japan acquisition. And we remain bullish on the opportunity for future long-term margin expansion in CAP.", "Q1 CAP margin is expected to be lower by several points than Q1 of 2015, primarily due to lapping the impact of the change in our ownership of Starbucks Japan and the negative impact of FX. Also given the complexity of modeling the impact of the ownership change in Japan, I'd like to provide additional color around our CAP revenue expectation for 2016.", "Overall, in FY 2016, we expect CAP comps to land in the mid-single digits, including the impact of adding over 1,000 stores in Japan into the calculation. And projected revenue growth in CAP will be in the mid-teens, reflecting excellent growth in all of our major markets and a small benefit from the change in Japan ownership, partially offset by ongoing FX headwinds.", "We expect our operating margin in EMEA to approach 15% for the year, as we continue to realize the benefits of increased momentum in key markets, strong execution by the team, and the ongoing business model shift from company-owned to licensed stores. And sales leverage will drive moderate margin expansion in our Channel Development segment, though less than the very strong 180 basis point expansion we saw in 2015.", "As a result of both strong overall revenue growth and margin expansion, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $1.84 to $1.86 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.87 to $1.89, including the 53rd week we will report on in the fourth quarter of 2016.", "A few specifics about our EPS guidance; the 53 week adds approximately $0.06 to our 2016 EPS estimate. Our expectations of comp growth being somewhat above mid-single digits is factored in to our 2016 EPS estimate. We expect the year-over-year increase in global partner and digital investments in 2016 will be between $100 million and $125 million, impacting our EPS growth rate by approximately 3 points.", "Our total global investment in these areas in 2016 will land between $250 million and $275 million, compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. The majority of the 2016 initiatives will be in the U.S., but will also include global investments in certain increased partner benefits, digital and technology investments, and G&A costs.", "FX is expected to impact revenue growth by 1 percentage point and EPS growth by 2 percentage points. Commodities impact is slightly favorable for the year, now with over 90% of our 2016 coffee costs locked. And finally, our effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 34% and 35%.", "Given all these inputs, when adjusting our 2016 non-GAAP EPS range for the extra week by subtracting the $0.06, our growth rate versus 2015 non-GAAP EPS of $1.58, will be at or slightly above 15%.", "For Q1, 2016 we are targeting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.43 to $0.44 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 to $0.45, representing a lower growth rate than the full year as significant FX headwinds in Q1 of 2016 will impact non-GAAP EPS growth by four full points.", "Also, Q1 growth will be lower as we started implementing the vast majority of our 2015 partner and digital investments in earnest in Q2 of last year. Given our Q1, 2016 growth rate, we expect non-GAAP EPS growth in the remaining three quarters of 2016 to be in the middle of our long-term guidance range.", "Contributing to our revenue growth in fiscal 2016 will be the addition of approximately 1,800 net new stores globally. In 2016, 70% of our net new stores will be outside of the U.S. with the entire Americas segment accounting for a total of 700 stores, split roughly evenly between company-owned and licensed.", "Our China/Asia Pacific segment will drive roughly half of our new store growth with 900 net new stores, two-thirds of which will be licensed. And our EMEA segment is targeting 200 net new stores in fiscal 2016, virtually all of which will be licensed. Finally, capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion.", "2015 was another excellent year of financial performance for Starbucks as demonstrated by record results and significant increases in total shareholder return, return on invested capital, and cash returned to shareholders. In 2016, Starbucks will deliver approximately $21 billion in revenue, operate close to 25,000 stores, and generate an operating margin approaching 20%. And despite the scale and scope of our company, we will also deliver, once again, double-digit revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS growth of at least 15%, when excluding the set impact from the 53rd week, consistent with our long-term targets. The growth we are experiencing and returns we are delivering are made possible by the investments we are making in our people and in our business and the dedication and hard work of our partners around the world, who now deliver an elevated Starbucks experience nearly 80 million times every week.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Great. Thank you. The question might be a little bit obvious, but Howard, in the last conference call, and I think very rightly, you told us not to expect mid-single-digit comps and you told us certainly not to model more than mid-single-digit comps. So, in terms of kind of expressing that, you expect to have somewhat above mid-single-digit comps for fiscal 2016. I mean the question has to be asked, what specifically changed maybe relative to how you thought three months ago when you told us not to think about anything above mid-single-digit comps? And is it Mobile Order & Pay that's really getting the significant traction in the U.S. that's giving you the confidence to do so well on extremely difficult comparisons or is it other factors that you'd like to discuss?", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I certainly was \u2013 I was expecting that call, John, but not right out of the gate. So let's just kind of walk through this together. Throughout the calendar and fiscal year, we saw an acceleration of traffic and comp store sales. And I think if you go back a year ago, we were at 5% and 1%. And if you look at 9% and 4% in the U.S. and what we've done sequentially throughout the year and you couple that with the inherent momentum and attachment that we're seeing from mobile payment, Mobile Order & Pay, and specifically the integration, as Kevin talked about, and the attachment of loyalty, we have enough visibility in the business to be transparent with you that we believe that we're going to see some incrementality in our overall comp.", "And I think just like I've said in the years past, we want to be very straightforward and try and under promise and over deliver. I think we're at the inverse here, and we just feel that it's important to be straightforward and tell you that we think our comps, although it's really an anomaly in this market, is going to be somewhat greater than what we've had this calendar year and fiscal 2015. I would not jump to conclusion and say it's going to be significantly greater. But we have enough visibility and I think significant attachment and response from our customers based on in-store execution, the investments we've made in our partners, as Scott has really articulated, has had a significant effect on our relationship with our customers and all of these things are laddering up to a performance.", "I mean, when we saw the quarter head towards 9% comps in the U.S., given where all of U.S. retail is, where the economy is, where bricks and mortar has gone, the change in \u2013 seismic change in consumer behavior and everyone else in our peer group, not only is it a stunning number, but it's a number that does not exist anywhere in the world at our scale, at our complexity. And we think we're going to do better than the mid-single-digit guidance that we've given you the last few years, and we thought it was responsible to share that with you.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And if I'm still on, Howard, it's certainly striking to hear your approach to labor in fiscal 2016 in this tightening economy, and maybe juxtapose that a little bit with Starbucks' experience maybe in the late 1990s and 2006, 2007 where you did participate in very tight labor markets. So, is it to some extent lesson learned from your perspective of just the importance of having the right people and compensating them and making sure that turnover is staying low, or how would you describe this current labor market relative to other tightening and expensive labor markets that Starbucks has seen in the past?", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think the equity of the Starbucks brand throughout our public life has been defined by the culture and values and guiding principles. I said from day one that we are in the experience business, and our brand is defined by the people who wear the green apron. The entire DNA of the company goes back to equity in the form of stock options, comprehensive health insurance, 25 years ahead of the Affordable Care Act, and this year alone groundbreaking benefit of college achievement of providing all of our people with a four-year education.", "So, I think what we've seen is that other companies are reacting and playing catch-up to legislation, where we have always been ahead of it, and the tightening of the labor market is not something that we want to deal with or use as an excuse, just like we don't want to talk about weather.", "And so, we strongly believe that the investments we've made ahead of the curve on legislation in terms of labor and the benefits that we have provided for many, many years is an intrinsic part of the Starbucks experience, and the brand affinity, the loyalty, and all the things that we're doing are linked directly to the investments we've made in our partners. And I think, as Scott said, we can give you even more specifics that demonstrate that the return on investment of these benefits is dramatically affecting return on investment of new stores. You saw that in the $1.4 million first-year stores, the return on investment on comp store sales, and the incrementality.", "There's no one on the planet doing 4% traffic at our scale, especially when you consider that we have self-cannibalized, I don't know what the percentage is, probably 20%, 30% 40% of our store base this year alone, and no effect. We are driving incrementality in all day parts, and our people in many ways are responsible for it and we want to invest in them and with them. And I think the performance just shows the result.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you (52:56) so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein.", "Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a little bit more about digital and it's sort of a two-part question. One is, obviously Mobile Order & Pay extremely successful and I think we see that in the fact that you're rolling out so quickly elsewhere. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the relative impact on traffic versus ticket. Obviously, both numbers very impressive, but even a little bit more out of ticket that I might have expected. So that's part one.", "And part two is, maybe you could talk about further partnerships, so you talked about Spotify and Lyft and the New York Times. Could you share your plans for expansion there and when we might expect this to be maybe even a material contributor to operating results from a financial perspective that you actually call out separately? Thank you.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, thanks. Let's have Adam comment on Mobile Order & Pay first, and then we'll take the other two parts of your question.", "Adam B. Brotman - Chief Digital Officer, Executive Vice President", "Hi, Sara. This is Adam. On Mobile Order & Pay, a couple things to mention. First of all, before we get into specifics on ticket and transactions, it's worth reiterating that Mobile Order & Pay is part of a broader platform that includes card, loyalty, mobile payment, digital engagement, and now mobile ordering. And we're about to add delivery and music. So, no other consumer retailer has put together a platform like this, and Mobile Order & Pay is proving out what we thought, which is that when you get the flywheel effect of such a successful platform, you see the results that you see from Mobile Order & Pay.", "Now specifically to your question, we're seeing incremental transactions from Mobile Order & Pay, particularly in our busiest stores. We're pleased with the results across all the tiers of our stores. You know, ticket right now is holding steady and is doing quite well consistent with our other MSR ticket, and we haven't even added the feature of suggested selling and suggested pairing, which we're going to do in the first half of the year. So, we expect to see that increase on top of the incremental transactions that we're seeing.", "Kevin R. Johnson - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, and Sara, this is Kevin. I'll just add to Adam's comments about what's driving our comps. I think there's three key things. Number one, Howard mentioned is the investments we've made in our partners and the fact that we've reduced attrition is allowing our partners in store to better connect with our customers, and we know that that yields better outcomes in terms of comp growth. And so that's number one.", "Number two is our investment in food and beverage innovation. In fact, if you look at the comps, three points of our comp growth came from food. Our breakfast sandwich business has doubled in the past three years. Lunch is accelerating. We now have evenings program deployed in 100 stores, so it's early days on evenings, but we've seen growth in every day part as a result.", "On the beverage side, that accounted for 6% \u2013 six points of comp growth. And so innovation certainly around things like Cold Brew contributed to it, and very good results with our iced beverages including the Teavana Shaken Iced Teas, which grew 20% year-on-year. So in addition to the investment in partners, it's the investment in food and beverage innovation, and then finally is the investment in digital and loyalty. So in fact, we know that MSR customers on average spend three times as much as non-MSR customers, and we've grown the number of active MSR customers by 28% year-on-year. So the investments we're making in our partners, food and beverage innovation and digital and loyalty are key drivers.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "There was one question about partnerships, future partners. Matt, do you want to take that?", "Matthew Ryan - Global Chief Strategy Officer", "Sure. It's Matt Ryan. We have only just begun with our partnership business regarding loyalty. And while we've announced three specific deals, there are many more to come. We are in the process of building capability to offer Stars everywhere. That is the opportunity for customers to essentially earn Stars at a lot of different places and take them back to Starbucks. That is going to be a lever in our business in the future and that has not yet impacted our business but will. In addition, as we negotiate those deals, we are going to have additional benefits to both our customers and our partners, which will accrue back to us in the form of loyalty and deepened engagement. So we're very, very bullish on that. We don't have specific announcements today, but stay tuned.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Keith Siegner from UBS.", "Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you. Howard, in the past couple of years, you have talked about the seismic shift in the retail landscape and how you were going to strategize against that. If you think about the success of the Mobile Order & Pay, this whole platform that it's integrated into, delivery and inevitability, next-gen features you said are already in sight. When you think about that real estate, that physical asset base that you've talked about and its role in servicing that relationship; does this change or could this change? Can you exploit some of that relationship and come up with a new or different way to even further deepen that relationship with consumers? How do you think about that? Thanks.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You know, I think \u2013 as you all know, I think two years ago or so, we shared with you that we had begun to witness and get quite concerned about a downturn in pedestrian traffic on Main Street and certainly a downturn in traffic in malls. And I think if you look at the retailers that are succeeding, I'm not talking about people in our core business but all retailers anywhere in the world, it has to be an experiential, emotional experience where the retail experience is really exceeding the expectation of the customer. And so we went back to work on that and I think we also believe very strongly that we had to seamlessly integrate the Starbucks experience with all things mobile. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are living in a mobile-first global economy and we're witnessing that kind of change.", "With regard to the physical shape, size, and what we do in our stores, I think we do believe, and I can't give too much away here, that we are in a position where we're in every single or almost every single community in America and almost, you can almost make that statement, in the world, and as a result of that, we're both intercepting and driving traffic into our stores. And we certainly have one of the world's strongest real estate portfolios in terms of where those stores are located. So we are, I think, asking ourselves the very important question, what else can we do in our stores? And I think the operative issue here is relevancy. We have become an extremely relevant brand.", "And, as Kevin just outlined, three, four years ago, all the day parts that we're now engaged in, we did not have relevancy, we didn't have the right product. And we're, certainly, now looking at the physical space, what it is we're selling. And I'll share something else with you. It's because of the amount of traffic we have, the millions of people and the fact that the core customer is a Millennial customer, the most important consumer in the world today, we have many, many companies who want to partner with us and integrate their products or services into the Starbucks Experience and specifically, certainly they want to do that in terms of what we're doing in terms of mobile technology. So these are early days of us answering that question, but I think you did hit a nerve here by saying that Starbucks has a physical asset almost second to none and when you combine that with what we've been able to do in leveraging that with a seamless digital mobile experience, we're in a very unique position to win.", "And, I would say, we're as hungry today as we were two years ago when we recognized the problem and we're challenged by it. We certainly feel we have overcome it and we're winning, but we're hungrier today to make sure that the separation we create in the marketplace between us and everyone else gets wider.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair.", "Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to touch on the labor investment that you've made in the U.S. I think you talked about making more of an investment globally as well. Can you dimensionalize kind of the order of magnitude of the investments, both in the U.S. that you've already done and maybe ongoing investment into 2016 both in the U.S. and overseas?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, thanks, Sharon. It's Scott. So the total amount, as I mentioned, is between $250 million and $275 million. The vast majority of that, again, will be in the U.S. I think the important part is there is some amount that will happen out in the regions, much smaller dollars, but that includes not only partner investments which is wage and benefit, but it includes an acceleration of some things we want to do digitally around mobile, around loyalty, and around platforms in general. So I think the way to think about it is vast majority in the U.S., a bit in the other regions. And as we go through the year, if those numbers become significant, we'll give you an idea of how they landed by segment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets.", "David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi. Thanks. What customer and partner feedback are you getting on Mobile Order & Pay so far, and in what ways do you think you can improve the app or adjust operations to make the experience even better? And just separately, bigger picture, I think you said 21% of orders were mobile payment to some degree. It might be striking to you internally as an opportunity that four out of five orders are not using the benefits of mobile pay or mobile order. Are you thinking about ways that you can further drive penetration to get them into this digital ecosystem that you have? Thanks.", "Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region", "Thanks, David. It's Cliff here. It has been incredible to see the adoption by customers across the country, and with each wave that we've launched, the ramp rate has been quicker for adoption. I think what is most exciting is our highest volume stores are the ones that are seeing the biggest share come from mobile orders, and what is happening with that is it increases capacity in the store itself. So we're seeing two wins on this. We're seeing the adoption of mobile orders, and we're seeing increased capacity in the core stores. So every part of the country is now live, and we are seeing activity from mobile orders in every part of the country. I could speak briefly to Canada where that adoption focused in Toronto has mirrored what we've seen in the U.S., and it just bodes really well for the future.", "Adam, do you want to talk about the increased offer?", "Adam B. Brotman - Chief Digital Officer, Executive Vice President", "Yeah, thanks, Cliff. This is Adam. David, just to build on what Cliff said in terms of some of our busiest stores particularly in either hospitals or downtown locations, let me give you some examples of that. Yesterday, World Financial Center in New York City did 150 mobile orders for over 10% of their overall transactions. Duke Energy Center in Charlotte, North Carolina has been doing incredible with Mobile Order & Pay. They did over 234 mobile orders yesterday for 20% of their transaction. Cleveland Clinic in a busy hospital where the convenience of when you're on break and you don't have a lot of time and you want to just get your mobile order and get out, incremental occasions being driven there 269 mobile orders for 11% of their transactions.", "So these are in on our busiest tier. It gives you an example of how pleased our customers and stores are with Mobile Order & Pay. Customers are responding incredibly well. We're seeing conversion rates from trial like we've never seen before. We are seeing some of the best customer satisfaction scores for Mobile Order & Pay, particularly around customer connection, which is a great indicator of future visits. So we're really happy with what's going on there. And in terms of what are we going to do to continue to improve it and how are we going to get even better adoption, that's absolutely in our plan. First of all, we're constantly improving the estimated pick-up time algorithm.", "Same with store inventory, we've enhanced our ability to display accurate store level menu and inventory availability and we're chockfull of great new features that are coming for Mobile Order & Pay including the ability, like I mentioned earlier, for suggested selling which should drive not only customer satisfaction but also bigger ticket. You're going to see the ability to redeem your loyalty rewards, and favorite stores and favorite orders. So that's just the beginning of what we're going to do to improve not only adoption but the experience.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And I've had to say one thing which I think is important. We've always viewed ourselves as merchants, and when we think about the digital experience and the mobile experience with regard to mobile payment and Mobile Order & Pay, the most important thing that we try to consider is the customer experience and as merchants what can we do to surprise and delight the customer so that the mobile experience and the digital experience is not something that's dilutive but actually something that is accretive.", "And I think as Kevin said in his remarks, I think all those players that are now trying to get into this business, what I notice is that it's really \u2013 they're in a utility business. They're in a commodity digital experience. That is not who we have been as a retailer, and that's not who we're going to be as a digital purveyor of the Starbucks Experience.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much. I thought I'd maybe go in slightly different direction. I wanted to just ask about CAP and the comps being 6%. They had been stronger in prior quarters, traffic had been stronger. So I'm just wondering what that deceleration was, where it came from? You talked about China being strong. So I wasn't sure if it was maybe ex-China. Maybe you can put a little more color around what is going on in China since that seems to be a controversial area now.", "John Winchester Culver - Group President-China & Asia Pacific", "Yeah. John, let me \u2013 this is John \u2013 let me just talk a little bit about China and what we're seeing in China. And first, let me just be very clear that our business in China and across CAP remains very, very strong. You look at the momentum that we've been able to build. We've seen no systemic slowdown in our business in China. As we discussed on the call, our performance in terms of comp in China accelerated above the total region. And when you look at the comp breakdown, not only in China but then also across the region, this is all being driven by transactions which is phenomenal. It means that we're attracting more new customers into our stores every day as well as, at the same time, continuing to build frequency with our existing customers.", "In addition, what we saw during the quarter was that comps actually accelerated month to month. And in China, we see that comps are continuing to accelerate into the month of October, which is great news for us. Just let me touch on China because I know there's a lot of questions out there right now. Today, we operate 1,800 stores across 95 cities, and when you think back to two years ago, we had a 1,500 store target in China by the end of 2015. We are significantly ahead of that 1,500 store target with over 1,800 stores. In the quarter, we opened 135 new stores in China. That's 1.5 stores per day, which is actually ahead of the 1.2 stores that we average for the entire fiscal year of 2015.", "And when you look at the new stores that we're opening in China, we have the best age class performance in our new stores since 2012. And when you break down the total growth across CAP and really across China, 75% of our revenue growth is being driven by new stores, 25% is being driven by comp, and what we continue to do is focus on investing ahead of the curve as it relates to our people, the digital landscape, IT, store development, supply chain, and continuing to elevate our coffee position in the marketplace. So, again, we're just very optimistic about the opportunity that CAP presents and more specifically what China presents.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird.", "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations to all of you for delivering great results. My question, Scott, is two-fold. First, on the investments that you're making, or the incremental investments you're making into business, are those structural in nature, meaning they'll continue beyond 2016, or are there any one-time in nature? And then I guess the second part of my question is just the flow-through to the margins that you're anticipating in 2016 on the comps you're expecting, looks a little low on the surface. So is there anything going on outside of some of the factors you mentioned that would prevent the flow-through down to the bottom line in 2016?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, David. On the first part of your question, I think what we've done in 2015 and heading into 2016 is actually accelerate the investments as we've moved through time. So we had a number as we started the year in 2015, and each quarter we actually leaned in a little bit more. And we're doing that again in 2016. And I think there may be some of that that continues as we head into 2017, but obviously as we've changed our plans as we move through 2015, we'll update you as we get into 2017. So I do think we're in an accelerated investment mode now. At some point, that will tail off. But I think the best way for you to think about it is as we move through time, we'll let you know. When we see opportunities to accelerate given what's happening on the top line, we will lean in. We will spend more. We won't hesitate to do what the right thing is. And so, I think the best thing for you to do is just sort of track with us as we go through time. I feel good about what we have for 2016. As we get through the year, we'll talk about 2017.", "On flow-through, I would say part of the flow-through that you're mentioning is driven by exactly what I'm talking about. So we are definitely investing ahead of the curve. So there's a little bit of advanced and accelerated investment that's having some impact on margin.", "But I just want to go back to the comments I made on the call that are really important. A lot of what you're seeing for the full year on margin and EPS growth guidance is really a result of what's happening in that first quarter, driven by significant FX impact which impacts top line and bottom line and margin. And driven by the fact that we didn't really start our partner investments until January of last year. So that math is impacting the whole year. As you get through to the rest of the year, you kind of come back up into the middle of our range on a non-GAAP basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Congratulations on the quarter. I want to ask actually a question about food, which is 3% of comp growth instead of 2% of comp growth on a larger base, lunch is accelerating. Certainly some data points there to feel good about. As it's become a bigger part of the business, kind of outside of the breakfast day part, I'm curious what you're learning in terms of merchandising, products that people are using, grab and go versus things in the case, and just what you've learned so far that can help you continue to grow and build momentum in that part of the day?", "Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region", "Thanks, Karen. It's Cliff. We're really pleased with what we're seeing with food and food across the day parts. The strength of breakfast sandwiches, as Kevin mentioned earlier, we've seen that business double over the last three years. And that is quite significant for us. We're also now into testing lunch, and we're seeing both great reaction from the customers around the offering, Bistro Boxes, paninis, and the enhancement of our sandwich range. And evenings is \u2013 it's 100 stores now, and we're going to open several hundred more during the year with the evenings program, and that is giving us a day part where not only is the wine beer and our standard beverages but there is also this opportunity for sharing plates.", "So that is \u2013 so the day parts we're excited about, we're able to offer to customers. At the same time, we are increasing the introduction of what we're calling, Wall of Chill, which is our grab and go food presentation, which in high volume stores certainly in the urban locations not only do people buy products for breakfast, but they also often buy something to take with them like the Bistro Box. So portability is important. Food is growing both in our store and through the drive-thru lanes. And with what Adam was talking about on Mobile Order & Pay, our ability to offer people at a store level the food range that that store has and, over time, a much more dynamic suggestive sell plus responding to the in-stock position, all of those things bode really well.", "We've seen food grow through that 3% comp to 20% of the mix in U.S. stores, and we see that increasing over time to the mid-20%s, but obviously beverage will still drive it. And we'll just keep investing, keep learning, and keep growing it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Charles from Cowen & Co.", "Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you. Adam, with Mobile Order & Pay and delivery coming soon and the marketing opportunities these have, do you view straight-up mobile payment as something ultimately become obsolete or it still have its place given the robust customer data you receive from it as well as the convenience?", "Adam B. Brotman - Chief Digital Officer, Executive Vice President", "I think, Andrew \u2013 this is Adam. No, mobile payment is not going to become obsolete. Although mobile ordering is a form of mobile payment and we are going to see a significant number of transactions morph over. But it's really the spectrum of offering customers what they want. If they want the convenience of mobile payment, mobile loyalty engagement, we're going to continue to offer that and innovate on that. And as mobile ordering becomes more and more powerful and more and more prevalent, you're going to see some of that shift over. I will tell you that we saw record mobile payment last week, and as Kevin and Howard mentioned, over 21% of our transactions are still mobile payment, and it's going strong in terms of both mobile payment and now mobile ordering", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.", "Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much. Just had follow up questions on, I guess, China, Asia-Pacific region. Maybe just a two-part question.", "One, in terms of the unit potential, I know you're talking about accelerating that. I'm just wondering it looks like this year you're talking about 900 units, up slightly from I think you guided last year to 850 units. So I'm wondering what's the gating faster that maybe faster growth, I guess it's primarily in China, whether it's people or real estate? It doesn't seem like it's demand. And I'm sensitive to asking this because I know about prior concerns of growing too fast. But the first part of the question was just on what's the gating factor.", "And the other piece was just broadly around China just as you build that business and one day it will be the biggest business outside of the U.S. Can you just talk about the success you're seeing and shifting customers whether it's pushing them from p.m. to a.m. or shifting them from tea to coffee, just how you're converting those customers into more of the traditional Starbucks customer? Thanks.", "John Winchester Culver - Group President-China & Asia Pacific", "Hi, Jeff. This is John. Thanks for the question. First, in terms of the growth rate around stores, we'll open approximately 900 stores across China next year. And we're well on our way to delivering the 3,400 or 3,500 store target by 2019.", "We continue to be very disciplined in how we're looking at real estate, how we're building the stores, and, more importantly, how we're creating that experience for our customers and really taking the long-term view on that. When you look at the success of the portfolio, particularly this past year, but more importantly as well in year's prior, the portfolio continues to perform very strong. And we continue to lay the tracks around the infrastructure so that we can continue to accelerate in the future new store growth. So again, we remain very optimistic about that. We continue to focus on people and bringing in the right people, training our partners, and giving them the tools that they need in order to be successful.", "In terms of the customers and shifting them, what we see is that the majority of our business continues to be in the afternoon and evenings in China. But more and more we're seeing that morning ritual come into play. We have some investments in the business this year in the plan around food and building out the capability around food and particularly the morning day part.", "In addition, we see digital as a key component in helping to shift customers from that afternoon and evening day part into the morning. And we're laying the tracks on that now. So, again, we're taking the long-term view on China. We want to build our business the right way. We have a very strong brand and great experience that we're providing our customers there", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "John, can you just speak to what we're doing in January on the family partner forum and what we've done in the past and why that's been so important?", "John Winchester Culver - Group President-China & Asia Pacific", "Yeah, so one of the things that we've talked about over the course of the last couple years is partner family forums in China. And the significant role that the family plays in helping their children select where they want to work and the type of companies they want to work for.", "Three years ago, we held our very first partner family forum in Beijing, followed by one in Shanghai, and then another, a third one, in Guangzhou. In January, we're going to do our fourth family forum in Chengdu and when you think of these family forums, think of about 2,000 people, our partners as well as their mothers and fathers, their children, if they have children, coming to this and really seeing what Starbucks is and who we are as a company around the values we have, the opportunities that we're going to give them to grow, and really no other company is able to create this type of experience.", "And that's why, over the last several years, we've been the employer of choice in China, and we've been able to attract top talent. So we're continuing to make these investments, and we're continuing to be very optimistic about our future in China. But we want to do it the right way.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karen Short from Deutsche Bank.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask a couple of questions about guidance. I guess, though, the first is within your comp guidance, can you maybe just kind of go into more detail on the different components, food, tea, innovation, Mobile Order & Pay? And then the second question I had is just, I guess your fiscal 2016 guidance for Americas calls for moderate margin expansion, which is consistent with your language on fiscal 2015 margin guidance, and yet obviously, margins were up 80 basis points. So I guess any color on what your definition is of moderate because you definitely seem more confident on your ability to drive comp, so maybe wondering if you're being conservative. Thanks.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks for the question. On the first part, I think comp growth next year in the U.S. will look a lot like it looked this year. So in other words, strong growth from food probably in that two-point, maybe three-point range. It's important to point out this is the first time we've ever had three points in food, so the momentum is continuing. I would expect to see limited time offerings in innovation, as Kevin talked about, with things like Cold Brew. There's lots of things in the pipeline that will continue to drive a point or two point of comp there.", "And then, importantly, the core of what's driving our comp today is all of our regular platform, so espresso, iced beverages, just significant growth in those things that we've been doing all along and we just continue to do them better. So I think the comp breakdown, think of it as very similar to what we did both in the quarter and the year. And then, yeah, I expect Americas comp expansion to be in the range of what you saw this year. So we said moderate. That was 80 basis points, and I think that, that's in the range of what we'll see as we look forward for 2016.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities.", "Matthew James DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you. I also have a question on a little bit of the guidance there with the margin outlook for the U.S. It also seems a little conservative if I look at where coffee costs have gone. I wonder if you can just give us an update of what you've locked in. I know the last time you talked, I think you said it was 80% locked in. I'm just curious if the majority of what we're seeing in the commodity market coming down now, how that directionally relates to your coffee if that's more so a multiple-year progress of you being able to realize that benefit. And in addition, also I just wanted to make sure I understood the partner investments that you've made. How much has that helped you to maybe have a less of a hit from the structural wage inflation coming down the pipe when the calendar turns to January? How much are you already fronting?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Matt. It's Scott. As it relates to coffee costs, the first thing that I'll just remind everyone is coffee in our retail business continues to be a decreasing part of overall COGS. So just keep that in mind as we grow, the movement in coffee prices really impacts channel development more than it does the retail businesses. With that said, we expect coffee costs to be a little bit favorable as we look forward into 2016. And I think this was inherent in your question, Matt.", "If you go back a couple of years, you'll recall that in 2014, coffee prices spiked significantly. They spent a good portion of the year above $1.90. They went above $2. Heading into that spike, we were quite long in our coffee inventory, and so we didn't buy much coffee at those prices. And so when coffee came down for 2015, we started buying. And so, if you were to take a look at the spot rate impacting 2015, we were much lower than that spot rate because of our coffee buying practices. So as you roll over into 2016, the delta in the spot rate doesn't impact us as much because we didn't pay as much as the market did in 2014. So that's what's happening is we're smoothing out those costs, aborting the spikes that we had in 2014 and our 2015 P&L, and that's rolling into some favorability in 2016 and I think some favorability as we head into 2017, depending on what the market does. So I think being patient there definitely paid off for us.", "So, do you want to \u2013 Cliff, do you want to try (85:17).", "Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region", "Yeah, I'll respond, if I may, Matt, about the investments and wages. So anything that we know about or has been mandated either locally or by states across the country, we've anticipated that in our plans. We're, obviously, annualizing the investments that we want to make and have built that into our plans for the year ahead. And these are investments such as food benefit for our partners, our college achievement plan, and what we're going to do with our partners there and the increased enrollment, 4,000 partners today and we see that number increasing significantly in the coming years. We've anticipated that and we've planned for it. And, obviously, there are some other investments we've made to support our business plan for this year around comp growth, around new stores, around the increased complexity of our business. And we feel very confident with those investments. Obviously anything that comes along during the year we'll respond to and we'll deal with it accordingly and update you as the year goes on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Buckley from Bank of America.", "Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Can I ask a clarifying question? I think, Howard, in your remarks you said mobile payments were 21% of the mix, and, Kevin, I think you used the same percentage for the month of October. So I guess I just want to clarify what period that 21% applied to and maybe both. And then if you would talk a little bit about what the Mobile Order & Pay component of mobile pay is and just how do you see that building as the rollout \u2013 well, the rollout is over now, but how do you see that building over time?", "Kevin R. Johnson - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, Joe, this is Kevin. The 21% of tender being paid for with the mobile payments was a statistic for the month of October. That's the latest data point that we have. So it's 21% for October. In terms of data on percent of transactions or percent of tender that's Mobile Order & Pay, since we just finished the rollout in the U.S. late in the quarter, we don't have a full run-rate of quarter, so we're still watching that advance. I think Adam gave you some color on some of the locations that are seeing high usage of that. But each wave of deployment we have made has been adopted faster than the prior wave.", "And so I think that there will always be some customers that will go into the store that want the in-store experience that will order at the point of sale and pay mobile. And then other customers that will want to do Mobile Order & Pay for convenience, and they'll pay. So you think about Mobile Order & Pay will always be a subset of the total mobile payment tender that we take. And as soon as we have some track record of full quarters of data, we'll be in a better position to share. Adam, do you want to add anything to that?", "Adam B. Brotman - Chief Digital Officer, Executive Vice President", "Yeah, just building on what you said, Kevin. This is Adam. Howard mentioned that we're seeing a five million mobile order per month run-rate already. And while we're not breaking out specific percentages, there is a range of mobile order numbers across a number of store tiers particularly in our busiest tiers and we are seeing significantly more incremental transactions, incrementality in our busiest stores. We are seeing, internationally, our latest wave that went out for Canada and U.K. saw even a faster adoption than the New York wave, which was faster than the previous wave. So we're getting better at getting faster customer adoption and it bodes well for Mobile Order & Pay globally.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Joe, I'll just mention one final point. There are many scenarios where the customer wants the full Starbucks Experience. And then there are other scenarios where that same consumer may want the convenience of Mobile Order & Pay. So we're going to see the balance of consumers that are going to use both. And we think that's a very good thing. We've added this capability that provides significant convenience to the consumer, but we've done it in a way that does not take away from or prevent the full Starbucks Experience on those occasions that that experience is desirable to them. And so, our ability to sort of observe and see how consumers respond and react to this I think is very important. And thus far, I think we're seeing great results, great reception, and we're very confident that we're on the right path.", "Operator", "We have time for one last question. The last question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies. You may ask our question.", "Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, guys. Just a boring numbers question. The G&A was pretty heavy in the 4Q and actually de-levered for the full year. So I'm assuming some of that was incentive comp given the impressive results. But is that where a lot of the technology investment is also falling, Scott, and maybe what is your outlook for the ability to leverage G&A in fiscal 2016?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Thanks, Andy. It definitely was driven by both the technology investment as well as the delevering year-over-year is partially driven by the Japan acquisition just given how the accounting works there. And then some catch-up definitely in the fourth quarter around incentive comp. If you sort of normalize for that, our goal is to grow G&A at half the rate of revenue, and we basically achieved that in 2015. You've just got to strip out some of the accounting from the Japan acquisition and some of the other items that are in there from an investment standpoint. Going forward, we are still targeting to leverage G&A. I will tell you it will be less than that half a rate of revenue growth as we look in 2016. And that's because the technology investments will hit G&A and put a little bit of pressure on that. But we still expect a bit of leverage as we look forward.", "JoAnn DeGrande - Investor Relations", "Thanks, Scott. Thank you for joining us today.

Howard?", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Durga, and welcome, everyone. I taped my conversation today before heading to Johannesburg, where earlier today we opened the first of approximately 150 stores in South Africa, Starbucks's 71st international market.", "In Q2, Starbucks' powerful 24,000-store global retail operation again drove record financial and operating performance, including record revenues, record profits, a 7% increase in comp store sales in the U.S., a 6% increase in comp store sales globally, our 25th consecutive quarter of comp store growth at or above 5% and a stunning increase of 5% in transaction growth and 18% in revenue growth in China. And we remain on plan to end fiscal 2016 with approximately 25,000 stores globally. Our recent classes of new and remodeled retail stores continue to defy established consumer trends away from traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing and deliver record-breaking unit sales, unit economics and return on investment; very strong performance metrics that underscore the increasing power and relevance of the Starbucks brand around the world.", "In light of two very favorable recent developments, I'd like to take a few moments to frame for you the enormity of the near-in and long-term global single-serve opportunity that lies ahead for Starbucks. As many of you know, the last five years Starbucks has built a powerful, sustainable, premium single-serve business, operating on the Keurig K-Cup rails. And today, Starbucks has the leading U.S. market share of both premium single-serve and of premium roast and ground and is the leading brand on the K-Cup platform.", "In 2016, we will sell approximately 1.5 billion Starbucks K-Cups, up almost 20% over last year and representing multiples of K-Cup category growth overall. Last month, we extended our relationship with Keurig on highly favorable terms that provide us with improved economics and increased operating flexibility, including the ability to sell directly into office and other complementary highly profitable channels of distribution. The Starbucks single-serve aspirations do not end with North America, nor do they end with K-Cup, and now we have capability and a clear line of sight on a second equally attractive single-serve opportunity. Because while Keurig has the dominant share of single-serve brewers in North America, it has virtually no share or relevant brewer product anywhere beyond North America.", "Outside of North America is Nestl\u00e9's Nespresso unit that has the leading share of premium single-serve, with a rapidly growing installed base of what we estimate to be over 25 million largely espresso-based brewers in homes around the world. Nespresso also has a strong presence in global away-from-home and hospitality channels utilizing the same capsule design it uses for at home. So here's the opportunity, and it's big.", "For years, customers have been asking us to produce Starbucks branded Nespresso-compatible capsules so they could enjoy Starbucks's quality and espresso varietals through their Nespresso machines, just as they do through their K-Cup brewers in North America. But we could not satisfy that demand because we had not yet cracked the code on roasting, grinding, and packing Starbucks Coffee in order to deliver Starbucks quality in a cup through a Starbucks-designed Nespresso compatible capsule. But now we have. And as we announced at our Annual Shareholders Meeting last month, starting this fall, we will begin leveraging our retail, CPG, e-commerce, digital and loyalty assets in order to market Starbucks's espresso varietals directly to Nespresso's installed customer base.", "We're starting with Europe, Nespresso's largest market, and where in some countries single-serve represents over 40% of all coffee consumed, and 50% of our best Starbucks customers own a Nespresso machine at home. And in the future, we will begin selling Starbucks branded Nespresso compatible pods in additional Starbucks retail markets around the world.", "Improved economics and increased flexibility with Keurig in North America will combine with the new global opportunity presented by Starbucks Nespresso compatibles to enable us to substantially increase the size and profitability of our single-serve business overall and to add significant shareholder value in the quarters and years ahead.", "We also have big long-term plans for single-serve across CAP and in China. As the only truly global premium coffee brand, particularly in China, we are ideally positioned to leverage our deep connection to our customers and our unique retail store footprint to be on the forefront of single-serve in all CAP markets as the morning and at-home coffee ritual evolves.", "Let me turn to China. Starbucks has committed to China, and we now have over 2,000 stores in 100 cities in China and are adding over 10 new stores every week. Our business in China remains very strong, and I personally have no doubt that the Chinese government's commitment to true economic reform is genuine and that its plan to double 2010 per capita income by 2021, resulting in a middle-class in China approaching 600 million people, almost twice the size of the entire current U.S. population, is achievable.", "We are building our business in China through the lens and with the learnings of the success of our business in the U.S. We're building trust in the Starbucks brand and deep authentic connections between our customers and our partners. We're continuing to deliver an elevated in-store experience for our customers, we're increasingly, established Starbucks as a third place between home and work, and we're giving back to the communities we serve, all of which are enabling us to strengthen the equity of the Starbucks brand and develop and expand our retail, license and CPG businesses and partnerships.", "Our partnership with Tingyi that will provide us with over 1 million points of ready-to-drink Frappuccino distribution in China beginning later this quarter is just one notable example, and there will be many that will follow. Today, not only are we building our brand and a great retail store business in China, but we are building a unique retailing capability that separates us from all other retailers and consumer brands and that we will leverage to continue growing our China business long into the future.", "And on June 16, we will open in China what will, in all probability, become the Starbucks highest grossing retail store in the world virtually overnight. It is a stunning new Starbucks store at the main entrance of the new Shanghai Disneyland, a destination that may well become the number one tourist attraction in Asia. Our new Shanghai Disneyland store will showcase the Starbucks experience in all its glory and our premium coffee position and once again underscore the power and the relevance of the Starbucks brand in China and in CAP overall. We're honored that the Disney Company chose Starbucks to so prominently greet its guests at the entrance of the new park.", "I am more convinced than ever that Starbucks is just getting started in China, and I am equally convinced that as we fully roll out our new partnerships with the leading digital companies and brands in China and leverage our unique digital, mobile, card, gifting and loyalty programs across our business in China later this year and ultimately across CAP overall, we will perform at even higher levels of success and profitability in the future than we do today.", "Starbucks continues to redefine the customer-facing mobile and retail experience of the future. Kevin will be taking you through how we are combining proprietary technologies, digital engagement and customer loyalty to create and leverage a dynamic, integrated digital and mobile ecosystem that will continue to (10:35) business and propel it forward, including providing additional details around our Stars Everywhere initiative, the unique and highly opportunistic partnership we recently announced with JPMorgan Chase and Visa, and our breakthrough initiatives around personalization that are enabling us to deliver highly targeted and highly profitable one-to-one marketing programs to our customers wherever they may be.", "I am particularly proud to report that we grew our MSR loyalty program 8% by adding approximately 1 million new members in Q2 alone and that we now have over 12 million active My Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. And the MSR program changes that took effect on April 12 will, for the first time, reward both customer frequency and overall spend, resulting in increased rewards for our best customers at the same time as it enhances in-store efficiency, speed of service and our customer experience overall.", "I'd like to speak for a moment about the excitement we have about the Roastery in the context of Starbucks's overall brand architecture. Our Seattle Roastery continues to delight our customers and perform well ahead of original expectations. Based on experience to date, our current view is that we will ultimately open between 7 and 10 full scale Roasteries around the world in key global cities. Our second Roastery will be opening in New York's Meatpacking District on the corner of 9th Avenue and 15th Street, next to the heavily trafficked Chelsea Market, directly across the street from Google's headquarters and adjacent to Apple's downtown store in 2018. And soon we will be announcing details of our third Roastery, which will be in CAP.", "In addition to providing an immersive customer experience with the Roastery and through the discipline and the opportunity of segmentation, we have been building a new premium brand, Starbucks Reserve. Starbucks Reserve are ultra-premium, micro-lot, single varietal coffees that are being sold at premium prices through select Starbucks stores around the world, creating both increased profitability and further separation from our competitors. And we will continue to open coffee-forward Starbucks stores with elevated Reserve beverage and holding products like those in Williamsburg, Brooklyn; Chelsea, London; and across Asia.", "Now, following the success and the learnings from these stores, we will be opening a new class of Reserve stores beginning in fiscal 2017. We believe we have significant runway to grow and develop our Starbucks Reserve brand on a global basis.", "Starbucks's performance in Q2 demonstrates the continued success of our commitments to delivering an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers and world-leading financial and operating performance and long-term sustainable, profitable growth to our shareholders. With humility, our performance in Q2 is particularly gratifying in that it was achieved in the face of very challenging consumer, geopolitical and economic environments.", "And with that, from South Africa, I turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?", "Kevin R. Johnson - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. Howard touched upon several highlights from the quarter. I will add additional color on our performance and provide further evidence that our strategies for growth are working. And I'll again demonstrate how we are being deliberate and focused in connection with the investments we are making for our future.", "Let's start with the Americas segment. We now have over 15,000 stores throughout the Americas business comprised of nearly 9,000 company operated and over 6,000 licensed stores. Our Americas business continued its track record of delivering consistent, profitable growth with revenue up 10% over last year and record operating margins. Americas comp sales included a 3% increase in transactions and a 5% increase in ticket, rounding to a 7% increase in comp (14:48).", "Our store (14:51) strategy is enabling the introduction of new store formats and faster and more efficient drive-throughs, express stores, and beautiful renovations that provide our customers not only with increased convenience, but a more inviting and comfortable third-place environment. This approach is enabling record-setting unit volume in our new stores.", "The morning daypart, once again our fastest-growing daypart, grew 13% year-on-year, driven by Mobile Order & Pay, strong performance from our core brewed and espresso product lineup and breakfast sandwiches. Flat White and cold brew both continued to gain traction and customer acceptance and drive food attach. In addition to our hot beverage lineup, our expanded iced beverage business is resonating with customers. Our tea business in particular had its strongest quarter in over a year, up 17% year-on-year and contributing one point of comp, fueled by an accelerating sales of Teavana handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks retail stores.", "Creating new customer occasions and driving increased attach are key priorities for our food programs, and we made great progress with our food business this quarter, growing revenues 16% year-on-year and contributing over two points to our comp, with every daypart contributing to this increase. Breakfast sandwiches continue to be a strong driver of the business, delivering nearly 30% revenue growth and driving both traffic and increased attach in the morning daypart. Our innovative new lineup of lunch offerings delivered an 18% year-on-year increase in food revenue during the lunch daypart. And we continue to test and learn as we shape our evenings program. For the first time ever, food represented more than 20% of revenue in the U.S. Our Americas segment had an outstanding Q2.", "Let's now move on to the CAP segment. The China/Asia Pacific business delivered another solid quarter with revenues increasing 14% and operating income up 15% over Q2 a year ago. Noteworthy is that this is the first full quarter in which our 1,100-store Japan retail business was fully included in both our CAP comp and revenue base, resulting in CAP comp growth of 2% in traffic and 2% in ticket, rounding to 3% overall. We now operate over 5,900 stores in CAP, including over 2,000 in Mainland China in more than 100 cities.", "Despite moderating GDP growth in China, Starbucks China grew revenues 18% and transactions 5% in the quarter. We saw particularly strong transaction growth in the largest cities, and our newest China stores continue to deliver record-breaking volume and profit, once again demonstrating the increasing strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand in the China market. As Howard mentioned, we will leverage our loyalty and digital flywheel in China with the rollout of certain features this year and full digital capabilities over time. Our China/Asia Pacific business continues to perform extremely well, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market. While Starbucks is not immune to cyclical changes in the Chinese economy, our long-term outlook remains strong, and we're committed to increasing our store count to over 3,400 in China and to over 10,000 in CAP overall by the end of 2019 \u2013 fiscal 2019.", "Let's move on to EMEA. We continue to build our 2,500-store EMEA business by increasing our store count, entering new countries, including Luxembourg in Q2, with South Africa, Slovakia and Andorra opening this quarter, and introducing new food and beverage offerings. Overall, we added 47 net new stores in EMEA, all in conjunction with licensee partners at high traffic venues such as train stations, airports, supermarkets and through geographic licensees such as Alshaya in the Middle East. We continue to see strong affinity with the brand as evidenced by the opening of our first Starbucks store in Strasbourg, France where hundreds of energized customers lined up to be among the first in the market to enjoy the Starbucks experience.", "Company-operated EMEA stores delivered a 1% comp sales increase in the quarter, the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp growth. With 72% of EMEA stores now licensed or franchised, total system comps are becoming increasingly relevant. Adjusting for continued mix shift from company-owned to licensed and foreign exchange headwinds, which together impacted revenue growth by 11 points, EMEA on an adjusted revenue basis would deliver growth of 7% and system comp growth of 4%, as well as increasing operating income in the quarter. This was in an extremely challenging consumer, economic, geopolitical environment across the region and reinforces the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand in EMEA.", "Looking ahead, we expect to see a continued mix shift to licensed stores in EMEA, where yesterday we announced entry into an agreement to license all 144 of our stores in Germany to an existing licensee partner, AmRest Holdings. This strategy supports our focus on store growth and expanded operating income.", "Let's move on to Channel Development. Our Channel Development segment plays a key role in elevating the Starbucks brand outside of our retail stores. Channel Development has become our second most profitable business segment and once again delivered record revenue and record operating income, growing 8% and 17% respectively. Starbucks has the leading U.S. market share of premium single-serve on the K-Cup platform and premium roast and ground. And this quarter, we expanded our market share position in both of those categories. Our new partnership agreement with Keurig provides us with both improved economics and increased operating flexibility, including the ability to sell directly into complementary profitable channels of distribution, such as hospitality, college/university and office where we consistently grow our business at two times to three times the industry rate.", "Our success in single-serve in the U.S. provides the foundation for a larger aspiration around the single-serve opportunity globally. Later this year, we will introduce the Nespresso-compatible Starbucks capsules in Europe as one step toward building a business that one day may rival the size and profitability of our single-serve business in North America. Our ready-to-drink business in North America continued to see very strong performance in the quarter driven by new beverage innovation, including iced black coffee, refreshers with coconut water and product line extensions for Frappuccino and Doubleshot Energy drinks.", "Outside of North America, we continue to make meaningful progress building our global CPG footprint. Our partnership with Tingyi is on track to launch this summer where we will move to a national presence with distribution in nearly every major city in China. Through our new agreement with PepsiCo Latin America, we are enabling distribution in the Latin American market in the second half of this year. Starbucks Channel Development segment continues to perform extremely well and plays a key role in elevating our brand globally.", "Let's now move on to the progress we are making on our loyalty and digital initiatives. Loyalty remains the cornerstone of our digital flywheel. And in late February, we announced changes to our Starbucks Rewards program that benefit our most loyal customers by leveling the playing field and rewarding both transaction frequency and total spend. With these changes, we also laid the foundation for customers to earn Stars Everywhere which accelerates the pace at which customers earn rewards redeemable only at Starbucks. Rewards membership has accelerated. Just last week alone, we added more than 280,000 new Rewards members. Engaging with these new Rewards members will enable us to accelerate growth of our active Starbucks Rewards customer base.", "Besides bringing us new customers, the program also addresses an operational challenge where under the old program, customers would ask baristas to ring up each item individually in order to get multiple stars, a time-consuming process that created additional work for our baristas, slowed service and lengthened lines. By completely eliminating any incentive to order split, we will improve in-store operations and efficiency and increase line speed.", "I want to take a moment to underscore that the changes in our rewards program will be accretive to comps over time. As we mentioned during our February Starbucks Rewards conference call, as a result of the changes to the program, we anticipate a shift of about one point of comp between transaction and ticket. Also, we may see some noise in Q3 comps as customers react to the new changes of the program; Scott will speak to this further in a moment.", "At the end of the quarter, we had 12 million active Starbucks Rewards customers in the U.S. with total program spend growth of 22% year-on-year. We've seen additional growth in active Reward customers since the launch of the new program last week. Our new mobile app continues to be very well received where today over 86% of our iPhone customers and 79% of our Android customers have already upgraded to the new version of the Starbucks mobile app that released just last week. And we now have almost 19 million users of our mobile app in the U.S. alone. Mobile payment represented 24% of total U.S. tender in Q2, and Mobile Order & Pay continues to be increasingly embraced by our customers. It adds incrementality, especially at peak. Mobile Order & Pay transactions represented approximately 4% of total transactions in the quarter, which was a 40% increase sequentially.", "We are just beginning to see the full benefit of Mobile Order & Pay beyond the speed and convenience it affords to both our customers and partners. Consider this: though still in its infancy, in 300 of our busiest urban stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents over 10% of transactions. And in those same stores at peak, Mobile Order & Pay represents nearly 20% of transactions. In Portland, where we first introduced Mobile Order & Pay in December of 2014, Mobile Order & Pay transaction volume in March was up approximately 150% from March of last year.", "The new Starbucks Rewards program and Starbucks mobile app have positioned us for two very exciting initiatives that you will see unfold later this year. The first initiative through a partnership with JPMorgan Chase and Visa is truly a first of its kind. A Starbucks general purpose prepaid Visa card that will enable Starbucks Reward customers to earn Stars Everywhere Visa is accepted. That's 40 million merchants worldwide. And where all stars earned can only be redeemed at Starbucks, we think this is a big win for our customers.", "In the U.S., total annual spending on credit and debit cards totaled around $9 trillion annually, roughly half on credit and half on debit cards. While the majority of credit cards in use today offer rewards or points, typically with an annual fee, there is no meaningful debit-based rewards card program out there. That means that on more than $4 trillion of annual consumer spending, virtually no one using a debit card is getting rewards. Not anymore. This new Starbucks general purpose prepaid reloadable debit card is unique, and not only is it a win for customers, it is also a win for Starbucks by strengthening our customer engagement and providing us with a direct financial reward for every customer we sign up and leading to attractive interchange rates. Stay tuned for more details about the card and signup information later this year.", "The second exciting initiative evolves around the work we are doing to enable real-time personalization. Let me frame this for you. A major contributor to the success of our rewards program has been the targeted offers that we have made to customers via e-mail. Since launching our targeted offer program in the 2013, we have been providing ways for customers to earn extra stars for purchasing certain items or making additional visits to our stores. However, existing technology had constrained our ability to laser target, respond in the moment, and vary our digital content based on what we know to be an individual customer's preferences and behaviors. All that is changing as we begin to introduce true real-time personalization across our entire digital ecosystem.", "Following the successful implementation of the first wave of this new technology, we can now send significantly improved targeted communications to individual customers based on what we know about their specific tastes and interests, enabling us to become even more relevant to them. Over time, we will expand this capability to a more robust mobile app centric model that enables us at the very moment a customer orders to provide relevant suggestions and recommendations and, when appropriate, incentivized offers to delight our customers. As you can see, we are managing a significant number of accretive changes related to loyalty, digital and Stars Everywhere.", "A few words on the success of the investments we continue to make in our partners and the work we're doing to improve the partner experience overall. Creating an enhanced Starbucks experience for our customers and an authentic and personal connection between our customers and our partners is core to the Starbucks experience. Last year, we began rolling out a number of significant investments in support of our in-store partners that included increased barista and shift supervisor pay rates, additional performance-based recognition, updates to our dress code, a new food benefit, as well as enhancements to our College Achievement program. These investments are paying off. We continue to see increases in partner retention, which is enabling better customer connections, and customer connection is a key driver of our record Q2 performance. As you can see, our results provide powerful evidence that our strategies and focused investments are paying off today, and setting us up for continued growth in the future.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Maw. Scott?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks once again delivered very strong operating and financial performance in Q2 with record Q2 performance across virtually all of our operating and profitability measures, including revenue, operating income, operating margin, and EPS. Noteworthy is that our revenues in Q2 were the highest of any non-holiday quarter in our history. EPS both GAAP and non-GAAP increased 18% to $0.39 in Q2, the top end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP operating income increased 11% over Q2 last year to $887 million, while non-GAAP operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 17.6%.", "Margin improvement in Q2 was driven by sales leverage that more than offset the impact of ongoing investments, particularly in our partners and our digital platforms. It's important to note this quarter that our consolidated operating margin also reflects dilution from a multi-year employment tax audit accrual. More specifically, our 30 basis point increase in operating margin would have been 40 basis points higher or 70 basis points in total, and our operating income growth would have been 240 basis points higher than the reported 11% or 14% with rounding. The impact of this G&A related accrual was largely offset below the operating income line in Q2 income taxes, and is expected to be entirely offset in federal income tax expense by fiscal year-end, resulting in no impact to earnings for full year 2016.", "You may recall that our Investor Day in December 2014, we discussed the importance of reversing the negative leverage we were seeing on cost of goods sold and G&A. I am pleased to report that the plans we put in place to do so are working and that on top of the significant progress we made on that front last year, so far this year we are seeing an additional 60 basis points of COGS and occupancy leverage driven mostly by COGS and 40 basis points of G&A leverage.", "Return on invested capital expanded by over 100 basis points in the first half of 2016 compared to the prior year, once again reflecting excellent returns on our core businesses and demonstrating the outsized return we are generating on many of our significant newer investments. And our reported record Q2 results became even more noteworthy in light of the fact that foreign currency translation shaved a full point off revenue and two points off operating income growth in the quarter.", "I'll now take you through how each of our major operating segments performed in Q2. In Q2, our Americas segment operating margin expanded 80 basis points over Q2 last year to 23.5%, primarily driven by sales leverage and favorable commodity costs, partially offset by ongoing store partner and digital platform investments, that together adversely impacted operating margin by 100 basis points in the quarter. Noteworthy again, as we mentioned last quarter, is that we continue to see essentially no net cannibalization of existing stores as we expand our store footprint in the Americas and leverage our full portfolio of new and existing store formats. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect the Americas segment to deliver moderate margin expansion over prior year.", "Let's move on to our China/Asia Pacific segment. In Q2, on a GAAP basis, CAP operating income grew 15% over last year to a Q2 record $129 million, and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 19.1%, driven primarily by strong sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of increased compensation and benefit costs and store operating expenses. Excluding the 90 basis point impact of foreign exchange, CAP margins expanded by 110 basis points in the quarter.", "Profitability of our Japan and China store portfolio continues to increase with our profitability of our store class up nicely from the previous age class. And as Kevin mentioned, returns on our new stores in these two important markets are among the highest Starbucks is generating anywhere in the world. For the full fiscal year 2016, we expect CAP revenue growth to be within our previously stated mid-teens target range and CAP margins are now expected to be roughly flat compared to 2015 levels.", "We also still expect CAP comps for the year to be in the mid-single digits despite falling just below that threshold for the current quarter, somewhat impacted by the addition of our Japan business into the CAP comp calculation. Japan is the largest component of the CAP comp base with a weighting of just over 50% of the total.", "Turning to EMEA, EMEA's operating margin declined 10 basis points in Q2 relative to last year to 10.3%, largely due to certain gains in the prior year related to the sale of assets as we shifted more stores from company operated to our licensed model. Excluding these gains and the impact of FX headwinds, EMEA's operating margin expanded slightly in Q2. As Kevin mentioned, our licensed stores in EMEA showed strong comp and profitability growth in Q2 and income from licensees now represents roughly 60% of the total operating income we generate from EMEA. Despite challenging macroeconomic, geopolitical and consumer environments that persist across the EMEA region, we remain confident that EMEA's operating margins will approach 15% in fiscal 2016, once again up nicely over the prior year.", "Our Channel Development segment had another very strong quarter in Q2. Operating margin increased 300 basis points in the quarter to 39.5%, and operating income reached a new quarterly record of $182 million, up 17% over last year driven primarily by cost of sales leverage, favorable coffee costs and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi. For the full fiscal year, we expect Channel Development to increase revenues by approximately 10% year-over-year with the back half of the year growing in the high single digits following the 12% growth rate we saw in the first six months.", "Channel Development's record breaking Q1 performance, very strong Q2 results and positive outlook for the balance of the year has us confident that the segment will post moderate margin expansion in fiscal 2016 over last year. Given the momentum we are seeing in the business, we are also expecting strong operating leverage over the next two quarters.", "Given the excellent performance across the company year-to-date, we are moving the bottom end of our fiscal year 2016 EPS range up slightly from our previous guidance while retaining the top-end. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.86 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.88 to $1.89 including the 53rd week, which by our rough estimate adds approximately $0.06 to Q4. For Q3, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.47 to $0.48 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.48 to $0.49. For the full year, foreign exchange is now expected to negatively impact revenue growth by one point to two points and operating income growth by two points to three points. We continue to expect to grow revenues by 10% or greater on a 52-week basis with the 53rd week adding approximately two points to the full fiscal year figure. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver comp sales growth somewhat above the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year 2016. But as Kevin indicated, there exists the potential for some bumpiness in Q3 as a result of the Starbucks Rewards program changes that took effect earlier this month. And as we mentioned on our February Starbucks Rewards conference call, going forward we expect to see a point or so of movement between traffic and ticket within comp in each of the next four quarters as our customers adapt to the changes.", "Noteworthy is that given the significant value and benefits conferred on our customers in the new program, we fully expect the changes to be accretive to each of comps, revenue and profitability over time. The investment in our partner and digital initiatives globally will total between $275 million and $300 million in fiscal 2016 compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. And the benefits and the returns we are realizing from these investments are becoming increasingly apparent. We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly relative to 2015 on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis, reflecting strong revenue growth, sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.", "Moving on to commodities, with 2016 costs coffee needs fully priced, we expect a slightly favorable impact for the year. We will continue to take careful advantage of lower coffee prices while ensuring that we source only the highest quality coffee and provide fair economics to coffee growers around the globe. We expect to add approximately 1,800 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, 700 in Americas, 900 in China/Asia Pacific, and 200 in EMEA. The outlook for our effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 34%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016.", "Finally, with the strong cash flows driven by our record-breaking holiday period, we took advantage of recent equity market volatility and significantly increased our share buyback activity since the end of Q1. We returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in Q2 alone, the highest amount in any single quarter in our 24-year history as a publicly-traded company, with share repurchases in the quarter nearly equal to buyback activity in all of 2015. And as we announced today, our Board of Directors recently increased our share buyback authority by an additional 100 million shares.", "As I mentioned at the outset, Q2 was another quarter of strong growth and excellent financial, operating and profit performance for Starbucks. And once again, the credit goes to our partners around the world who continue to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers every day.", "The tremendous momentum we have created over the first half of fiscal 2016 ideally positions us to benefit from the investments we are making in our partners, in our stores, and in groundbreaking innovation and to continue delivering world-class returns to our shareholders. And we will do so despite today's challenging global economic and geopolitical landscape.", "Now, we'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks. Good evening. With regard to the rewards switch that you just mentioned and that noise that you mentioned that tradeoff of one point to two points, is there a net drag to overall same store sales that you're seeing so far, or is this simply just an exaggerated version of the traffic versus check tradeoff that you expected earlier?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, thanks, David. We're not trying to signal any trends that we're seeing early in the quarter or post launch. And in fact, as Kevin referenced, we have seen an increase in account activity and customer acceptance post launch. All we're trying to say is this is a big change. It's a very positive change. We're bullish on it in the long-term. But it's a big change in customers. We've got a number of plans in place to leverage the new program, and we'll keep an eye on things as the quarter moves on. But you notice we haven't changed our guidance for the year, and we're not trying to signal anything about intra-quarter trends.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you. There's been a lot of focus on getting COGS leverage and G&A leverage over the past couple of years. So the question is really on the labor expense at the store where you have been making significant investments over the last four quarters or so. So as we think about over the next year, do those increases in labor costs begin to slow, and is there anything that Starbucks can do to begin to get more efficiency out of that line which has been deleveraging?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right. What I would say, John, is we expect to continue to make those partner in digital investments as we move through time. We know that they're driving comps. We have talked before about the tie between the changes we made about a year ago in pay for our U.S. store partners and the increase in comps that started at the same time. And in fact, what we see is at the stores that have the lowest turnover, they have the highest comps. And we've seen turnover tick down since we've made those changes. So it's all tied together, it's highly accretive and highly profitable. So we'll continue to make those investments.", "And as we go into each year, we'll talk a little bit about the size of those investments, the impact on leverage. But there are other places in the P&L that we can go to continue to grow EPS at 15% to 20%, which is our long-term range, G&A and COGS just being two of them. And then (44:50) and the team have done a nice job driving productivity on \u2013 in the stores and Mobile Order & Pay has been a key aspect of that to help us with throughput at peak. And as Kevin said, peak was once again our fastest-growing daypart in this quarter. Last quarter, it was our fastest-growing daypart in over five years. And as you know, last quarter is the first quarter we had Mobile Order & Pay fully rolled out and what we're seeing, based upon the numbers that Kevin showed, is in those busiest stores at peak, Mobile Order & Pay is driving significant productivity and throughput. So those are all places elsewhere in the P&L we can go to fund the investments we need to drive growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. I was wondering, in the CAP segment, if you could be a little bit more specific on the same store performance in both Japan and China?", "John Winchester Culver - Group President-China/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands", "Yeah, Joe. This is John. First off, obviously, from a CAP perspective, the composition of comp has changed dramatically over the past year with the weighting of Japan coming in. If you go back a year ago, sequentially Japan was not included in the comp base at all in 2015 and it was only partially included in Q1, and now we have it fully included in Q2. When you look at the total comp growth for the region, we came in at a rounding basis of 3%. 2% of that was transactions and 2% was ticket. But more importantly, when you go into China and you dig underneath China, we delivered a 5% transaction growth rate across the country. And when you dig even deeper into that, in our Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities where we have over 65% of our stores, we outpaced that 5% growth \u2013 transaction growth rate significantly. So for us, we have great optimism around the opportunity that exists for us in China as well as in Japan. We continue to see very strong new store performance, as Scott highlighted, in both China and Japan, with record revenues and record sales results and significant return on investment. So for us, we remain very bullish on the opportunity that exists not only in China, but then also across the entire segment.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And I would add, in those larger cities, that's where we have most of our new store growth targeted. And so that's why you see revenue growth at 18% and the overall CAP segment continuing to drive the profitability and revenue growth that we expect.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Keith Siegner with UBS. Your line is open.", "Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you. Just two quick questions on Channel Development. The first one, it sounds like there's so much good stuff coming later this year: new economics with K-Cups, we've got Nespresso-compatible pods, we've got ready-to-drink options expanding. There's a lot of moving pieces that sound very beneficial. But yet you mentioned lower revenue growth in the second half. Maybe you could talk through why?", "And then the second part of it would be, against the five-year operating profit targets that you laid out in December 2014, one of them was doubling Channel Development. Would all of these new announcements that you made, are we still within that target? Could this actually outpace that target? Where are we against that five-year plan? Thanks.", "John Winchester Culver - Group President-China/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands", "Yeah, Keith, this is John. Let me take the first part of the question, and then I'll turn the second piece over to Scott. And clearly, Channel Development continues to perform very, very strong for us as a company with the 8% revenue and 17% income growth in the quarter. We are gaining share across all categories that we operate in, whether it's the roast and ground category, premium coffee, or K-Cups. This was our 17th consecutive quarter of share growth in the Channel Development business across all categories. And in the quarter, we grew five times the category average and our shares increased over 100 basis points. Roast and ground, we now have a 25.3% share growth and K-Cups share now sits at 16.3%.", "And when you look at the success that we're having in channels, a couple things are driving it. First, it's the execution that we're seeing in the stores and the merchandising that we're doing and the fact that we're winning down the aisle. It's the fact that we're increasing our points of distribution. We've seen significant success with the larger pack size that we've introduced and clearly that's been driving our share gains across all our major categories.", "In addition, we've taken the My Starbucks Rewards program and introduced that down the aisle as well, where in the quarter we saw an 18% increase in the number of codes that were redeemed and today we have over 20 million codes entered by over 2 million MSR customers in the CPG segment. So for us, we're very encouraged by the results that we're seeing in the category and in the segment, and we're very bullish on continuing to deliver that double-digit growth for the entire year as we look to finish out the year strong.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, Keith, on your second question, what I would say is in the near term, the new Green Mountain agreement doesn't go into place until later this quarter. So not \u2013 a little bit more than a quarter impact in this year's earnings. Over the long-term, there could be upside to the range that we gave back at Investor Day, and I think one of the key pieces to that is all of the international opportunities that Kevin and John laid out. And so I think as you look at international CPG growth, particularly over the medium-term, out a couple, three years, once the partnerships get up and running and we get product rolling off the lines, if those things go as well as we expected, there could be some upside there.", "John Winchester Culver - Group President-China/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands", "Yeah, Keith, and just one other thing I would just add on the K-Cup opportunity, when you look at K-Cups, we grew more than three times the rate of the category this past quarter. And the new Keurig agreement gives us an opportunity to extend the agreement, number one, on very favorable terms. We have improved economics coming in, as Scott highlighted. But more importantly, we have greater operating flexibility in terms of being able to drive more innovation into the K-Cup category, additional SKUs, and new packaging. And we also have the opportunity to now sell the K-Cups directly into office, into food service, college and universities, hotels, and C stores. So, we're on track this year to do about 1.5 billion K-Cups, and we expect this category to push near the 20% growth rate for the entire year for us. So very optimistic on the opportunity that K-Cups has.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much. I just want to go back to the Americas traffic of 3%. You seem very pleased with the throughput given mobile ordering. Is there other constraints in other parts of the business? I mean, the 5% and the 3% don't add up to \u2013 they add up to 8% to 7%, so one of those or both of those are probably a little less than a whole number.", "And just as a related question, in my observation, does the new chip credit cards \u2013 has that slowed transactions down, for example? Are there obvious bottlenecks or maybe just a little color around that in general, please?", "Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region", "Yeah, thanks, John. I have to say I'm really pleased with the traffic we're seeing. The 3% on traffic and the 5% on ticket, as you say, rounding to a 7%. It's our 25th consecutive quarter of 5% or better comp growth for the Americas. At the same time, we're seeing very, very strong growth in our new stores, and they are adding, in total, 4% to our revenue growth. So things are very, very healthy and we're seeing great progress there. Mobile Order & Pay just gets better and better as it becomes a normal part of doing our business. And as you heard earlier, the strength in the higher volume stores at peak gives us confidence we can keep growing our capacity and our comp through the stores.", "I think the other thing just to add is daypart. We are seeing growth across all dayparts being led by the morning. So we're very, very pleased with this. And the EMV or the Chip and PIN is negligible at the moment. We're in the early phases of rolling out, and we're just working through the ways that that will be implemented across the system and we're planning for it not to have any impact on transaction speed overall.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And, Adam, why don't you talk a little bit more about Mobile Order & Pay and what we're seeing?", "Adam B. Brotman - Chief Digital Officer", "Yeah, thanks. This is Adam. So, first of all, as we mentioned in the remarks earlier, our overall average number of percentage of transactions for Mobile Order & Pay is 4% across all stores, all dayparts, all store types in the U.S. But that's just the beginning of the story with Mobile Order & Pay.", "First of all, Kevin mentioned in his remarks, over 10% of all orders at our busiest 300 stores are mobile orders, and it's been noted that we're seeing mobile orders comprise 7% of all orders at our busiest 1,200 stores. So when you really look at our busiest stores, Mobile Order & Pay is very important.", "And drilling into that further, when you look at the busiest (54:48) peak for those 300 busiest stores, for example, mobile orders are already approaching 20% of transactions at those peak hours. So you're really seeing how Mobile Order & Pay is benefiting all customers. It's benefiting the overall store performance in all these stores because of the incrementality and throughput unlock. Of course, Mobile Order & Pay is allowing customers convenience so they can have that incremental visit, incremental occasion they wouldn't normally have time for, but it's also driving a huge capacity unlock because of the program. You take 20% of transactions at peak, out of the line, out of POS, and you see it benefit all stores and allow customers to benefit from less people in line and allow partners and customers to benefit from the fact that now our partners can concentrate more of their energy on making food and beverage, on connecting with customers, and that's a big capacity and throughput unlock. And as a result, we're seeing Mobile Order & Pay meet or beat all of our expectations and grow as we mentioned in a way that's very pleasing to us.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And, John, I'd just also remind you that Cliff's business had nearly 9,000 stores. It's going to approach $15 billion in revenue this year, and it's rounding down this quarter to 7% comps with 3% transaction. Those are really significant numbers, and I just sort of remind everyone of that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.", "Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks. One thing we didn't touch on is with the full quarter of delivery now underway, just was curious about your early learnings from that. Your customers using it primarily in the mornings or is it more balanced over the course of the day relative to in-store transactions? And also, what would lead you to expand the Green Apron Delivery to more stores? What do you need to see before you do that? Thanks.", "Adam B. Brotman - Chief Digital Officer", "Thanks, Andrew. This is Adam. It's still very early on delivery. So, the headline is that we're continuing to learn. Yes, the orders are in the morning like we're seeing in other examples. But frankly, we're continuing to learn how does this integrate with our technology, what's the customer behavior, what's working well? And so we're not prepared to talk too much about delivery yet while we're still in the learning phase but stay tuned for more in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Thanks. Just one question, two quick clarifications, if I may. Back on the Channel Development question earlier, because I think it's an important one, if I recall right, lower coffee prices would be shared with the consumer in Channel Development more so, well, than a retail store, and maybe that's what's driving high single-digit growth because there is discounting. You give back when coffee prices go down, whereas underlying business is still \u2013 when you normalize that growing double digit. I just want to see if that gut check is right.", "And then, did Easter have any shift \u2013 any impact, the early Easter, that you would call out? Thanks and congrats on another great quarter.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Nicole, I think what I would say is we continued to grow volumes significantly independent of price. I will say that both in K-Cups and roast and ground, it's competitive. We continue to gain share in that competitive environment. We continue to outgrow in food service by many times the industry. So we're able to work through that pricing. But we are seeing volume growth somewhat above revenue growth. So I think that lines up with your overall pricing comment.", "John Winchester Culver - Group President-China/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands", "Yeah, Nicole, this is John. I would agree with what Scott said. The volumes when you take pricing out and you just look at total pounds sold, our pounds are outpacing as well. So we feel very confident that the business again is very healthy down the aisle, that we continue to take share, and that we are priced appropriately for the consumer. And we're not only taking it from other premium retailers, but you're seeing the mainstream customers also trading up into the premium segment and trading into Starbucks, frankly.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Any impact from Easter, John?", "John Winchester Culver - Group President-China/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands", "No sequential impact to Easter. We did have a very good Easter holiday, as we did last year.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Great.", "Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region", "I'm not sure, Nicole, whether you were commenting on Easter as it refers to the retail business, but here in the U.S., early Easter did not have a material impact. It obviously does change spring breaks, but all in all, it is not significant to the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much. Maybe just two related questions on the U.S. comp. Just first, it would seem like the compares now \u2013 well, they have been growing increasingly difficult as we move through this whole year, so I am just wondering whether it would be fair to expect the comp deceleration at least on a one-year basis from the current 7%, just based purely on a comparison.", "And as a follow-up, I am just wondering whether the offset on that \u2013 or what the offset on that could be? And it would seem like Mobile Order & Pay would be the biggest near-term opportunity to buck that trend. It seems like you're talking quite favorably about the order and pay signup and whatnot. Just wondering whether you can perhaps frame for us where it could go, and I think you said it's now 8 million transactions a month. I think the number was 6 million just last quarter and I know we're in very early ramp-up mode, so I'm just wondering if you had any insight into where that number could go over the next 12 months. Thanks.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think I'm going to have Adam start with the mobile order question. I'll talk about U.S. comp guidance, and Cliff can jump in on the operational things we have going.", "Adam B. Brotman - Chief Digital Officer", "Yeah, Jeffrey. This is Adam. So just in terms of the growth in Mobile Order & Pay, let me touch on a couple of things. One is that you're right, so we had 8 million Mobile Order & Pay transactions per month run rate on this quarter, up from the 6 million the previous quarter. And so you get the 40% sequential growth that Kevin mentioned. You also have the fact that we are seeing a huge number of new capabilities that we're going to be adding to this, which will continue to grow that momentum and accelerate us. So one of them is that we added the ability for customers to redeem their rewards in the Mobile Order & Pay flow just 10 days ago. We're seeing great customer excitement about that. And as I've said before, we're going to continue to add a large number of new features for Mobile Order & Pay, including favorite stores, favorite orders and recommendations in the flow, all of which will contribute to the growing acceleration of Mobile Order & Pay as we move over time.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And then on guidance, what I would say, Jeffrey, is we're still saying somewhat above mid-single digits for the year. That obviously relies on good performance in the U.S. business, and I'll let Cliff talk to some of the things we have lined up for the back half of the year. It expects good performance in CAP as we look at the back six months and some recovery in EMEA. But as we look forward, we have a number of things in each of those geographies as the summer comes up to drive additional transaction, additional comps (1:02:19) and additional profitability. And I'll let Cliff speak to the (1:02:20).", "Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region", "Yeah. Thanks, Scott. It really does start, Mobile Order & Pay. We've got our new Starbucks Rewards, and we're really excited by the early signup and contribution that is going to come from that. We have a fantastic season ahead of us, building on the strength of last year, whether it's Frappuccino or later on in the summer with our cold brewed coffees, our iced coffees and a recent introduction of Nitro into select stores. And we're in the early phase of that. And I think our Teavana iced teas are set for a fantastic season. And all of that is going to be complemented by the continued growth we are seeing in our food in the U.S. now, where we're up to 20% contribution coming from food, and it's the first time we've seen it there, and we continue to see growth in our cold beverages. So we've got a great season ahead.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Matt, maybe talk a little bit about the new rewards program.", "Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer", "Sure. And let me comment first of all that we were a little over a week out from launch here, so these are very early days, but they're very encouraging nonetheless. In addition to the signups we're seeing, the new people raising their hands to join, we're seeing a couple other very encouraging things. Spend per member is up across the board, and I know somebody is going to ask this question, so let me try to get ahead of it here. We do obviously track all cohorts of people in our rewards program, and they are the people who are going to be better off by the new rules, they are going to be the majority of people who are more or less the same and a small minority of people who will earn rewards a little bit slower. All three of those cohorts are up in terms of spend so far. And we see absolutely no difference in the percentage among those three cohorts. So we are not seeing any of the noise that has been speculated on coming to bear. So very encouraging news there. And we'll be keeping a very close eye on it, and obviously, there's a lot of unlocked that comes with the new rewards program as well, too. It's enabling the stars as currency initiatives because of the lowering of the denomination of the star. We have a lot of runway ahead with this, and we're very excited about what it will do in the long-term.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open.", "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good afternoon. My question actually you just answered on the loyalty program, but I guess as a follow-up to that, the new partnership that you have with the prepaid debit card, I am curious to know how you are planning to support that and how that will work in terms of stars being earned and just what the pace of that rollout and development of that strategy might be? And then, was that the primary motivation for reducing the value of the stars or are there other initiatives that have yet to be announced that are on the way?", "Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer", "Sure. It's a multiple-part question. Let me see if I can remember all of them and get through it. With the program, the timetable for the actual product facing forward to customers will be late this year. The product obviously will work just like the current product works except it will bear the Visa mark on it, and it will be a general purpose stored value card that works everywhere. We'll be announcing all the details about how to sign up and the exact value proposition as we get closer and have a way for customers to sign up. But we're on track to do it this year.", "With regard to whether or not that was the primary motivation, the answer is no. There are a number of different things that we're going to be able to do as a result of lowering the denomination of a star. So you can expect this to be the first of a number of partnerships that you'll see down the road in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason West with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah. Thanks. Sorry to circle back on this again but, Scott, I am just still confused about the message you guys are sending around the rewards change. It sounds like signups are up, you are very happy with the overall program, but you're using the word noise and bumpiness. So I am just trying to understand, are you saying that there has been some customer pushback on the changes and it's going to take time for people to get used to the new system? Or are you saying there has actually been a strengthening in the program? That would be helpful. Thanks.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I just want to remind, we launched it a week ago. And so the first week metrics that Matt talked about are encouraging. But there's obviously a lot of customer spending and behavior that will happen over the coming weeks. And given the importance of the MSR program and the significance of the changes, we think broadly beneficial. But to some customers, they may not feel so benefited. We want to just make sure we communicate to you guys that there could be some noise. We're not seeing it yet. We'll see how the quarter plays out. So nothing in the early results but this is a big deal for us and we want to make sure we get it right.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Scott, can I add something from South Africa about that?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "First of all, I have been very quiet on the phone because you guys are doing such a great job. But it's very odd sitting here in South Africa listening to this. But I think the answer to the question is with great transparency, we just want to make sure that everyone understands this is a complicated change for our customers, lots of training for our people, and I think the better part of valor is just to say to you upfront that there could be some noise in the quarter. We're not signaling anything, but as Matt said, we're building something so significant over the long-term that I wouldn't be so concerned about noise in the quarter if there is some because what's happening here is we're building something so enduring and so unique that I think it's going to be one of the most significant changes to the equity of the brand, customer experience. And as Kevin said earlier, the opportunity for Stars Everywhere in terms of ubiquity of people using that debit card and the only way they can bring back stars and get rewards is to Starbucks is going to be a significant flywheel effect on our overall business. So I think we just wanted to just be open with you about the complication and the degree of the significant change. But the long-term is so beneficial for our customers and obviously to our shareholders.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Howard.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, guys. I want to circle back on Channel Development, more on the profitability side. Margin-wise, you're up 250 basis points in the first half, yet just guiding to moderate improvement for the year. So what are the cost implications or are there things going on with the new Nespresso rollout in the back half of the year with whomever you are using? And actually, who are you using to manufacture those, if you care to share?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I'll take the first part of the question. I think you can expect to see margin expansion in that same range that you saw in the first half, which is obviously very strong at 250 basis points. I guess it's just the definition of moderate. We continue to see revenue growth opportunities. We continue to take share, and we continue to do that at highly profitable overall margins. And so we see that continuing throughout the rest of this year. And although the Green Mountain change doesn't impact us too much this year just because of the timing of it, that has a chance to help us as we look forward into next year. And I'll let John answer that manufacturing question perhaps.", "John Winchester Culver - Group President-China/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands", "Yeah, Andy, I'm not going to disclose who we're working with from a manufacturing standpoint, only to say that we are in a position now to launch the Nespresso-compatible pods in both our retail stores, as well as through the CPG channels across the U.K. and France later this year. We are focusing first and foremost on Europe because there's 25 million machines of Nespresso machines that are installed there. It's a very similar size right now in comparison to the number of install base on Keurig here in the U.S., and we feel there is a significant opportunity to build this capsule business similar to the way we built the K-Cup business here in the U.S. And as Howard highlighted on his comments, single-serve represents 40% of the coffee consumed in-home in Europe and nearly 50% of our Starbucks customers have Nespresso machines in their homes and so we see this as being a big opportunity.", "Beyond Europe, the big size of the prize is going to be in CAP, and more importantly in China, and we are going to continue to look at how we expand the single-serve opportunity as the only truly leading global premium coffee brand in Asia across our store footprint, and really go after this opportunity as well. So looking forward to the growth opportunity that exists both in Europe as well as in Asia around the single-serve opportunity.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I have a question a bit more on the rolling out of a better targeting solution. I'm curious what the end game of this is. Is it something that you think you will be able to better control exactly, what percentage of rewards are redeemed? Does it ultimately lead to more redemptions per person or more traffic per person on the back end of it? And I might have missed it in the prepared remarks, but was there \u2013 is it something that's rolling out now or something that's coming later this year? Thanks.", "Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer", "Sure. Matt Ryan here. We're in the process of rolling that out and you'll see that across the remainder of this year. What we're talking about doing is basically stepping up our game with regard to how we communicate with customers and there are a couple key components to it right now. To date, we've really communicated in a targeted way via e-mail. And as we progress through the year, you're going to begin to see the targeted communication emerge within our digital platform, specifically our app with recommendations. So we don't catch people in the moment right now. We will be catching people in the moment as time goes on, so that's a very important piece.", "We also are going to be able to use triggers and to target much more individually than we currently do. We have limitations because of the technology right now on how many different messages we can put out. Those limitations go away with the investments in technology that we've already made. So you'll see, from a customer perspective, more relevant, more targeted messages, some of which will be offers, and that will allow us to basically manage those more economically in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.", "Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you. I think you may have answered this question in a different way, but I just wanted to make sure that there was specific mention of how you're going to \u2013 you looked at the Mobile Order & Pay transition and also the combination of switching over to the new loyalty program as being accretive to both margins and to the top line over time. I wonder, was that purposely said to say over time? Is there any investment when you switch over in the loyalty program that you might do that might be upfront loaded to hold on to that lower ticket customer that might look at this as his reward program is being devalued a little bit, the guy who spends less than $5 per transaction? I was just curious if that was purposely said over time, meaning there might be some upfront investment to discount that guy or give him extra rewards and target him so you don't \u2013 so you keep him thinking he is getting big rewards.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Matt. No, there's no big upfront investment from a technology standpoint or from any customer standpoint. What I will say is we're obviously investing in marketing and in-store training for partners and messaging for customers just to make sure everyone is crystal clear on the program. And then as we talked about in our February call, we have a number of contingency plans and things that we can do with some of the personalization capabilities that Matt just talked about to target any cohorts of customers that may be displaying lower frequency or different types of behavior. But those won't be expensive. They won't be a big impact in the quarter. I think the only reason we said over time is obviously we expect the momentum to build with this program. Customer will become familiar with it. They'll get used to earning more stars. We'll layer in the Chase opportunity in some of the other Stars Everywhere opportunities, and those will really build. But it will be profitable immediately and build over time.", "Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer", "If I just could add to that. One of the things when you sign up new members, you don't necessarily see all the value in the first few weeks or even first few months of somebody signing up, it is something that laps over time. So as you build the membership of Starbucks Rewards, that is a benefit that keeps on showing up in the results for not just months but years to come.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks for the follow-up. Just a quick one on breakfast sandwiches. Your check growth has been up 5% and I think you said breakfast sandwiches are up 30%. That might be the majority of the check growth, if I'm doing the right math. I guess the question is, how are you doing it? Do you think you can keep it going with regard to that sales layer? Thanks.", "Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region", "Matt (sic) [Dave] (1:16:55), we said that breakfast sandwiches were up nearly 30% in the quarter year-on-year, food overall was up 16%, lunch contributed an 18% growth. So you're absolutely right. We're getting some uplift on ticket plus better attach from food. But by no means is that accounting for all of our growth. We continue to focus on price giving us between 1% and 2%, and the rest is from either the swift movement to a higher ticket product or increased attach, and we're seeing a mix of all three of those.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And, David, I would just add in the morning daypart, the breakfast sandwich is a meaningful contributor, but really it's all three of those items that Cliff outlined: a bit of price, premiumization or up-leveling, and attach at morning and at lunch both very strong.", "Operator", "The last question comes from R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar. You may ask your question.", "R.J. Hottovy - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Thanks. I had a quick follow-up question on the single-serve business and I was particularly struck by Howard's comments about the future opportunity in CAP with the single-serve product. I was just hoping you could give us a preliminary roadmap as to how you see this business evolving over the next couple of years, and in particular if there is any particular hurdles that you have to overcome to really accelerate that business. Thanks.", "John Winchester Culver - Group President-China/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands", "Yeah, thanks, R.J. This is John.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "John, can I just...", "John Winchester Culver - Group President-China/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands", "Sure. Go ahead, Howard.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "John, can I lead with that and just give it right back to you?", "John Winchester Culver - Group President-China/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands", "Sure.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think John should answer the question specifically, but the thing that I would mention is throughout Asia and specifically Japan and China, we have a very, very large strategic advantage in that distribution in terms of educating the consumer, demonstrating the product and really I think leveraging our ability to educate the customer the way we have just with regard to our basic coffee business. We are in a unique position to leverage the national footprint we have in Japan, in Korea, and obviously in China. And it will be very difficult for the single-serve companies who are in the machine business to really create national distribution. So our ability to leverage the equity of the brand, the in-store experience puts us in a lead position. And I think that, as John said in his comments, there's no global super-premium brand of coffee, and specifically, that doesn't exist at all in Asia other than Starbucks. So we're in a very unique position as we have to train the customer, educate them on all-things-coffee. And as the category evolves, and it certainly will, the biggest prize for single-serve ultimately is going to be China. And our store base is going to give us a tremendous advantage, not if, but when that market emerges.", "John, go ahead.", "John Winchester Culver - Group President-China/Asia Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands", "Yeah. And the only thing I would add, Howard, to that is the fact that the single-serve business is really \u2013 does not exist in China nor in Asia to any significant degree. So this is all white space. And as Howard said, we are truly the only global premium coffee brand both in Japan, Korea, China, or the rest of Asia that is going to be able to leverage a retail footprint and an awareness and a trust level with our consumers on educating them about in-home consumption of single-serve coffee. So we are building plans as it relates to going after this opportunity, and we will follow up with you on what those plans are going to look like in future calls.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Before we end the call...", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It wasn't too long ago \u2013 go ahead, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was just going to say it wasn't that many years ago where people would not walk in the street holding a Starbucks cup because they might lose faith in Asia. Now, obviously, throughout Asia, specifically Japan and China, that's exactly what's going on. It wasn't that many years ago where the morning ritual did not exist in many of those countries and other than China that it now exists and we're beginning to see it in China. So single-serve is going to be a major business throughout the region, and we're going to be in a winning position to take advantage of it.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Howard, I thought before we ended the call, we would just turn it back to you to see if you had any final comments.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I was just saying now that we have opened here in South Africa, this is our 71st country and market, I just wish that the people listening to the call could witness firsthand what we have seen now throughout the world, and that is the universal acceptance of Starbucks Coffee Company and what we're doing in-store, the relationship we have with our partners, the relationship we have with our customers. And I have said for many, many years, these are the still the early days of the growth and development of the company. And despite with 24,000 stores globally, I've never been more enthused especially sitting here so far away from our home in Seattle and seeing exactly what we started in the early years, and that is Starbucks being the third place between home and work and delivering extraordinary cup of coffee. And it's just a wonderful opportunity for us once again to open up a new market, especially here in South Africa.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes Starbucks Coffee Company's second quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call.

Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2016 results, which will be led by Howard Schultz, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Johnson, President and COO; and Scott Maw, our CFO. Joining us for Q&A are Cliff Burrows, Group President, U.S. and Americas; John Culver, Group President, China, Asia-Pacific, Channel Development and Emerging Brands; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; Adam Brotman, Global Chief Digital Officer; and Michael Conway, President of Global Channel Development.", "This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. Please refer to our website at investor.starbucks.com to find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.", "This conference call is being webcast, and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website at investor.starbucks.com. Before I turn the call over to Howard, I would like to take this opportunity to make you aware of our Biennial Investor Day, which will be held on December 7 in New York City. More details will be coming soon. We hope to see you there, so please reserve December 7 on your schedule.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Durga. Good afternoon and welcome, everyone. In Starbucks' 24 years of public life, I can't recall a quarter quite like Q3 of 2016, when a confluence of social and political turmoil at home, weakening consumer confidence, increasing global uncertainty, and the launch of one of our most significant long-term initiatives of all-time all occurred within a single earnings period. In light of these circumstances, it would not be unreasonable to simply celebrate another quarter of record revenues and record EPS, our first non-holiday quarter with $1 billion of operating income, and operating performance well above our competitive set and at the very top of our sector.", "But I want to address right out of the gate the two questions you're likely asking yourselves. Does a 4% positive same-store sales comp from our U.S. business in Q3 signify or even suggest a turning point in Starbucks' long-term growth trajectory? And does this comp figure in any way relate to the success and value of our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program? On today's call, we will demonstrate with clarity and specificity why our U.S. comps in Q3 were an anomaly, and that we have clear line of sight to returning our business to historic levels of comp growth, which has been at or above 5% for the past 25 consecutive quarters. We will demonstrate how the Starbucks Rewards program has been strengthened in Q3 and how the improvements will fuel an even more powerful digital flywheel that will propel our business forward for years to come. And we will share details around a number of exciting new developments as we head into Q4 and prepare for fall and holiday that demonstrate why we are so confident going into fiscal 2017, and why we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for each of our businesses around the world.", "That said, with candor and humility, we acknowledge that in certain areas, we did not execute as well as we could have in the U.S. in Q3. Had we done so, we certainly would have reported stronger U.S. comps. So let me try and put you in our shoes and take you through what actually occurred. Very early in the quarter, and after months of planning, we began executing against what I am convinced will prove to be among our boldest and most strategic moves ever, the strategic shift of our tremendously successful loyalty program from a frequency-based to a spend-based model. The shift was a one-time event, a once-in-a-decade change built on carefully vetted analysis that showed that a spend-based program would best reward our most loyal customers and encourage all of our customers to visit us more often and spend more on each visit, and it would be more fair for all of our customers as well.", "In addition, the shift would instantly eliminate a vexing in-store operating issue, order splitting, that was and has resulted in shorter lines, increased speed of service, and reduced line attrition. Now, given the sheer size, scale, and complexity of our Starbucks Rewards program and the mobile and digital technologies that support it, we knew there could be some hurdles to navigate at launch, particularly since the launch would coincide with the kickoff of our annual Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion, a nationwide event that typically ushers in the busiest time of year in our stores and consistently drives significant traffic and incremental revenue.", "By way of example, 2015's Frappuccino promotion drove a 30% increase in revenue over the prior year. You may recall that on last quarter's call, we cautioned that the launch of the new Rewards program could result in some noise in our comp figures as customers and partners adapted to the program changes. What we underestimated was the interdependence of Starbucks Rewards and Happy Hour, and that two powerful initiatives competing for partner and customer mind share during a discrete period of time would disrupt what should have been strong, positive interdependence and leverage.", "In hindsight, what we should have done was build customer awareness anticipation for the Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion as we have done so successfully in the past and given the promotion the breathing room it needed. At the same time, the Happy Hour promotion interfered with the results we were expecting from the Starbucks Rewards program launch.", "By anyone else's standards, our Rewards results have been outstanding. We entered nearly 2 million new members year-over-year, representing 18% growth, and 300,000 net new members in Q3 alone, a time of year when we often see flat to negative membership growth. And we now have 12.3 million active Reward members in the U.S. and millions more worldwide.", "We are already seeing the percentage of tender from Starbucks Rewards U.S. customers rise to 33% in Q3, up three full points from last year, continuing an established pattern in which revenue growth from Rewards customers typically outpaces revenue growth from non-Rewards customers. And we are seeing both incrementality of spend and increase in total profit per customer, both directly attributable to a customer's having joined the Rewards program. These powerful metrics bode extremely well for our business going forward, and having us continue to lean in and convert even more customers into the Rewards program.", "In the months ahead, we will be launching even more initiatives to fully leverage Rewards as incentives for customer behavior and to encourage greater ticket and attach. What we did not and could not have fully anticipated was the profound weakening in consumer confidence in Q3 that has caused sharp declines in QSR and restaurant traffic overall and has many of our competitors struggling with negative transaction comps. And as I have mentioned in the past, Starbucks is not immune to macro challenges that impact our competitors and retail overall. But as with weather, we will not hold these challenges out as excuses. Instead, we will successfully manage and navigate through them as we always have.", "So while we may have significantly outperformed the industry and our competitors in Q3, we did not fully overcome all of the headwinds to the extent that we, and you, are accustomed. And in this regard, we, and I, are Starbucks' harshest critics. But before rushing to judgment on what one quarter's U.S. comp means, let's think back just 90 days to our Q2 call. Then, and following some slowing in Starbucks' China business, and specifically in comps and traffic, some were proclaiming the demise of our China strategy and perhaps our China business overall. Yet, here we are just 90 days later, approaching 2,300 stores in over 100 cities in China, opening more than one store a day and posting stunning Q3 results, including 7% comps, almost all of that growth coming from increased traffic. Again, demonstrating the strength, relevancy, and resiliency of the Starbucks business and brand in China.", "As many of you have covered Starbucks for some time, you have seen us occasionally experience periods of slower growth in our U.S. business, only to see the business rebound with greater strength and vigor in the quarters that follow. This is precisely the pattern I personally believe you're going to see as we head into fiscal 2017 and beyond.", "Perhaps the best evidence of the strength and resilience of Starbucks' business and brand is the robust performance of our newest class of retail stores, both in the U.S. and around the world. Record AUVs and record profits, with both growing and causing no net cannibalization of existing stores in the same trading area.", "This consistently strong performance drove our decision to open 1,900 net new stores around the world and over 600 alone in the U.S. in fiscal 2016, a pace of new store openings that we will be increasing both in the U.S. and around the world in 2017 and beyond.", "A few words on the great strides we made in Q3 against plans to expand our cold proprietary beverage platform and to elevate and further create premiumization at the very highest end of the coffee industry and create further separation from competitors. Our proprietary Cold Brew platform was nothing short of a runaway success in Q3, adding incrementality and driving attach, particularly in the afternoon daypart, and Nitro has been so well received in the stores it's in today that we are now accelerating the national rollout.", "And we are delighted to announce the opening of two new Starbucks Roasteries, one in Shanghai opening in 2017 and one in New York opening in 2018. Both are now under construction. Just as with our Seattle Roastery, each of the Shanghai and New York Roasteries will showcase the newest coffee brewing methods and offer consumers the finest assortment of exclusive micro-lot coffees from around the world in a complete, immersive coffee experience like none in the world and advance our plans to build 500 plus new format coffee forward Starbucks Reserve stores in key markets around the world. And the new Roasteries will be offering an elevated artisanal food experience through our new exclusive relationship with the renowned Italian bakery and caf\u00e9 operator, Princi.", "In a few moments, Kevin will take you through individual segment operating performance in Q3 and provide some color around the positive momentum we are seeing as we enter Q4 and prepare for holiday, and he'll introduce you to personalization, our new one-to-one personalized marketing capability that I strongly believe will prove to be a retail industry game changer, unlocking even more digital flywheel potential and driving even more growth in our business in the quarters and years ahead.", "Then Scott will take you through the financials in detail and provide Q4 guidance, and then we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "As we continue to work to achieve our aspirational goal of becoming a great, enduring company, we are reminded that Starbucks' greatest strength and its greatest asset remains its people. This has always been and always will be the case.", "Credit for our ability to post record revenues, margins, and profits in Q3 over a very strong Q3 last year and still achieve the upper-end of our Q3 EPS target range, despite less than expected sales lift from our U.S. Retail business, goes to our dedicated in-store partners who continue to serve our customers with the warmth and welcome that are the unique hallmarks of the Starbucks brand and the experience. Our Starbucks partners have my respect and my appreciation for all they do each and every day.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.", "Kevin R. Johnson - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. These record financial and operating results demonstrate the strength and relevance of the Starbucks brand around the world. This quarter was an anomaly, and while we are not pleased with the U.S. comp result, we understand the drivers and have a clear action plan already in motion.", "Our Summer 2 marketing campaign launched earlier this month, and we are seeing positive customer reception. We are experiencing good early results from our personalized digital marketing, with more customer-focused enhancements to our mobile app in the pipeline, and execution across our seven core strategies for growth continues with progress in each initiative linked to growth.", "On today's call, I will provide an overview of segment performance, update you on the Summer 2 campaign, and highlight some key digital flywheel initiatives. Let's start with the Americas segment. Our Americas business, with over 8,800 company operated and 6,400 licensed stores operating in 16 countries, delivered 4% comp growth on top of 8% comp growth in Q3 of last year.", "This resulted in record Q3 revenues up 7% over prior-year. We're on track to open 750 net new stores in the Americas in fiscal 2016, and our new classes of stores continue to outperform and deliver record-setting profitability in AUV sales.", "Our U.S. business delivered 4% comp growth and 8% revenue growth in the quarter. Howard highlighted the fact that the one-time transition to the new Rewards program in Q3 required marketing and field resources, which disrupted the normal cadence of our Summer 1 campaign and impacted Frappuccino momentum in the quarter. This was reflected in our same-store comparable with core beverages, excluding blended, contributing two points of comp, Food contributing one point of comp; and our Teavana and refreshment platforms contributing one point of comp each.", "Overall, our U.S. business grew in every daypart with the morning being our fastest-growing daypart. Morning was driven by the combination of increased Mobile Order & Pay transactions, strong performance from our core brewed and espresso product line-up, and breakfast sandwiches, which grew 20% year-on-year. We continued to successfully execute our strategy of elevating and growing our cold beverage platform. Iced beverage revenues, excluding blended, grew 25% year-on-year. We expanded our Cold Brew coffee platform through the successful launch of the Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew, and we're excited by the prospects for our cold coffee beverage lineup, including Iced Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato, and Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew. Teavana handcrafted beverages continue to resonate with customers, as iced tea sales increased 30% in the quarter, led by Mango Black, Peach Green, and Passion Tango Herbal iced teas.", "Our refreshment platform has also shown strong growth, up 50% over prior year, driven by the rainbow drinks phenomenon. The Pink Drink generated significant social media buzz and demonstrates the power of customer-driven innovation. Our Summer 2 campaign is now focused on the broader cold coffee and tea beverages, and we're off to a good start.", "Our Food platform continues to build and drive attach. In Q3, Food grew 10% and contributed one point of comp. While the comp growth has slowed, Food is at a record 20% of total sales. We actually saw an increase in attach. Our new Power Lunch has been well received as a convenient, personalized lunch offering, which is increasing customer awareness of our lunch and snack options.", "Let's now move on to China/Asia Pacific. Starbucks China/Asia Pacific region delivered another quarter of strong performance with year-on-year revenue and operating income growth of 18% and 22%, respectively. Comp sales in CAP increased 3% in the quarter, with China comp accelerating to 7%. Japan comps were positive but impacted by the recent earthquakes and ongoing economic challenges in the country. Profitability in Japan remains strong. We're optimistic about the long-term potential in the country. We now operate over 6,100 stores in 15 markets across CAP, including more than 2,200 stores in over 100 cities throughout Mainland China.", "Noteworthy is that despite moderated GDP growth in China, Starbucks China business was very strong, particularly in our largest cities. The acceleration of comp sales to 7% in the quarter was driven by 6% transaction growth, reinforcing that we are reaching new customers, as well as increasing the frequency of existing customer visits. Our newest China stores continue to deliver record-breaking volume and profit, and we remain committed, and we're on plan to increase our store count to over 3,400 in China and to over 10,000 in CAP overall by the end of fiscal 2019.", "Our loyalty program is the cornerstone of our digital flywheel, and CAP now has over 19 million Starbucks Reward members, with over 10 million in China alone. We recently launched mobile payment in China, leveraging the Starbucks mobile app with Starbucks stored value cards linked to Rewards. In Japan, we launched our first-ever Starbucks mobile app, giving customers the ability to pay for their purchases and send eGifts. We're extremely pleased by the rapid adoption of the mobile app in Japan. Our China/Asia Pacific business continues to perform well, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.", "Let's now move on to EMEA. EMEA continues to execute against a strategy to achieve an appropriate balance between company-operated and licensed stores. This is enabling us to grow our store footprint more rapidly, while expanding underlying operating margin over time. While the reported revenue decline in EMEA was 7%, when you adjust for the transfer of company-owned stores to licensed stores and for FX, which together impacted revenue by 12 points, revenue growth was 5%. We opened 92 new stores in the quarter and we've successfully transitioned our company-operated stores in Germany to our licensed partner, AmRest. Following this transition, 79% of the 2,565 stores throughout EMEA are now licensed.", "System comps across our EMEA business grew 2% in the quarter. A slow-growth European economy, Brexit, a weakened British pound, and ongoing security concerns throughout the region have contributed to consumer uncertainty throughout Europe. Our brand continues to hold up well in this challenging environment. We continue to see strength in the morning daypart from espresso growth and breakfast sandwich attach. In addition, the recent launch of the Teavana Shaken Iced Tea platform in Starbucks stores across 32 EMEA countries has exceeded our most optimistic projections. Featuring core beverages, including Peach Green Tea Lemonade, Classic Iced Tea and Iced Tea Lemonade available in black, green or hibiscus, the initial reaction from customers has been fantastic. We continue the global rollout of Teavana at Starbucks in most CAP markets later this quarter.", "Let's move on to Channel Development. Channel Development had a very strong Q3, with sequential acceleration of revenue growth to 9%. Operating income grew by 31% year-on-year, with each of the U.S. CPG, international CPG, and foodservice channels contributing to these outstanding results. Both the Starbucks Roast and Ground and Starbucks K-Cup platforms grew dollar share and maintained share leadership in the quarter. Our K-Cups business posted a strong dollar share growth of 13.3%, which was almost twice the category growth overall and gained just under a full point of share. With a 15.8% share, Starbucks is the number one brand on the K-Cup platform for the fourth consecutive quarter. Starbucks Roast and Ground continues to be the number one premium packaged coffee brand, with dollar sales growth of 8%, also roughly twice the category growth in the quarter overall, and gained just under one full point of share. Once again, our foodservice business led the industry, posting 6% growth, driven by strength in sales from national customers and the Office Coffee channel.", "Turning to Ready-to-Drink, our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo posted excellent results in the quarter. System sales, as measured by IRI, grew 11%, translating into a 1% share gain, bringing Starbucks to 13.3% of the total liquid coffee plus energy segment. And we are very excited about the prospects for our new Cold Brew Ready-to-Drink coffee launched just this month. Premium Ready-to-Drink tea is the fastest-growing segment in the tea category, growing 16% CAGR over the past five years and now generating an addressable market of $1.1 billion in sales.", "In Q3, we announced our entry into this new category through a new partnership with Anheuser-Busch. The Teavana Ready-to-Drink product line will offer consumers premium flavor options currently available to consumers only at Starbucks and Teavana retail stores. Teavana Ready-to-Drink teas will launch regionally in the first half of calendar year 2017 and expand across the U.S. over time.", "We continue to build our global CPG footprint. In the quarter, we began shipping Ready-to-Drink products within Latin America in partnership with PepsiCo. In Europe, we are on track for a fall launch of Starbucks Nespresso-compatible capsules in the U.K. and France. In partnership with Tingyi, we are tracking to launch Ready-to-Drink products in China by the end of calendar year 2016. The Channel Development segment continues to perform extremely well.", "Before handing over to Scott, I want to close with just a brief update on our digital flywheel. Having successfully navigating transitioning customers to the new program, we are now positioned to further accelerate program growth with a structure conducive to greater innovation and expansion. During the time of year when we typically see little, if any, program growth, we grew active membership to 12.3 million members. With strong retention across all customer segments, the vast majority of these customers now use our mobile app as the payment vehicle, accounting for approximately 25% of all transactions.", "Mobile Order & Pay was deployed less than one year ago and now represents nearly 5% of total U.S. transactions, close to 20% of all mobile payment at Starbucks. But that doesn't tell the entire story. When you look at our busiest stores at peak, when Mobile Order & Pay is most valuable to our customers and most effective at unlocking capacity in our stores, we see an even more impressive trend. In more than 2,700 stores across the U.S., Mobile Order & Pay represents more than 10% of total transactions at peak. In several hundred of those U.S. stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents more than 20% of transactions at peak.", "Adoption and usage continue to grow, and the upside is significant, as it is helping our customers and partners in our busiest stores at peak. We continue to make progress on app improvements that includes menu functionality and response time, while enabling new features, including favorite stores, favorite items, favorite orders, and personalized recommendations, most of which will be released over the next three months.", "Over the next several years, we will continue to enhance and expand personalization, both in our app and in other digital channels. We are now driving personalized offers through e-mail, which are yielding extremely encouraging results. We are building a true, real-time, personalization capability which will begin to power personalized experiences and communications within our app. The digital flywheel is a powerful asset, with a clear innovation roadmap.", "In closing, we have navigated the onetime event of transitioning to the new Starbucks Rewards program and our actions going forward are clear. Drive the Summer 2 marketing campaign around cold, enable the next wave of digital innovation and personalization, and continue to execute against our seven core strategies for growth.", "I'll now hand over to Scott Maw to take you through the financials. Scott.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' third quarter results, once again, reflect strong revenue and profit growth, although below recent trends. For the first time in our history, consolidated operating income exceeded $1 billion in a non-holiday quarter, increasing 9% over last year despite a full point of negative impact from foreign exchange.", "Operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 19.5% on a GAAP basis, and 19.8% on a non-GAAP basis, both new Q3 records. Margin improvement was driven by sales leverage and favorability in cost of sales that more than offset the impact of ongoing partner and digital investments, primarily related to our Americas segment.", "On a GAAP basis, EPS increased 24% to $0.51 in Q3, and on a non-GAAP basis, EPS increased 17% to $0.49. Noteworthy is that non-GAAP EPS in Q3 excludes the impact from the net gain resulting from the sale of our business in Germany to an existing licensed partner and an incremental tax benefit related to certain additional domestic manufacturing deductions for periods prior to FY 2016.", "Additionally, non-GAAP EPS continues to exclude certain costs related to our purchase of Starbucks Japan discussed on prior earnings calls. You can see the amount, timing, and description of each of these non-GAAP items in the detailed reconciliation table provided at the end of the earnings release. Please review that table in conjunction with our results.", "I'll now take you through the operating performance of each of our major segments in Q3. Americas' Q3 operating income grew to a new third quarter record of $899 million, a 5% increase over the prior year quarter. Operating margin, while declining 40 basis points year-over-year, remains strong at 24.6%. In addition to the details Kevin provided on U.S. comps, we did see nearly one point of transaction splitting impact during the quarter following the Starbucks Rewards launch. This is consistent with our previous estimate we provided and impacts both ticket and transaction by about one point.", "Store partner and digital investments increased in Q3, impacting operating margin by 140 basis points. Included in that figure is 90 basis points of impact related to a $30 million onetime cash award for tenured U.S. Retail hourly store partners. The impact of these investments was partially offset by sales leverage and savings in cost of sales.", "Given our Q3 results and outlook for Q4, we expect operating margin in fiscal 2016 for the Americas to increase slightly over fiscal 2015.", "Let's move on to our China/Asia Pacific segment. Our China/Asia Pacific segment delivered its highest-ever quarterly operating income in Q3, $183 million on a GAAP basis, representing a 22% increase year-over-year, and an 80 basis point increase in operating margin to 23.8%, as the segment benefited from higher income from our joint venture operations and increased sales leverage, partially offset by a negative 130 basis point impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, CAP margins expanded by 210 basis points in Q3. For the year, we now see CAP operating margins expanding slightly over last year, an increase from our most recent guidance given our strong operating performance in the region.", "Let's move on to EMEA. EMEA's operating margin declined 130 basis points in Q3 compared to last year, to 10.9%, largely due to the sale of our Germany retail operations, driven by costs related to the sale of 110 basis points. While licensed store profitability continues to improve, EMEA is facing significant ongoing economic and geopolitical headwinds. As a result, we now see fiscal year 2016 operating margin roughly equal to last year.", "Our Channel Development segment once again delivered very strong performance and results in Q3. Channel Development operating income reached a new quarterly record of $188 million, up 31% over last year, as operating margin increased 710 basis points in the quarter to 42.6%, driven primarily by favorability in coffee costs, lower marketing spend, higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi, and leverage on cost of sales.", "Year-to-date, our North American Coffee Partnership has grown its operating income contribution by a remarkable 33%, reflecting strong demand for core bottled beverages such as Frappuccino and the success of innovative new products. Given the performance to-date, we now expect strong operating margin expansion for Channel Development with the full year 2016 in line with the segment's Q3 year-to-date margin.", "I want to take a moment to comment specifically on our Q3 tax rate, because it came in lower than our expectation and yours. Our reported Q3 effective tax rate of 29.7% included several items worth mentioning. As noted in the non-GAAP reconciliation at the end of our earnings release, we recorded a true-up related to a specific domestic manufacturing tax benefit in the quarter, and also the net gain from the Germany sale, the majority of which was non-taxable. These items had a favorable 260 basis point impact on the tax rate. The remaining net favorability, which was not included as a non-GAAP adjustment, related to various other items that we recorded during the quarter. We do not anticipate that the benefit from most of these items will recur in Q4.", "I'd like to cover in some detail our expected performance for Q4 given our Q3 results, particularly in connection with our U.S. Retail business and the impact of the 53rd week. For Q4, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.54, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.54 to $0.55 including the impact of the 53rd week that will add roughly $0.06 to the quarter. I want to underscore that the $0.06 is our best estimate of the 53-week contribution. Forecasting the impact of a single week out of a year with complete precision given the size and scale of our global business is challenging at best.", "For our fiscal 2016, our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.88 to $1.89, including the $0.06 for the 53rd week, and we are reiterating our non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.88 to $1.89, including the $0.06 for the 53rd week, consistent with prior guidance. On a 52-week basis, non-GAAP EPS growth represents 15% to 16% over the prior year, our seventh straight year of at least 15% non-GAAP EPS growth.", "We now expect global comp growth of 5% for Q4 and mid-single-digit comp growth globally for fiscal year 2016. This includes some anticipated improvement in Q4 U.S. comps from Q3 levels. On a 52-week basis, we now expect consolidated revenue growth of approximately 10%, with the 53rd week adding approximately two points and one point of negative impact from FX.", "For the full year, foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact consolidated operating income growth by approximately two points. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect investments in our partners and digital initiatives globally to be between $275 million and $300 million, compared to approximately $145 million in fiscal 2015. We continue to expect consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2016 to increase slightly relative to 2015 on both GAAP and non-GAAP bases, reflecting sales leverage and increased operating efficiency and performance, partially offset by the impact of increased partner and digital investments.", "Moving on to commodities, with 2016 coffee needs fully priced, we still expect to see a slightly favorable impact for the year, and we are now over 50% price locked for fiscal 2017. We will update you on the projected 2017 impact of coffee costs in conjunction with our overall initial 2017 guidance next quarter.", "Given the strong operating results we're generating from our new stores, particularly in our largest markets such as the U.S. and China, we now expect to add approximately 1,900 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, up from our previous guidance, including 750 in Americas, 900 in China/Asia Pacific, and 250 in EMEA. I want to emphasize that we are seeing no change in the strong profitability or growth trajectory of our new stores. We now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 33%, and we still expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016.", "Consistent with the timing of targets for the current fiscal year, we will be providing our initial growth target for fiscal 2017 during our fourth quarter earnings call. You will recall that a year ago we made the decision to shift providing guidance to Q4 in order to have the time necessarily to fully vet and finalize our annual operating plan for the subsequent year.", "As Howard mentioned, Q3 was an unusual quarter, characterized by very strong results from both China/Asia Pacific and Channel Development but challenged top line results in the U.S. due to less than expected sales lift from the launch of the new Starbucks Rewards program and Frappuccino Happy Hour and the high bar to clear from Q3 of last year. Yet despite this challenge and because of the dedication and commitment of our store partners around the world, we delivered another solid quarter and record revenues and profit.", "Our path forward is clear. We are confident in the correctness of the strategic, operational and digital moves we outlined today, and remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver the long-term profitable growth that you have rightfully come to expect. We're looking forward to sharing more of our plans around reimagined store designs and new store formats, coming mobile, digital, and loyalty innovations, new food and beverage offerings, and the many other initiatives underway at our Biennial Investor Day on December 7.", "Now I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you very much. Howard, I was wondering if maybe you could give some historical context. You've seen periods of weaker consumer confidence before. For me, the second quarter of 2012 kind of comes to mind and maybe late in 2014. And Starbucks has always been able to address it and re-accelerate comps. So could you maybe just talk about it in the context of what you're seeing now and your confidence in your ability to do that again similar to as you've done in prior years?", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you for the question. You know, let me say that I think we've been very fortunate over the years to be able to create the kind of product and experience that provides our customers with a sense of community and an emotional attachment that I think, over time, despite the conditions in the marketplace and the economic pressures, have been very inviting for our customers. I say that because I think what we are experiencing to-date is something different. And before anyone rushes to judgment what I mean by that, let me explain it.", "I think we have a situation where you have a very uncertain election. You have domestic civil unrest with regard to race. And I think the issues around terror have created a level of anxiety. And so, we're no longer looking at just an economic downturn. There are a number of things that we are facing as citizens, and I think the direction of the country.", "And so, I think this is a multi-prong issue that almost every company and every consumer brand is facing as a result of what I've just described. As I said in my prepared remarks, though, we, at Starbucks, look at this not as an excuse but feel very strongly that what we offer our customers, the sense of community, the longing for human connection, a safe place, an affordable luxury and, obviously, the innovation that we have brought forth gives us the confidence that we will be the kind of company and the kind of brand that will demonstrate to our customers the aspirational connection.", "And I think also it's very \u2013 I know this is a long-winded answer, but it's important. So much of what we've been able to do over the years is linked to the equity of the brand which is linked to the experience. That experience comes to life with our people. The investments we continue to make with our people are as important as anything we are doing to overcome the challenge and the headwinds that I've just described.", "In addition to that, I think the social impact initiatives that we have brought forth over the last couple of years has created a level of trust and confidence in the brand, in the experience, I think, that demonstrates that our ability to navigate through this time and time again will give us the ability this time as well to put up the kind of numbers that Scott just described, and we will do everything we can to not only meet the guidance but, as we've done in the past, try and overachieve it.", "But no one should misinterpret or in any way look at the challenges that we and many, many other companies are facing as something that has been done before. This is quite unusual. It's unsettling. It's unnerving, and as a result of that, it requires an approach that is quite different than anything we've done before.", "But I must say that I'm confident that the team, the leadership, the field, the equity of the brand, the innovation, what Kevin has described in digital, all of these things, coupled with the offset of being able to create the kind of business in Asia, and specifically China, which gives us the ability to offset some of the concerns that are going on in the U.S. and create the kind of business in China that one day \u2013 and I've said this in the past \u2013 will be as large or larger than the U.S.", "And as a result of that, we won't be as dependent on the domestic relationship we currently have. You look at the China business today, the growth, the revenue, the equity of the brand, the experience \u2013 for those people who haven't seen it, it's quite something to see after 17 years what we've been able to do there, and we are just getting started.", "When that Shanghai Roastery opens, it's going to be something that is going to probably be as strong an experience as what Disney has done recently in Shanghai.", "That's a very long-winded answer, and the short response is I am confident with cautious optimism that we will continue to be able to deliver despite the challenges I've just described.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Great. Thank you so much, and I do apologize if I missed this but, Howard, it's been my impression with all of the exceptional things that you do at the store level that not everyone is aware of things like the benefits of my Starbucks Rewards, and even some of your core customers don't necessarily realize the benefits that they get from mobile ordering, given that 5% of transactions are currently mobile ordering. So everyone knows what Starbucks is in the United States, but is there an awareness opportunity for you to communicate directly, indirectly, in the Starbucks way, some of the key attributes that does make it different that perhaps gives us an opportunity as we think about 2017?", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. One second. Here is Matt Ryan, who is going to take that.", "Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer", "Thank you, John, for the question. You're absolutely right. We do have an opportunity there. When we look over time, there are a lot of customers who are not aware of the benefits of the Rewards program. There are a lot of customers who have not joined it yet there. There are a lot of customers who don't know about Mobile Order & Pay and the tremendous benefits.", "We're very fortunate that we have that in front of us, so we're leaning in constantly. We've seen a lot more recruitment of members in our stores this year. You're going to continue to see that, and you're going to continue to see us lean in hard on Mobile Order & Pay, continuing to improve the experience and showing people just how good it can be.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC. Your line is open.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi. Thanks. With regard to Food growth, you mentioned that it was perhaps not quite as strong as it was in previous quarters. Do you think you're reaching near-peak levels of Food attachment? Or is this just quarterly noise? And relatedly, from a menu composition standpoint, what do you think is perhaps the more exciting sales layers that you're pursuing currently? Thanks.", "Kevin R. Johnson - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah. This is Kevin, David, and then I'll hand it over to Cliff to give you some more background. I think we have not reached some level of saturation on how much we can grow Food. I think we've seen very good growth of our breakfast sandwich lineup. We're seeing increased attach of Food. I think if you look at each daypart, there are opportunities in every daypart for us to do more around Food, and I think we recognize that as one of our seven core strategies for growth and the work that we're doing, both in R&D and innovation and testing things in stores and markets, I think continues to present an opportunity.", "We did see Food contribute one point of comp growth this quarter. I think in prior quarter I think it was at two points of comp growth. So we're still seeing good comp growth coming from Food, and there's more we can do there. Cliff, I'll let you add some more to that.", "Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region", "Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. And, David, it's great to see the strength and the continued growth on breakfast sandwiches, and that morning daypart just continues to get stronger and stronger. The opportunity is to provide choice, variety and a competitive approach around lunch and later dayparts. And we've started our journey, and if I remember back rolling out breakfast sandwiches I think took us several years, and the growth we've seen since we've brought in the baked goods at La Boulange and the enhancements to the quality and the choice of breakfast sandwiches gives me every confidence that we will continue on this journey, 20% of our sales now coming from Food, it's a great opportunity for the future, and we're working hard on it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much. You recently announced that you were going to raise wages in the U.S. by between 5% and 15%. So I'm just wondering, I know you don't talk about 2017 yet, but it begs the question since you brought it up at least in discussing that, what is the cost of that in dollars? What are the expenses that roll off this year that might help offset that? And can you fund that kind of investment in the context of 15% to 20% earnings growth? Any help there would be greatly appreciated.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, John. It's Scott. I think the first thing I would say is the vast majority of that investment that we announced recently was already in our initial plans for 2017. And both those investments and any other investments that we choose to do as we move into next year, we'll talk about during the next earnings call, but I want to make sure both the performance this quarter, the guidance next quarter, the investments we're making, there is no wavering in our commitment to deliver at least 15% EPS growth every year, and that is true for 2017. So we'll get into more specifics, but as comp growth reaccelerates, as we take a look at additional investments, as we lap over investments that we make this year, the sum of all of that will be at least 15% earnings growth.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And let me add something qualitatively to that. Because of the degree of frequency that the average customer has to their core store, their home store, whether it's at work or at home, there is a relationship that is built between the barista, the manager, and the customer. And we know from our own research that anything that we can do that lowers attrition, that creates a relationship with our customers and the people who are proudly wearing the green apron, that performance that you've seen year in, year out, is directly related. So what we want to try and do is really get ahead of any federal or state mandate to be the employer of choice, whether we go back to the late 1980s with Bean Stock and healthcare, and what we've done in the last couple of years with college achievement, and now what we're doing now on wages, we want to try and do everything we can to share success, because we know that the brand of Starbucks is directly related to the experience in our stores and our brand, unlike almost any consumer brand or retail stores directly linked to the pride and the trust that our people have in the company.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open.", "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good afternoon. I have a clarification question and then another question. First, on the clarification side, when you say, Howard, that you have line of sight into comps improving, is that meant to be a signal that you're already seeing that in July? Or you're expecting that to happen in the balance of the quarter? So if you could help to clarify that, that would be great. And then I think there was a reference to better leveraging the new Rewards program as you move forward. If you could just elaborate on what you're planning there and if that's something we should expect to see in the current quarter or as we move into next year.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think it would not be responsible to comment on the first 21 days of the quarter with regard to where comps are, but I think those of you who have been covering the company all these years in our public life of 24 years, we do not have a habit of giving guidance that we don't believe we can achieve. So take it on face value that Scott said that comps are going to improve in the quarter, and we believe that's going to be true.", "Kevin R. Johnson - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah. And then, David, in terms of your question on better leverage of the Rewards program and the digital flywheel, I'll give you three dimensions in which I think we have an opportunity to better leverage that asset. Number one is continued geographic deployment. We talked about what we did this last quarter in Japan and China as examples, and the more we take the Rewards program and the mobile app on our digital flywheel to other geographies, that's one way to leverage. The second is growing the number of customers that we have in the Rewards program, and Matt Ryan highlighted that as a big opportunity, and that's one piece of it. And then the third is the way that we deepen the engagement with the existing customers in the Rewards program, and that's done through a combination of the work we're doing around personalization, and it's also done through the work we're doing to incent things like a trial of Mobile Order & Pay. I think we've got some number of customers that have tried Mobile Order & Pay. And statistically, when we look at \u2013 once a customer tries Mobile Order & Pay once, it's a very sticky feature. Once they try it once, they start using it regularly. The vast majority of them do.", "So those are three dimensions. And I'm going to hand over to Matt Ryan to talk a little bit more about the personalization work we're doing, but those are three dimensions that we are going to use to leverage that asset. And, Matt, to you on personalization.", "Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer", "Thanks, Kevin. I think the one thing I would add here is there's a direct linkage between the changes we made in our Rewards program and our ability to launch personalization moving forward. As you know, the past program only rewarded frequency. We couldn't reward any other behavior but that. We now have the opportunity, both in e-mail, which we've just begun, and this quarter, in our app, to do suggested selling. So we will be suggesting and making personalized offers within the context of our app that will allow people to see things that are right for them.", "In the year to come, you'll see more of this in the context of ordering. So at the moment, when somebody is there, we'll be able to suggest items that are additional purchases and reward that with a currency that now rewards not only frequency but also spend. So connecting the dots there you can see how this will build on itself and give us leverage to drive the total customer sales.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.", "Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you. I've noticed a heightened level of Star Dash e-mails since the MSR transition, and this obviously isn't Starbucks-specific as the whole industry's promotional intensity has increased. But I'm curious as you think about improved trends in 4Q, is this taking into consideration weaning off these promotions, or given the fragile consumer environment Howard noted earlier, if a heightened level of promotions remains necessary near-term? Thanks.", "Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer", "Matt Ryan here again. I that what I'd like to call attention to that what you're actually seeing are more personalized and relevant communications. So very late in the quarter, we turned on, what we call, one-to-one marketing. It's actually close to one-to-30, but we are getting down to the level of personalized rewards based upon what people actually will do and knowledge we have of that individual customer's behavior. Previously, we sent e-mails to very large segments of customers. Now, we're able to do it on a very targeted basis, and what that allows us to do is to be more efficient and more effective with our communications so that we don't have to peanut butter a broad discount. We can go in more selectively and offer just what's right to get the next incremental level of engagement with us.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me add one other thing that I think is very important. If you think what the size and scale of the national footprint of Starbucks and the amount of stores we have, we've achieved something that is quite rare and unique, and that is we've achieved a level of ubiquity in terms of our scale and national footprint and, at the same time, without question, a premium position in the marketplace. That is as a result of a very disciplined and thoughtful view of how to build and maintain a premium brand.", "What we saw this past quarter and, for that matter, even beyond that, was given the challenges that exist in the marketplace that we've all seen and discussed, there is a tremendous amount of discounting and promotion going on in the market where people are buying business. We do not want to be in the business of buying business. We do not want to discount or dilute the integrity of the brand. We know who we are. We know what our core purpose is. And we've got to play the long game and have faith and confidence in what we stand for in terms of the experience, the quality of the coffee.", "What we keep talking about really internally is we want to take the equity of the brand and the position of Starbucks up. The premiumization of Starbucks is linked to the Roasteries and linked to this new format of stores that we are working on that you'll begin to see in calendar 2017 which is Starbucks Reserve which, in a way, is like a cousin in a smaller format of the Roastery. All of that will shine a halo on the brand, shine a halo on the experience, and we don't want to do anything that would dilute that halo by buying business or discounting, and we're not going to get in that game, despite the fact that so many other people are throwing that at us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah. Thanks. Just going back to the kind of broader margin outlook here, you guys have made some significant investments in the partners and technology over the last two years. I think there's a perception out there that as you roll into next year, you'll be able to lap some of those investments and perhaps will give you some room to let a little more margin flow to the bottom line. Can you kind of address your thoughts on that perception that's out there? Is that the right way to think about it? Or are we just in the earlier stages of these types of investments and you expect them to continue into next year, particularly given the labor environment that we have today?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Jason. This is Scott. What we said in the past is the significant investment started in 2014. They ramped in 2015, and we increased them again in 2016. And I think that, as we look ahead to 2017 and we start to put together our plan, I think there will be another significant level of investment in our partners in particular. We announced some of those recently. They're vital to driving the right level of retention, the right level of customer execution, as Howard talked about. So I think looking forward to 2017, you can see \u2013 I can see another significant amount of investments and also on the digital front. So as you look at the things that Matt talked about, the ability to drive personalization, we see an additional opportunity there.", "So I don't think we're in the early innings, but it will probably continue for a number of years as we continue to drive digital innovation and we continue to drive the right level of investments in stores and partners. But what I think is important is that doesn't have any impact on our long-term guidance of at least 15% earnings growth, 10% profit growth, and as a result, margin expansion. I just think we're investing more of that margin into our core partner and digital investments.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Thank you. My question is just tell us more about Channel Development, but what I was hoping you would comment on is I know dollar growth was up 9%, but how does volume growth compare? And then I was looking back in my model and historically the fourth quarter for the past few years is the highest operating margin quarter. So is there any reason that wouldn't hold true for this year? And the final part of that is, is everything in that's been renegotiated or added in this quarter such that it's a sustainable peak? Or do you think just in any timeframe in the future, it could be even higher? Thank you so much.", "Michael Conway - President, Starbucks Global Channel Development", "Thank you, Nicole. This is Mike Conway. So you're right, the 9% growth actually is quite, quite strong. We're pleased with that, and I would say that the combination of our strong in-store execution, the strong distribution that we've been able to have, the strength in general that we're seeing in foodservice is all contributing to that.", "As I look at volume, I'd say our volume growth was a little bit higher than that, but not much, and I think the combination of our base and promotive pricing has been able to deliver both the kind of margin expansion that we want to see as well as the share improvements that we would see.", "As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we feel very good about the innovation that we have coming. We've got our Cold Brew that is coming in our ready-to-serve segment. We also have our new Caff\u00e8 Latte launch that is in our K-Cup format. That is going to be launched in the fourth quarter. And then on a global basis, we have a lot of new initiatives that are coming, particularly in the ready-to-drink and single-serve segments with our Nespresso launch in EMEA. So we feel good about the quality of our growth in the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter we also feel good about as well. And I'll let Scott take the margin expansion question.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "On the fourth quarter Channel Development margin, it will be the highest quarter again for us this year, and it will expand over last year's Channel Development margin and expand over this quarter's margin. There's a lot of good things, as Mike talked about, that will impact that quarter.", "And what I would say to the second part of your question, Nicole, is we continue to forecast, as we move through time, margin expansion in Channel Development. It won't be 710 basis points very many quarters. This was unusual and excellent, but we do expect channel operating income to grow faster than revenue growth, and that will drive margin expansion as we move into 2017.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Can I take you back to the effects of the Rewards program on the quarter? If you could just walk through in a little more detail how you think it disrupted some of the other things you that may have typically done. And maybe tie into that just customer acceptance. I mean, I know the membership is up quite big, but just sort of customer acceptance of the new program.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Joe, this is Howard. I think Kevin is going to take the bulk of the question. But I think ask yourself rhetorically, with 25 consecutive quarters of 5% or greater, if we did not have the confluence of the Rewards program and the Frappuccino launch at the same time, what would comps have been for this quarter? And I can tell you unequivocally that we know internally that this was an anomaly as a result of what I described in my prepared remarks. Now, we own that from an execution standpoint because we underestimated what would take place. But if any of that did not exist, the comps in the quarter would not have been before that we have outlined in the release. And I think as a result of that, we feel very comfortable that things are going to improve. Kevin?", "Kevin R. Johnson - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah. Let me build on that, Joe. I think there's three primary drivers behind our Q3 results in the U.S. business. First, we launched Starbucks Rewards in mid-April, which impacted the timing of our annual Summer 1 campaign, and that Summer 1 campaign is what kicks off and launches our Frappuccino Happy Hour season.", "Now, in many ways, the Rewards launch went exactly as planned, with the vast majority of our customers excited about their ability to earn more rewards and with nearly 20% year-on-year growth in membership. Customers that could potentially be disadvantaged have not materially changed their behavior, and we're seeing increased lift in activity and early signs of success from the personalization efforts Matt described.", "So the launch of Rewards required a significant amount of cross-company focus from our marketing teams, store execution, our digital teams, and this included specific training and marketing in our stores. We trained our store partners on Rewards programs so they could explain it, and educate customers, and help them through that transition. We used our stores to market and launch the Rewards program. And in order to make room in the marketing calendar to do this training and launch it in our stores and communicate it to customers, we delayed our normal Summer 1 campaign launch by one week. So we launched it one week later than we did last year. And so this resulted in a slower launch or start to the Frappuccino Happy Hour. So that's number one.", "Second, and related, was the implication of having two major marketing campaigns, Rewards and our Frappuccino Happy Hour, running simultaneously. Let me give you some more context. Over time, we've seen a little bit of slowing in the afternoon and some of the blended products such as Frappuccino, but this quarter stands out with a negative 1% comp in blended. And as you know, Happy Hour is a significant event each May and makes that month the biggest month of the year for us in terms of total U.S. transactions. And because of the foundational importance of the new Rewards program and the need to connect with customers, we had to have the marketing message around Rewards and communicated and unfortunately having two major marketing messages running simultaneously, we didn't get as much traction behind Frappuccino Happy Hour. We didn't get as much social media buzz and that translated into not as many transactions.", "So launching it a week later and then have having two marketing messages simultaneously were the contributors. And then I think the potential third aspect that we acknowledge but can't quantify is the overall impact of customer sentiment. Given the significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many parts of world, and we believe consumer confidence has weakened.", "Now, industry-specific spending data for retail broadly, and for restaurants specifically would support that that's the case. And, we've navigated these situations in the past. And I think, as Howard articulated, this one may be a bit different. But, we think when we put these three factors together, this quarter was an anomaly. And I think that gives you a little bit of perspective and a little bit of color around the drivers. Cliff, do you want to add to that?", "Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region", "Yeah, Joe, it's Cliff. I think one of the things just to share, change is always difficult for both partners and customers. The frequency we have people coming into our stores and the relationship between the barista and the customer is absolutely key to our business. So we invested in a lot of fronts in making our partners ready for the change. The good news is we transferred and changed over the program virtually overnight. It was a very, very seamless transition.", "Functionality is great and growing, and the personalization just gives me so much confidence for the future. The opportunity now for us is to grow the awareness of the program with the existing customers about the benefits and personalization will really help with that. And then continue to grow the number of members in the program, and I think Mobile Order & Pay ties nicely into that. And as Kevin \u2013 I'm sorry, as Howard outlined earlier, the year-on-year growth on active members at 18%, taking us to 12.3 million, just gives us great confidence for the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.", "Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you. Just a little bit of a follow-up on that also with respect to looking back on the comp and just trying to understand the going-forward trends. I know there's been some publicity about the 1% price increase or about a $0.05 per beverage to come, and being taken. And I'm just curious as far as the way I understand it, two points for the core beverages in this quarter, one point for Food, one point for Teavana, so we're assuming then no price in 2Q \u2013 in fiscal 3Q and all of the reported then sort of 1% price increase would be incremental going forward?", "Kevin R. Johnson - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah, Matthew, one correction I want to add to your comp bridge that you just went through. There was also one point from the refreshment platform. There's one point from Teavana and one point from the refreshment platform. And so, if you add that up and you look inside, there was also then the negative point for blended, and that's how you get the bridge.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And what I would add to that, Matt, is Kevin's comp numbers include pricing for those categories. So on your broader pricing question, the first thing I want to make sure you realize is, as we take price, we look at very carefully using our elasticity models, as you know, we look at it by product, we look at it by geography, and we're very careful to be sensitive to significant changes to customer impact. We're really cognizant of that. And as we've done that over the years, including this year and the most recent pricing changes that we just made, we are not seeing any change in customer attrition. So that's not happening.", "And then to your core question. As you know over the last few years, we've had one point to two points of price in our comps every quarter. This quarter, in the third quarter, will fall into that one point to two point price range, and the fourth quarter will fall into that one point to two point price range. So there's no acceleration of comp pricing in the guidance that I gave.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I'm asking a little bit of the same question as you're looking from this quarter into sort of next quarter and then fiscal 2017. Where are the puts and the takes on the comp algorithm? Is it that Food can re-accelerate or particular categories or does a lot of it come down to this one-to-one marketing and more of a traffic or frequency-driven acceleration? Thanks.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I'll start and then if Matt wants to add. From a product standpoint, the first thing that's going to happen is blended sales will rebound. We obviously don't anticipate another negative 1% comp from blended. In addition, as we look at the Summer 2 platform that Kevin talked about with things like Iced Coconut Milk Macchiato and Mocha Macchiato and the early results from that are quite encouraging. We've got a number of things on the product lineup, Card, Nitro Cold Brew, as well as acceleration of some of the features within Mobile Order & Pay.", "So later this quarter, we'll get favorites of stores which will make it easier for people in New York and other dense areas to select and save favorite stores, favorite orders, makes it easier to save favorite orders. And when we look at broadly our innovation pipeline, digital product, things that we're doing in the stores with things like Nitro, marketing, there's just a significant amount of momentum already, and then that we have planned as we look forward. And as we get into 2017, the second part of your question, and Matt touched on this, we will further refine our personalization capability to have suggested selling one-to-one as you're building your order with relevant products based upon what you've ordered in the past, daypart, your preferences. So all of that is stacked up, and that's what makes us think we can get to 5% at least as we get into Q4 and try to accelerate as we go into 2017.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "There's one more I think significant opportunity. Cliff, do you want to talk about that?", "Clifford Burrows - Group President-Americas, US & Teavana Region", "Yeah, let me just talk, Karen, about a real opportunity that exists playing off or drafting off the work we've done at the Roastery here in Seattle, and that is an opportunity to elevate coffee to a new level within our stores. And that is showing up as a Reserve bar. And we've started to deploy Reserve bars and we will continue to grow that, and it will be a significant opportunity for us to elevate the handcrafted, the artisanal nature of the barista, and you'll start to see that showing up across the country. And that will introduce new beverages which are at a premium, and it will give customers an opportunity to try some of the incredible coffees that are roasted in our Roasteries, in our Roastery here in Seattle.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar. Your line is open.", "R.J. Hottovy - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Thanks. I had a follow-up question on the earlier question about better leverage in the Rewards program. Appreciate the geographic enrollment and personalization goals that you outlined as goals of better leverage in the program. But in the last quarter, you talked about opportunities such as the debit card, potentially the grocery store linkage and other partnerships like Lyft and New York Times as potentially a way to leverage the loyalty program. Just curious if we could get an update on that and the outlook for that the rest of this year and into 2017? Thanks.", "Matthew Ryan - Executive Vice President, Global Chief Strategy Officer", "Sure. Matt Ryan again here. We are actively at work on that. As you know, we've announced a significant partnership with Chase and there's a core product that we are just trying to figure out when to place on the calendar right now. We're not going to exactly commit to a date because we want to give it the right opportunity to launch across the next year.", "We're very excited about that, because when Kevin talked about the leveragability of a spend-based program as opposed to a frequency-based program, it allows us to do these kinds of things like award people for everyday spend. And right now it's simply a matter of execution and when we can get it on the calendar and give it the justice that it deserves from a timing perspective.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, thanks. And good afternoon, everybody. Wanted to ask about the global opportunity for expansion of packaged and single-serve coffee? And sort of the puts and takes of building it alone versus partnering with other folks? And then sort of related on the Channel Development business, how should we think about the ramp of the RTD coffee partnerships outside of the U.S. contributing to equity income going forward?", "Michael Conway - President, Starbucks Global Channel Development", "Thank you. Yeah, this is Mike. So as we look at our global opportunity for Channel Development, we've really focused on Ready-to-Drink as being the key driver versus packaged coffee, and a lot of that I think has to do with the strength that we've been able to create in our U.S. business with PepsiCo and the North American Coffee Partnership, and we think that's a more immediate opportunity.", "And you're right, the success for us is finding the right partners across the globe, and we have essentially done that as we look across our major markets. So within EMEA, we have a partnership with Arla that is quite strong, and we're building our business there in key markets.", "In Latin America, we just signed a deal with PepsiCo last year to strengthen the business within that region, and we're just starting to ship into new markets and into new channels within the region this quarter. And then within China/Asia Pacific, Japan and China being our key markets, we have key partnerships in Japan, which is our biggest market with Suntory, in Korea with Dong Suh Foods. And then, as we've talked, we have a partnership with Tingyi in China, where we are in the final phases of scaling up both the distribution and manufacturing so that we'll be in the market by the end of this year. So we feel good about the prospects for our Ready-to-Drink business across the globe, and we think that will be the really driver for Channel Development, at least in the near-term.", "Operator", "And that was our last question.", "Durga Doraisamy - Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you all very much for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing you on December 7 in New York City. Have a good afternoon, everyone.", "Howard S. Schultz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.

My name is Julie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Starbucks Company's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.", "Mr. Shaw, you may begin your conference.", "Thomas Shaw - Starbucks Corp.", "Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. This is Tom Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations at Starbucks Coffee Company. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results, which will be led by Howard Schultz, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Johnson, President and COO; and Scott Maw, our CFO. Joining us for Q&A are John Culver, Group President, Starbucks Global Retail; Cliff Burrows, Group President, Siren Retail; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; and Michael Conway, President of Global Channel Development.", "I'd like to remind everyone that our fiscal 2016 year had 53 weeks as opposed to the usual 52 weeks. This happens every six years as our fiscal year ends on the closest Sunday to September 30 and the extra week is reflected in our results for the fourth quarter. We'll be presenting our GAAP results for the 14-week quarter and 53-week full year, but some of our discussion will be on the non-GAAP basis, excluding the extra week. As a further reminder, non-GAAP earnings also continues to exclude certain costs related to our purchase of Starbucks Japan discussed on prior earnings calls. Please refer to the reconciliation table at the end of our earnings release and on our website at investor.starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with the corresponding GAAP measures.", "This conference call will also include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and our risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Howard Schultz. Howard?", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, Tom, and, Tom, welcome to Starbucks. This is your first conference call, wonderful to have you. And welcome to everyone on today's call.", "Starbucks record fiscal 2016 financial and operating results highlighted by an 11% increase in global revenues, a 17% increase in non-GAAP EPS and record operating margins despite persistent economic, consumer and geopolitical headwinds and the significant investments we continue to make in our people and our business and once again demonstrating the power, relevance and resilience of the Starbucks business and brand. Today, Starbucks is delivering an increasingly elevated Starbucks Experience to over 85 million customers through our 25,000 stores in 75 countries every week.", "The trust and confidence our customers have in the Starbucks brand is propelling our business forward in markets and channels around the world as never before. But our record performance does not yet reflect what may be the most important strategic developments since Starbucks first changed how the world consumes coffee. The initiatives we have underway that are elevating the Starbucks brand, transforming the customer experience and setting the foundation for the next wave of growth in our business, starting right now with holiday, with premiumization as a core defining theme.", "On today's call, I will provide context around several of these initiatives and open a window on exciting new innovations that are coming to life and will begin contributing to our sales and profits this year, and increasingly more so in the quarters and years ahead. And Kevin will provide highlights of our Q4 and fiscal 2016 operating performance, and Scott will take you through the details of our Q4 and fiscal 2016 financial performance and share our 2017 performance targets.", "Perhaps nowhere in the world has the Starbucks Experience come to life more powerfully and been embraced more enthusiastically than in China, a country we first entered 17 years ago. I personally observed this again firsthand on my visit to the market just two weeks ago. Starbucks stores in China are among our most elegant, efficient and profitable of any stores in the world, and China once again produced record revenues and profits and strong comp store sales growth in both Q4 and fiscal 2016.", "There are countless examples over the last decade of western companies and consumer brands that have tried but failed to achieve relevance in China. Not only has Starbucks cracked the code in China, consistently delivering record operating and financial performance, but our newest class of Starbucks stores in China is delivering the highest AUVs, ROI and profitability of any store class in our history in the market. And we have created partner pride and a deep emotional connection among our customers and our partners in the Starbucks brand in China that rivals any market in the world. By building the foundation of our business in China carefully, methodically and respectfully, we are creating a growth and profit engine that will continue to accelerate for decades to come.", "Now, as I have said before, we are doubling down on China. We currently operate roughly 2,400 Starbucks stores in 114 cities in China, and employ over 30,000 passionate partners. And because we have consistently invested ahead of the growth curve, we can continue to open over a store a day, a rate of growth that will continue or accelerate into the foreseeable future.", "We now have over 500 stores in Shanghai alone, a city of over 24 million people, making Shanghai the city in the world with more Starbucks stores than any other, and we continue to add stores. We remain on plan to have over 5,000 stores in China by 2021, and I am convinced that given the trust our customers in China have in the Starbucks brand and experience, and the loyalty they show us every day, in time, we will have more stores in China than we do in the U.S.", "These are the reasons we have chosen Shanghai as the city for our first international Starbucks Reserve Roastery. Roasteries define coffee premiumization and are the epitome of the Starbucks coffee authority and retail experience. And the portfolio of Roasteries we plan to open around the world will enable us to extend and elevate the Starbucks Experience and the Starbucks brand overall for decades to come.", "Opening in late 2017 on Nanjing Road, among the busiest shopping destinations in the world, the Starbucks Shanghai Roastery will be a stunning, two-level, 30,000-square-foot experiential destination showcasing the newest coffee brewing methods and offering customers the finest assortment of exclusive micro-lot coffees from around the world in an immersive, all-center experience emblematic of our Seattle Roastery, respectfully curating through a unique lens that will make it highly impactful and relevant to our Chinese customers.", "Starbucks business in China is only in its very early stages of development, but we are already ideally and uniquely positioned to grow and profit in this key long-term growth market as economic reforms take hold and the Chinese middle class grows ultimately to encompass over 600 million people. And following on the heels of the Starbucks Shanghai Roastery, we'll be opening Starbucks Roasteries in New York City and in Tokyo in 2018, and our first roastery in Europe in 2019 in a city to be announced early in 2017.", "Our decision to aggressively but thoughtfully and strategically expand our portfolio of Roasteries is supported by the one-of-a-kind, ultra-premium Reserve experience our Roasteries deliver to our customers, and the accelerating outperformance against plan we are experiencing in our Seattle Roastery, where full-year comp sales increased a full 24% over the prior year, thanks in large part to a ticket that has grown to be four times the ticket of a typical Starbucks store. But in addition to elevating the Starbucks brand and customer experience, our Seattle Roastery has also become a working laboratory for breakthrough innovation that is driving new product introductions and contributing to results across the entire Starbucks ecosystem.", "Nitro, for example, an innovative, new cold coffee beverage infused with nitrogen to create an ultra-creamy texture that has been enthusiastically embraced by our customers and is now being rolled out in coffee-forward markets across the country, was developed and tested in the Seattle Roastery. So too was Starbucks Affogato, our expression of a classic artisanal ice cream dessert infused with espresso, as well as handcrafted, proprietary Teavana iced teas and several other innovative new coffee-infused mixology beverages that are already showing great promise in test stores. Stay tuned.", "As with Starbucks Seattle Roastery, our Shanghai, New York and Tokyo Roasteries will serve as the foundation for the exciting, new-format, coffee-forward Starbucks Reserve stores. Also offering customers a range of artisanal food items, we plan to open around the world in the years ahead. The first of these new-format stores will open in the U.S. in the second half of our current fiscal year.", "And we are extending elements of the high-end roastery experience to include Reserve espresso bars in existing and new Starbucks stores as part of our plan to further elevate the overall Starbucks Experience. Customers' response to this initiative has been both very positive and very encouraging, as customers are trading up to premium espresso beverages.", "Still at the heart of all we do is our store partners, the best people in the industry. The investments we make in our people and in our business over the long-term is what drives the results we deliver quarter to quarter. The culture, the values and guiding principles of our company have always defined the brand. Consider our Starbucks College Achievement Plan, now in its third year, the Starbucks College Achievement Plan, a program that offers all Starbucks partners working 20 hours or more per week are given a company-paid, four-year online college education through our association with Arizona State University. The program now has over 6,200 partners enrolled, and we will celebrate 1,000 college graduates by the end of 2017.", "Partners participating in the College Achievement Plan have twice the retention rate and four times the promotion rate of our core U.S. barista population.", "The incremental investment in both wages and benefits for our store-level partners that we began making two years ago have been right not only from the perspective of sharing success, but also from the perspectives of enabling us to support and elevate our partners, attract and retain the best people, provide measured improvement in service to our customers and deliver outsized returns to our shareowners, due in part to an employee turnover rate that is the envy of our industry. We demonstrated this again in Q4 and in fiscal 2016, difficult environments for retailers by any measure. Yet here we are once again posting record performance, 11% top-line and 17% bottom-line for the year. Scott will update you on the size of the timing of our partner and other investments shortly.", "A few final thoughts before handing the call over to Kevin. Since its opening two years ago, our Seattle Roastery has become recognized as the most immersive coffee-forward retail experience in the world today, and it has cast a bright halo across the entire Starbucks brand and ecosystem. We knew from the start that the Roastery would introduce a previously unattained level of premiumization to the coffee category curated through the unique Starbucks lens. We also knew that the Roastery would support the development and rollout of Starbucks Reserve stores, a new retail format that we believe will deliver 2x the financial performance of a traditional Starbucks store and represent a new significant growth opportunity for the company domestically and around the world.", "But what we are achieving is much more than that. It's innovation and aspiration for the entire company and the beacon for the next wave of transformation that will elevate the entire Starbucks Experience. The Seattle Roastery is at once a laboratory for invention and handcrafted beverages, theater for coffee and the design cornerstone for new experience, like Reserve bars that over the next few years we'll incorporate into thousands of new and renovated stores.", "Given both the success of the Roastery itself and its impact on the entire Starbucks company, we see the opportunity over time for 20 Roasteries to 30 Roasteries in influential cities around the world, defining the way for 1,000 or more Starbucks Reserve stores, carrying through to Reserve bars in 20% or more of existing and new Starbucks stores. Together, these innovations will further deepen connection to our customers, increase AUVs, ROI and profitability, and drive incrementality through new premium occasions we currently do not capture.", "I am reminded of early days at Starbucks when we could foresee the transformation of coffee consumption that started in Seattle and spread all over the world. The scale of the opportunity, the confidence in our capability and the early validation we have all point to the next wave of growth for our company. In my years at Starbucks, I have never been more energized about the opportunity that lies ahead, and it's why Roasteries, Reserve stores and the premiumization of the Starbucks Experience will be my personal focus as we set up Starbucks for long-term growth and success.", "The Shanghai Roastery is just the next tangible proof of the innovation and the entrepreneurial DNA of the company as we take our customers in China on a magical carpet ride starting just a year from now. But you don't need to wait to see what's happening if you can't get to China, or, for that matter, Seattle, where we have our first Roastery. Please visit our new stores with Reserve bars at 10 Waverly Place, 9th and Broadway, Brookfield Place, and 85th and Madison in New York City or in Lake Forest, Illinois. You'll see for yourself how the experience is defining the transformation of these stores and the experience for our customers, and how accretive this will be for our brand and our business. Better yet, come to our Investor Conference in December where we will be showcasing the Roastery, the evolution of the Starbucks Reserve brand, and demonstrating the impact that each of these stores will have on the Starbucks Experience and the future transformation of the company.", "I'll now turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, Howard. Good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks' strong performance in Q4 capped off another record year for the company. In fiscal year 2016, we opened over 2,000 net new stores, which are outperforming the prior classes of new stores. We grew global same-store sales by 5%. And we gained share of at-home coffee and ready-to-drink down the aisle. We also advanced several long-term growth priorities that include new Roasteries, a new Reserve store concept, enhanced CPG growth platforms, and we continue to execute against our long-term commitment in China.", "I believe these results demonstrate the value we are realizing from the investments we are making in our partners, innovation, and the digital flywheel. Our approach of investing for long-term value creation, while driving excellence in execution today, is enabling us to deliver results in a challenging operating environment while positioning our business for long-term growth.", "Serving as a member of this leadership team is a privilege, and I want to take this opportunity to thank each of my partners for their passion, teamwork and focus. On today's call, I will share an overview of our Q4 segment performance, provide insight into the work we are doing to expand our customer reach and frequency, and update you on our upcoming holiday campaign. Let's start with our Americas segment.", "Our Americas business, with more than 9,000 company-operated and 6,500 licensed stores in 17 countries, delivered 5% comp growth in the quarter, driving record Q4 revenues, up 17% year-on-year. Please note that all references I make to revenue on this call will be on the 53-week basis. AUVs for both our existing and newest class of U.S. stores reached record levels, giving us confidence in our decision to open approximately 800 net new stores throughout the Americas in fiscal 2017. This was where our focus on innovative new store designs, from express stores to Roasteries, elevating the customer experience, and innovative premium offerings, are paying off.", "Drilling down, our U.S. business delivered record Q4 revenues, up 18% over last year. U.S. comps accelerated from Q3 and posted a 4% increase. Our U.S. comps included a 6% increase in ticket and a 1% decline in transactions resulting from a shift in customer behavior away from order splitting and towards order consolidation. This follows a foundational change we made to our Rewards program, taking it from a frequency-based to a spend-based model.", "While neutral to revenue, we estimate the impact of order consolidation drove transactions down by approximately two points and ticket up by approximately two points. It's important to note that this conversion from transaction to ticket reflects customers choosing to put multiple items on one ticket rather than an actual decline in traffic in our stores. And this will persist in our comp results until we lap the transition to the new Rewards program.", "Overall, our U.S. business grew in every day-part, with particularly strong growth in our morning day-part. Our core beverage platforms contributed approximately two points of comp in Q4. Beverage innovation drove another point of comp, with Coconut Milk Macchiato, Latte Macchiato, Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew and Teavana Iced Berry Sangria. These are great examples of customers trading up to premium beverage offerings that differentiate the Starbucks Experience and create further separation from competitors.", "Food contributed one point of comp in the quarter, led by continued strength of our breakfast sandwich lineup, up 17% over last year and 60% over the last two years. Lunch remains a significant opportunity as we amplify the strength of our Bistro Box platform through the Power Lunch offering. While we've made great progress around food in the lunch day-part, we believe there is a significant opportunity ahead.", "Our digital flywheel momentum accelerated through Q4 and we have now enabled this digital flywheel to spin even faster with the launch of true one-to-one personalization. While still in the early days, personalized reward offerings have more than doubled customer response rates over previous segmented email campaigns. This translates to increased customer engagement and spend.", "A few relevant metrics on Starbucks Rewards. Membership is up 18% year-on-year. Mobile payment now represents 25% of all transactions, up from 20% a year ago. Customers continue to embrace Mobile Order & Pay, which now represents 6% of transactions, reaching 7% in the month of September. To put this into perspective, approximately 3,300 of our stores are handling 10% of their orders at peak through Mobile Order & Pay. In 600 stores, Mobile Order & Pay represents over 20% of orders at peak, triple the number from last year. The data shows that Mobile Order & Pay is making a difference for both our partners and our customers. For customers, Mobile Order & Pay provides a simple, elegant ordering experience, enabling convenience when they want it and rewards them with stars along the way. For partners, Mobile Order & Pay reduces line congestion, enables a more efficient in-store operation.", "We are continuously improving the Mobile Order & Pay experience with newly released functionality that presents our personalized offer directly on the front screen of the mobile app and allows the customer to save favorite stores, favorite customized beverages. And we have new features in the pipeline to be released shortly, including real-time, personalized product suggestions, and the ability to save favorite orders, and there's more coming. We are enabling these digital experiences to bring joy to our customers while driving business outcomes. These digital flywheel investments are core to elevating our brand experience and building for our future.", "Let's move on to China-Asia Pacific. Starbucks China-Asia Pacific delivered another record performance this quarter, with year-on-year revenue growth of 29%. Starbucks China remained strong despite moderating GDP growth in China, and we remain committed to build at least 500 net new stores each year for the next five years.", "Comp sales in CAP increased 1% in the quarter, with China's 6% comp almost evenly split between increases in traffic and ticket, demonstrating that we are both reaching new customers and increasing frequency in China. As we have previously indicated, CAP comps are more heavily weighted towards Japan, where comps were slightly negative but profitability remains strong. Japan comps in the quarter were impacted by ongoing consumer and economic challenges, as well as a tough compare over last year. As we navigate the near-term challenges in Japan, we remain very optimistic about the long-term potential in the country.", "We opened 316 net new stores in CAP in Q4 and now operate over 6,400 stores in 15 markets across the region, including over 2,400 stores in 114 cities in China. As Howard mentioned, Starbucks stores in China are among the most elegant, efficient, coffee-forward and profitable stores in our global store portfolio. With loyalty as a cornerstone, we are extremely pleased with the growth and evolution of our digital ecosystem in CAP. Currently, 13 CAP markets of our 15 CAP markets offer a loyalty program and stored value card. 11 of those markets accept digital payment. We now have 20 million Starbucks Rewards members in the CAP region, with over $1 billion loaded on the stored value cards in FY 2016.", "The momentum of our digital platform in the region is particularly evident in China where we now have 12 million members, just under half of whom are active Rewards members. Our China-Asia Pacific business continues to perform well, further reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.", "Let's move on to EMEA. The Starbucks brand remains strong in EMEA. Although reported comps declined by 1%, overall system comp grew at 4% for the quarter. EMEA's Q4 reported revenues declined year-on-year by 12%. However, after adjusting for the approximately 26% impact of the transfer of company-owned to licensed stores and for foreign exchange, EMEA adjusted revenues increased 13% year-on-year, this despite continuing economic, geopolitical and consumer headwinds throughout the region. We now operate in 43 markets throughout EMEA, and in FY 2016, we added 280 net new stores. In Q4, we opened 77 net new stores, all of which were licensed.", "The mix shift toward a licensed model is enabling us to grow our store footprint more rapidly while expanding underlying operating margin over time. We introduced Teavana handcrafted beverages in Starbucks stores across 29 EMEA markets. Teavana has been very well received by customers, exceeding our most optimistic expectations. We're off to a good start in EMEA.", "Let's move on to Channel Development. Channel Development had a very strong Q4, with revenue growing 14% year-on-year, driven by share gains in at-home coffee. The strength of the Starbucks brand and great execution by our channels team drove this result. Our K-Cup business posted strong sales growth and gained over half point of share. Starbucks continues to be the number one K-Cup brand for the fifth consecutive quarter.", "Fall Blend, a seasonal favorite and the launch of Caff\u00e8 Latte K-Cups including Pumpkin Spice, contributed to the strong results. Starbucks roast and ground coffee continues to be the number one premium packaged coffee brand, growing faster than the entire category, and gaining over one full point of market share in the quarter. In addition to being the number one premium coffee brand, Starbucks solidified its position as the number two brand in the total coffee category, with share increasing to 15.8%. Through our North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo, our Ready-to-Drink business performed well with double shot Frappuccino and chilled multi-serve, which enabled another point of share gain in the liquid coffee and energy segment.", "We have added additional CPG growth engines to the pipeline. The first is our plan to bring premium Teavana Ready-to-Drink teas to the U.S. through our partnership with Anheuser-Busch. We will begin to launch regionally during the first half of calendar 2017. In addition, we are expanding internationally with the recent launch of locally manufactured ready-to-drink Frappuccino through a partnership in China. Tingyi has rapidly achieved distribution in over 35 major Chinese cities and although it is still early days, we are experiencing strong consumer demand.", "In Europe, we recently launched Starbucks Nespresso compatible capsules in the UK and France and the early results are encouraging. Channel Development continues to perform extremely well with additional growth opportunities just getting started.", "On to holiday. We are very excited about our holiday plans. We have a solid marketing plan in place where our stores transform to holiday red and the holiday cups return. We will introduce wonderful food and beverage offerings, an amplified Starbucks for Life campaign and a platform of beautiful Starbucks gift cards and merchandise. We will also introduce our first specialty Cold Brew Coffee for the holidays, spice sweet cream Nari\u00f1o 70 Cold Brew, our Starbucks Rewards members can get a first taste of this new handcrafted beverage starting today.", "A few final words before turning the call over to Scott. As a leadership team navigating the current environment, we are mindful of our responsibilities to deliver near-term results, build a foundation for our future growth and stay true to the mission and values that brought us to this point in our journey. I believe our fiscal year 2016 results reflect this mindset. I want to thank the more than 300,000 Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the green apron. No other company has the opportunity to touch so many lives and each day, our store partners show up committed to our mission and deliver a customer experience like no other. Each and every Starbucks partner helps bring our brand to life. For their commitment and hard work, they have my utmost respect and gratitude.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Scott?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks Q4 of fiscal 2016 was the most profitable quarter capping off the most profitable year in the company's history. Q4 EPS was $0.54 and on a 14-week non-GAAP basis it was $0.56 with the extra week contributing approximately $0.06. Excluding the extra week, our non-GAAP EPS in Q4 grew by 16% over last year, representing our 15th straight quarter of non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% or greater.", "Please note that for comparability purposes, all remaining non-GAAP references on today's call will exclude the extra week. Our consolidated operating margin in Q4 came in at 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 20.9% on a non-GAAP basis, improving 90 basis points over last year's fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin. Operating margin improvement was driven primarily by sales leverage and favorability in commodity costs that more than offset the impact of increased partner investments and certain additional G&A costs. For the quarter, consolidated operating income increased 27% on a GAAP basis and 13% on a non-GAAP basis.", "I'll now take you through our Q4 operating performance by segment. Let's start with the Americas. The Americas segment delivered both record operating income of $1.1 billion, and operating margin of 27.6% driven by strong performance in our businesses across the region. Non-GAAP operating income increased 18% over last year to $988 million, while operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 26.9%. This improvement was primarily driven by sales leverage that was partially offset by partner investments.", "I'd like to call out two specific additional items in the Americas results this quarter. First, you will note that we saw leverage on store operating expenses during the quarter compared to deleverage for the full year. This result was driven by several factors, including a somewhat lower run rate of partner investments in Q4, a comparison to higher relative partner investments last Q4, some salary and benefit true-ups during Q4 this year and improved productivity in the stores. This productivity improvement includes the impact of removing nearly 10% of transactions from the POS over the past year or so, 6% coming from Mobile Order & Pay and two points coming from order consolidation. Going forward, we anticipate that store operating expenses will again show deleverage, given the level of partner investments we have planned for 2017. Second, Americas operating margin in Q4 was favorably impacted by 60 basis points as a result of a favorable legal settlement recorded in other operating expenses.", "Let's move on to China-Asia Pacific. Starbucks China-Asia Pacific segment also delivered record quarterly GAAP and non-GAAP operating income in Q4. Operating income increased 48% to $192 million, and operating margin expanded by 300 basis points. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income increased by 34% to $189 million, and operating margin expanded 250 basis points. This performance made CAP once again the segment with the strongest quarterly top- and bottom-line growth. Margin expansion in CAP was primarily driven by the transition to a value-added tax structure in China, increased sales leverage and higher income from our joint venture operations. This favorability was partially offset by a negative 150 basis point impact of foreign currency translation. Stiff currency headwinds made CAP's margin expansion in Q4 even that much more noteworthy.", "Let's turn to EMEA. Despite a very difficult business environment, EMEA delivered the second most profitable quarter in its history. Operating income decreased slightly in Q4, driven by lower revenues from company-owned stores. GAAP operating margin in Q4 came in at 17% while non-GAAP operating margin came in at 16.2%, down 100 basis points from the prior year's record quarter. Foreign exchange impacted EMEA margins significantly in Q4 with margin actually expanding after adjusting for FX. This expansion resulted from the ongoing shift in our store ownership model to an increasingly licensed store point \u2013 portfolio, once again reinforcing the correctness of our EMEA store strategy.", "As Kevin mentioned, Starbucks Channel Development segment continued to take category share in Q4 while also delivering record quarterly operating income and strong operating margin expansion. Operating income for the segment was $244 million, and operating margin was 47.1%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income reached $230 million, up 16% year-over-year as operating margin increased 480 basis points over the prior-year quarter to 48%. This improvement was driven primarily by favorability in COGS, primarily coffee costs, and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi.", "Noteworthy is that Channel Development Q4 revenue growth excluding the extra week was 5%, somewhat lower than recent quarters driven by a very strong comparison in Q4 of last year. We are off to a strong start in Q1 of 2017 and anticipate revenue growth for Channel Development in the high-single digits for the current quarter.", "Our consolidated and segment performance for the full fiscal year 2016 were equally as strong. For the year, Starbucks posted record consolidated operating income of just over $4 billion with an 80 basis point expansion in operating margin to 19.6%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the $0.06 for the 53rd week, EPS grew by 17% or nearly 19% after adjusting for approximately two points of impact from foreign exchange.", "Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.6% reflected a 50 basis point improvement over last year's non-GAAP operating margin. The increase was primarily driven by sales leverage that more than offset approximately 70 basis points of increased costs related to partner and digital investments.", "Consolidated revenue growth on a 52-week basis was 9% but reached 10% after adjusting for one point of negative FX impact. Drilling down into segment performance for the year, our Americas segment delivered 110 basis points of GAAP operating margin expansion and 80 basis points of non-GAAP margin expansion, driven primarily by strong sales leverage, partially offset by increased partner investments. For the full year, our CAP segment delivered 60 basis points of margin expansion to 21.5%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin expanded by 50 basis points to 23.1%. Noteworthy is the CAP margin expanded despite approximately 200 basis points of negative impact from the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and the last bit of impact from the Japan ownership change.", "Excluding these two items, segment margin expansion was significantly ahead of expectation for the year, driven by strong store level profitability in both China and Japan. For the year, EMEA margin was 13.5% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and a decrease of 30 basis points from fiscal 2015, due primarily to the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of FX, EMEA margin expanded slightly as the continued shift to a licensed model drove margin expansion despite very challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environments in the region.", "Finally, for the full year, Channel Development operating margin reached 41.8%. Non-GAAP operating income grew 21% and margin expanded by 410 basis points, representing Channel Development's fourth straight year of margin expansion in excess of 100 basis points. We started the year planning to open 1,800 net new stores globally and ended the year with over 2,000 net new stores, showing the confidence we had both in our store development teams and in the profitability our new stores generate. In a time where most other retailers are cutting openings and increasing closures, we are prudently but confidently increasing our openings somewhat for next year.", "Finally, our effective tax rate for 2016 was 32.9% compared to 29.3% in fiscal 2015, reflecting the impact of almost an entirely non-taxable gain in fiscal 2015 related to the Starbucks Japan acquisition. The strength and health of our business enables us to continue generating significant operating cash flow to both fund profitable growth opportunities and return significant amounts of cash back to shareholders. We returned a record of approximately $3.2 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, a 33% year-over-year increase. And today, we announced that our board has approved the 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share.", "Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong performance and profitability. Here are the relevant targets for fiscal 2017. Consistent with our long-term guidance range, we expect global comp growth in FY 2017 to be in the mid-single digits range, with the first half of the year towards the lower end of that range and some improvement during the second half of the year within that range. Complementing our expected comp growth will be the addition of approximately 2,100 net new stores globally, up slightly from 2016, with 60% of planned openings outside the U.S. The Americas segment is expected to add 800 net new stores, split roughly evenly between company-owned and licensed.", "Our China/Asia Pacific segment will drive almost half of our global new store growth at approximately 1,000 net new stores, two-thirds of which will be licensed. And our EMEA segment is targeting approximately 300 net new stores in fiscal 2017, virtually all of which will be licensed. These factors contribute to expected revenue growth of approximately 10% compared to fiscal 2016 on a 52-week basis.", "Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin is expected to improve slightly from 2016 on a 52-week basis, reflecting strong revenue growth and leverage on cost of goods sold and G&A partially offset by the impact of increased investments for retail store partners and digital investments. We expect partner and digital investments to increase by approximately $250 million versus an increase of approximately $160 million in 2016. The bulk of these investments will be in the U.S. and driven by increased partner wages and benefits. We also expect to make investments in our major markets around the world including paving the way for global expansion of our digital flywheel and increases in certain partner benefits such as housing allowances in key markets.", "Let me pause to put our increased partner investments in relation to our earnings growth in 2017 into proper perspective. Last year, we increased investments by about $160 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS growth of 19% when adjusting for 2 points of negative FX impact. This year, we are targeting about $250 million of incremental investments and we are still planning to deliver non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to 16%. Given the strength in our businesses across the globe and ongoing efficiency opportunities in our supply chain and G&A cost structure, we are confident that we can deliver on our targets while appropriately funding our investments.", "Looking at our segments, we expect our operating margin in the Americas to be flat to up slightly relative to 2016, reflecting sales leverage and increased operational efficiencies but offset by the impact of increased investments. We expect moderate operating margin expansion in CAP with FX negatively impacting this segment a bit again in 2017. Operating margin in EMEA will approach 15% for the year as we continue to optimize the portfolio and realize the benefits of the ongoing business model shift from company-owned to licensed stores. And our Channel Development segment will again drive moderate margin expansion versus prior year, though less than the very strong 410 basis point expansion we saw in 2016. All of this segment margin guidance I just shared is on a 52-week non-GAAP basis.", "Given all of these inputs, we expect fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS in the range of $2.09 to $2.11 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.12 to $2.14. Specifically looking at Q1 2017, we are targeting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.51 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.51 to $0.52, representing a somewhat lower year-over-year growth rate than the full year. This dynamic is driven by the significant Q1 ramping of the partner investments we announced this summer.", "Neither FX or commodities are expected to have a major impact on year-over-year profit growth, with FX slightly unfavorable and commodities slightly favorable. We have our coffee needs about two-thirds price locked for FY 2017. We expect our effective tax rate for 2017 will be about 34% and capital expenditures will be about $1.6 billion.", "As I said at the outset, Starbucks fiscal Q4 capped off a record year for the company, performance that was particularly noteworthy, as it was delivered in the face of strong FX headwinds and challenging economic, consumer, and geopolitical environments in many markets around the world in which we compete. And as you can see, each of our segments contributed to our performance in the quarter and year in a meaningful way. We are producing industry-leading returns on our capital and investments while increasing our cash return to shareholders. Once again, credit for our success goes to our store partners around the world, whose dedication and commitment to delivering an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers enables us to consistently deliver the results we do. We're looking forward to sharing more of our future plans with you at our upcoming Investor Day.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies. Andy, your line is now open.", "Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC", "Yeah, just wondering on the U.S. comp and the round-down. Did you see sort of some of the afternoon pressures and Frappuccino declines as the summer went on with your summer beverage program? Or did things get a little bit better there and you kind of have some products that can maybe pick up the slack for Frappuccino?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, Andy, this is Kevin. First of all, we saw growth in every day-part in the U.S. this last quarter. And Frappuccino contributed a bit of comp. So, from the weakness we had in Frappuccino in Q3, we saw positive contribution towards comp from Frappuccino in Q4.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC. David, your line is now open.", "Eric Gonzalez - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi. Good evening. This is Eric Gonzalez in for Dave Palmer. I think you said your mobile payment mix is about 25% during the quarter. I think this implies that, similar to last quarter, I think they have flattened out on a sequential basis. Have you analyzed why this might be? And do you think that there's steps you could take to jumpstart the growth in that mix?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, this is Kevin. First of all, the order consolidation impact has an impact on this as well. Keep in mind, this is 25% of transaction paid for with the mobile app. And so, with the order consolidation, you have customers actually doing more spend on the mobile app, but the number stays the same. And I think late in the quarter, we've seen that tick up 26%. So you have \u2013 the big contributor, though, was the order consolidation that impacted that.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Sara, your line is now open.", "Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you. I wanted to ask about the Roastery and the Reserve stores. And I guess the halo you mentioned. Can you talk perhaps about anything you're seeing in terms of customer perception that you might track? And I guess for those of us in New York, we see a lot of these so-called third wave coffee shops opening up. So is this sort of a beachhead for Starbucks against that? Are you not seeing an impact from that? Just wanted to get a sense of what the Roasteries and the Reserve stores are doing for you. Thank you.", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you. Sara, can I just ask you, have you seen the Roastery in Seattle? Have you been there?", "Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "I have.", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "Okay. Would you agree with me that you've never seen anything quite like that?", "Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "It is magical. That is an accurate assessment.", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "Okay, all right. I guess if you're a lawyer, you're never supposed to ask a question you don't know the answer to, so I took a little risk there. But I think anyone who has seen the Roastery understands that in addition to it being the kind of coffee experience, it has really no peer in terms of any retail experience. But all along, we set out to build a new brand and that was Starbucks Reserve, with the understanding that we had an opportunity to elevate the core business and really take the brand and the coffee up to a new level. Now, many of us have seen this take place in other industries, the fashion industry, the automobile industry, I think a good analog is what Nike's been able to do with Air Jordan and that is build a profit center and a sub brand that unto itself is a growth engine and, as a result of that, shines a halo on the entire company.", "Now the Roastery itself has created the kind of retail experience that we are learning a great deal from. And the primary thing we're learning is that the Reserve bar, which in our parlance, that's the espresso bar and where all the coffee is made in multiple brewing methods, that has created excitement, interest, education, romance, theater, but it also has created the opportunity for us to provide our customers with a different coffee experience and, candidly, at a higher ticket. And so, we're taking learning from that and we're integrating that into existing and new Starbucks stores.", "Those are the four stores that opened in Manhattan. They've opened in Lake Forest, Illinois. They've opened in Japan and China. And what we're seeing is the core Starbucks customer is coming into the store, and as a result of seeing Reserve and getting educated, they're taking their cue from the Reserve bar and the presentation and they're moving over to the Reserve bar and now purchasing espresso-based beverages that are more exotic, different taste profile, higher ticket, and obviously that shines a halo on the Starbucks Experience. Now, the big opportunity, in addition to that, is we believe that given the fact that the Roastery is only going be in 10 markets, 20 markets, 30 markets over the next number of years, the question is how do we scale the Reserve brand and how do we make it more accessible to our customers?", "So we have been diligently working on a new store format and that new store format is Starbucks Reserve stores. And basically, if you can think about it this way, it's a 3,000 square foot store that has the design, the elegance, the materiality and all the romance without roasting in the store with artisanal food that we're bringing from Italy that we talked about in the last call, that's Princi. And those stores will begin opening in the second half of the year. So the Reserve brand, the pyramid starts with the Roastery. It goes to the Reserve store and then goes to the Reserve bar. As I said in my prepared remarks, we think that we're sitting on an opportunity to not only elevate the equity of the brand but drive incrementality in existing Starbucks stores and create a new growth platform for the company domestically and internationally. And, most importantly, take the company up.", "But the short answer to your first question is this is not in response to any so-called third wave coffee, this is in response to the fact that we have a customer base of almost 90 million strong. And we know that our customers have given us license and have the trust in us to elevate the experience, and the Roastery is a proof source that we're onto something that we can scale and create a national and a global footprint as a result of it.", "And the last piece of this is we're now selling Starbucks Reserve whole bean and ground coffee in existing Starbucks stores, and this is just the beginning of leveraging multiple channels of distribution under that brand.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. John, your line is now open.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much. It seems that membership in My Starbucks Rewards is sort of the beginning of the funnel, you get consumers in at these mobile payment, mobile ordering, and yet I'm always surprised at how few people are actually members when I talk to friends, families, whatever, the members of the program. So how do you accelerate that? And I thought one of the reasons that you were changing the point system was enable to use the points outside \u2013 or the Stars outside of the Starbucks stores. We haven't heard much in terms of new alliances, for example, to broaden that to people who may not have been Starbucks customers become members through other organizations or affiliations you may have. Where do you stand on that process?", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, John. Matt Ryan here. First of all, we see this as an enormous opportunity moving forward. We know that very few of our customers, relatively speaking, have become members. And that, to us, represents an enormous opportunity moving forward. What we do know is that when we are able to convert somebody into being a member of the program, we see tremendous incrementally as they join the program. And we continue to see that accelerate. Over the past few months, we have worked on successfully transitioning our program to a spend-based program, and we are now seeing the uptick in spend per member and engagement that we anticipated from the launch of the program. So we're completely on track and accelerating in that regard.", "Our next big opportunity moving forward, especially in the natural window that we have ahead of us in the next two quarters is to take advantage of the traffic we see, the card volume we do to convert even more people into Starbucks Rewards.", "And just on the topic of extending outside of Starbucks, it's never been our intention to have Starbucks Stars be used at other venues. But we are going to be giving customers the opportunity to earn Stars at other venues, starting with a partnership with Chase, which we previously announced.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. David, your line is now open.", "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good afternoon. Scott, I wanted to ask about the guidance. I know you mentioned that you expect mid-single-digit comps for the year and perhaps a lower part of that in the first half of the year and the upper part of that in the second half of the year, if I heard you correctly. So could you just talk about what you might be trying to signal there about the first half of the year? Whether it's kind of more of the same versus what we've been seeing in the recent quarters? And then maybe talk about why that would be the case? Is it just comparisons? Or are you thinking there's certain initiatives that start to kick in in the second half of the year that will help the comps?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, thanks, David. I think I would start with the fact that Howard covered around the environment that we're facing right now in many of our major markets around the globe. So the consumer remains under pressure in many places in Europe and Asia as well as here in the U.S., economic uncertainty around the overall consumer environment, around the election, that continues to weigh on our customers around the globe. And I think we can see that continuing as we get into 2017.", "And then I would point to the fact that the comparisons that we had over the last couple quarters have been particularly difficult and impacted our comps that we reported in Q3 and Q4. And those comparisons, if anything, they get a little bit tougher as you get into Q1 and certainly stay as tough in Q2. So that weighs into the guidance.", "And then the third thing, perhaps the most important thing is, we do have a number of initiatives that we'll be rolling out and accelerating over the course of the year. And we're going to spend a lot of time talk about this during Investor Day, but they include innovation around store development and store design, even beyond what Howard's talking about in Reserve focused stores.", "But as we go through a pretty significant cycle of remodels, we see ways to do those remodels to both improve the customer experience as well as our partner experience and productivity. When you get on the digital front, Kevin talked about some of this, but we just launched Favorites from an item standpoint and from a store standpoint. I'm sure John you've used the Favorite stores. It's so much easier if you're in a dense, urban area that to pick among your stores and save them and quickly get what you want.", "Same thing with Favorite items for highly customized beverages. So that's just rolling out. And over the next couple of quarters, we'll get to suggested selling, where as the customers building their order in the app, we'll be able to make relevant product suggestions to them. So that's all coming. Then product and food or food and beverage innovation is coming. Kevin talked about holiday. As we get into the new calendar year, there's a number of things that we'll talk about on the food side that we'll sample at Investor Day. So I think as we look into calendar year 2017, there's a number of things that make us a bit more optimistic that we might be able to get in the middle of that mid-single-digit range versus I think the first six months or so it will be towards the lower-end of that range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen & Co. Andrew, your line is now open.", "Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Can you walk us through how that 1% headwind from transaction splitting in 3Q widened to the 2% in 4Q? It's basically implying that there's going to be with one person used to do three transactions or two people used to do three transactions consolidating that into one. I understand the benefits obviously of the program and why that would normally happen but I guess I'm curious about why that widened?", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Sure. It's Matt Ryan here. Let me take a stab at trying to answer that. It's a little bit complex so bear with me here. What we are seeing is basically how we record the transactions of customers in our stores and what we had in the past, but we didn't necessarily have visibility to, are people or parties of people coming in and buying multiple items. We could predict and forecast based upon what we saw on a singular account, somebody coming in and buying something and then right away using the same account again to buy something else. And that accounted for about 1 point of, what we call, transaction splitting going away. But what we were able to see through the end of the second quarter, especially as people adjusted their habits, was that there was actually consolidation taking place between multiple accounts.", "And, of course, there would have been no way for us to see that before. But what we saw were multiple beverages being put on Starbucks Rewards accounts where they hadn't been put on there before. When you roll that all up together, what that means is we had two total points of what had been recorded on separate accounts before, now being consolidated onto a single account. So while the actual traffic wasn't any different, we're seeing consolidation of two points when you take both of those things into consideration.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "I'd just add one thing to what Matt said. We started to see that in beverage attach, so as we got into the summer we had the point that we expected but when we looked at beverage attach that really started to increase significantly and that's when we knew that multiple accounts were putting beverages on a single transaction where they were splitting it before.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John, your line is now open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Thank you. Howard, I was going to ask you to maybe apply the current environment in terms of what we're seeing both in the U.S. and around the world in the consumer environment, to what you've seen elsewhere in your decades of experience at Starbucks. And I guess a lot of us who are on the call are wondering if the environment can actually get better from where we are today. And as you kind of think about the election and getting that behind us, whether there's kind of an opportunity for the overall consumer sentiment in spending and the external environment perhaps being more of a tailwind than a headwind that's been in the last couple of years.", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "John, I wish I was as smart as you might expect me to be. I mean I think we're asking ourselves the same questions that you have just posed. And also I think as we get around our table and we talk about the business, if you were in the room you'd hear us talking about the fact that we don't want to use weather and we don't want to use the uncertainty in the election as an excuse. But nevertheless, we are all trying to navigate through a difficult time. I mean I would label this time as just a high degree of uncertainty that obviously is domestically driven but has affected the rest of the world. John and I and Cliff just last week we're in China and Japan, and Cliff and I will be in Europe next week, and I think it's safe to say that wherever we have been, I don't think we've ever witnessed such concern about what could happen in the U.S. as a result of the election.", "And I think there's no question, as I speak to other retailers and other merchants both in and out of our sector, that there isn't one exception where everyone is experiencing, I think, a very unpredictable and erratic chain of events where it's very, very hard. I think what's equally hard, it's very hard to cut through all of the noise and try and get access to the customer and try and get your message out.", "So I think we've tried to be very disciplined and very thoughtful about how we spend our money, both in traditional advertising and social media, so that we are not in any way kind of getting caught into all of this. I think everyone is hoping that post the election, there will be a return to a natural state of affairs in terms of the consumer behavior. But I think there's another issue on the table that we have not yet discussed that I talked about three years ago, and that is the seismic shift in consumer traffic.", "I was talking to Fred Smith just a couple of weeks ago about his situation at FedEx and he shared with me a piece of research which showed a significant drop in foot traffic on Main Street and in malls, not only domestically and around the world, as a result of e-commerce, the Web, and what I'll loosely describe as the Amazon effect. As a result of that, you're certainly seeing large companies and small companies not only not open new stores, but announce closures.", "And let me just speak to that. I know this is a little long-winded but I think it's important. There's no doubt that over the next five years or so, we are going to see a dramatic level of retailers not be able to sustain their level of core business as a traditional bricks-and-mortar retailer, and their omni-channel approach is not going to be sustainable to maintain their cost of their infrastructure. And as a result of that, there's going to be tremendous amount of changes with regard to the retail landscape.", "We believe, as we look down that pipe and look at the future, that our ability to maintain our growth in terms of new stores domestically and internationally, coupled with the fact that Starbucks still maintains a very special place in terms of a sense of community, the third place environment, and people looking for and seeking out human contact and a place to go, that as these store closures occur, and they will, that we are going to be in a very unique position five years, 10 years down the road because there's going to be a lot less people competing for those customers. I'm not talking about the coffee category; I'm talking overall.", "But we are in the very, very early stages of a tremendous change in the bricks-and-mortar footprint of retailers domestically and internationally as a result of the sea change in how people are buying things, and that's going to have, I think, a negative effect on all of retail. But we believe that it's going to have ultimately a positive effect on the position that we occupy and the environment that we create in our stores.", "So short answer, I think we got to get through this uncertainty. We're playing the long game in everything we do and we're going to continue to do everything we can to win the hearts and minds of our customers and invest in our people, and really, I think, create a breakthrough innovation as a result of what we're doing with the Roastery and other things. And just one thing about the Roastery. As New York and Shanghai opened, for those of you who have seen Seattle, I'll tell you that Shanghai and New York will be 2.0 as good as Seattle is. Wait until you see what we're going to do in New York and Shanghai. I mean, it's going to change the company, the brand, and everything we do.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is now open.", "Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah, just two quick clarifications and a question. Just one, Scott, on the guidance on the investments. Just to be clear, that $250 million is incremental to the $160 million? It's not $90 million over the $160 million? And then on the coffee outlook, can you just say if that's kind of looking flat or up or down for next year on what you have locked? And then the bigger picture question is just on the disruption I guess you saw last quarter when you switched the loyalty program, and people getting used to that new structure. Do you think there's still some disruption there that needs to get worked through or has that been sort of fully understood and people moving forward now with that?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Thanks, Jason. I'll take the first couple and then I'll pass it over to Matt. The $250 million is incremental, so it would be on top of the $160 million. And then we see coffee a little bit favorable year-over-year. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's pretty much offset by slightly negative foreign exchange impact.", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Great. And as for the disruption, a couple of key things. I think we're through with anything you might characterize as disruption, but I want to be careful with what I mean there. Number one is that we saw no attrition from the so-called disadvantaged people. We studied this issue very carefully and tracked it all through the summer, and we did not see those people who are not earning Rewards as quickly diminish in any way within the program. The thing that we did want to see last quarter but which we saw this quarter was an acceleration in spend per member.", "So keep in mind that the reason why we did this was to able to have the lever not just of transaction but also of ticket. That didn't materialize in Q3 but did materialize in Q4. And we are seeing acceleration in the spending per member. So we're feeling very, very good about having come out of the program transition with very minimal collateral damage in any way and a good trajectory in front of us, especially as we lean into acquiring new members.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley from Bank of America. Joe, your line is now open.", "Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. One follow up as well and then one additional question. Could you share with us \u2013 this is the follow-up \u2013 could you share with us the My Starbucks Rewards, what percent of either sales or transactions the total program represents? I mean whether people are doing it on their phone or doing it kind of in a more old-fashioned way or however they're doing it, what that total is? And then secondly, wanted to ask about the espresso bars and where you stand in that rollout and if you could talk a bit about the type of sales impact you see when you install that in an existing Starbucks.", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Sure. Matt Ryan here. Very quickly on the percent of tender. So we see 33% of tender coming in from Starbucks Rewards across mobile and registered Cards. We see an additional 5% coming in from non-registered Cards. So between Card and the Starbucks Rewards program is at 38%. And mobile of course is at 25% right now.", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "Joe, with regard to the espresso \u2013 sorry \u2013 with regard to the espresso bars...", "Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "No, no. Thank you.", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "What's very interesting about the evolution of the espresso bars is that we actually started this, believe it or not, in China. That the China experience and the design of the stores gave rise to the understanding that we had an opportunity in existing Starbucks stores and some new stores to offer the customer an alternative based on what was going on and what we were initially learning in the Roastery. So it's very early on domestically and we've been doing this in Asia for a while.", "But if we look at what's happened in the Roastery and we say to ourselves, could we transfer the opportunity of premiumization in an existing or new Starbucks store? What we're learning is in the stores that have opened in New York \u2013 and I'll mention them again \u2013 85th and Madison, 10 Waverly, Brookfield Place, and 9th and Broadway, a new store in Lake Forest, Illinois \u2013 what we're seeing, and it's early days, is that customers are moving their core beverages to the espresso bar. They're enjoying the opportunity to sit at the bar because of the theater and the romance of watching their beverage be made. And the ticket is going up. But it's early.", "So this is an opportunity that we have to integrate those Reserve bars in many of the stores that are going to be naturally on a remodel cycle as well as open new stores from scratch. And then as I said earlier, the Reserve stores coupled with their Roastery is going to create an opportunity for the brand to be elevated with a lot of awareness and a lot of trial. So this is part of a comprehensive all-in strategy that, we believe, will create an incremental opportunity for profit and revenue as a result of this new brand and, as a result of that, shine a halo on the core brand of Starbucks. John, you want to add something?", "John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, I just want to add one thing, Joe. This is John Culver. What we saw in China and what we're seeing in the U.S. is really the enablement of the partner and customer connection, really come to life in a very special and unique way. And it really played out for us very clearly in China by the fact that a lot of the Chinese consumers didn't have a lot of education around coffee, and didn't have a lot of education around brewing methods, espresso-based beverages. And it's interesting to see in China how the customers gather around the bar, basically pull out their cell phones, take pictures, take videos and really we are educating customers one at a time in China around great tasting coffee and a great experience that Starbucks is able to provide.", "You walk into New York City, we were there a couple weeks ago with Howard, and we saw firsthand a similar type of experience from the standpoint of the number of people sitting at the bar, wanting to interact with the baristas and really wanting to understand the various brewing methods. And it's really something that really elevates the experience, and the customer response has been incredible, number one. And even the partner engagement around this has been remarkable as well. So we're very positive and optimistic about what the future has for this for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is now open.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. China/Asia Pacific comps came in a little bit lighter than I think what most folks were modeling. And in the past there's been I think a degree of seasonality to the China business related to changes in gifting practices. So just curious if you could help us understand sequentially how much of that trend was driven by China and within that maybe some seasonality to the comp? And what sort of gives you confidence that can reaccelerate? Thanks.", "John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.", "Okay. Karen, this is John. Just real quick on China. Again, very optimistic about where we sit in the marketplace. We delivered a 6% comp in the market, far above any of our peer set in that environment over there. What we are seeing across China is just very strong acceptance for the Starbucks brand. You look at the number of customers that we're attracting into our stores. Our brand has never been stronger. And the customer engagement has never been stronger as well. So we're increasing frequency of existing customers, and we continue to attract new customers.", "What you saw in Q4 was very similar to what we saw last Q4. Last Q4, last year we delivered a 6%. This quarter we delivered a 6% as well. There is some seasonality going from Q3 to Q4. We've seen that historically play out in China. I don't think you need to read anything into it other than the fact that our business there remains strong. We had record openings in terms of stores in the quarter in China, opening over 200 stores in the market. Our new store performance is the strongest it's ever been. Our average unit volumes, our return on investment, and our overall store level profitability remains best-in-class within the company. So very optimistic again about China and the opportunity that we have there to continue to grow. And the investments we're making on our people and the infrastructure are critical to the success going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Jeffrey, your line is now open.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much. I just had a question broadly on the U.S. comps. I know last quarter there was talk about the re-acceleration in trend to a 5% plus. I'm wondering if you were to look at that, maybe qualitatively, how much do you think was the elevated macro headwinds versus maybe any kind of internal headwinds that made it more challenging to hit that. And with that as a backdrop, and we've talked a lot about the broader macro challenges we're facing and starting the year kind of at the lower end of that range, so just wondering whether the mid-single-digit or better is still the best assumption to make once you get to a system your size? Or whether or not maybe we should just be tempering the expectation a little bit so it becomes less about the quarter-to-quarter of achieving a certain 5% or whatnot? I'm just wondering how you think about that holistically there. Or maybe just define what that mid-single-digit range actually means in terms of numbers?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "That's the easiest part. Mid-single-digits is 4% to 6%. I think what I would say, Jeffrey, as we started the quarter, we guided really on Americas to get to a 5% comp, and we got there. Obviously, as you know, and it's the nature of your question, the U.S. business is the biggest piece of that. What I would say is, with the Americas at 5% and the U.S. at 6% and minus 1%, it gives you an indication of exactly how close we were to 5% in the U.S. I don't want to split hairs. I'd much rather have a 5%. But clearly comps accelerated both in the U.S. and Americas from the third quarter and I think we feel pretty good about that, given the environment.", "Kevin talked a little bit about what drove some of that acceleration. We had a really good summer around innovation including limited time offers, Teavana Iced Tea, we had a pretty good quarter in food and Frappuccino recovered a bit and helped us as well. So while we didn't quite get to 5% in the U.S., it was pretty close. And I think as we look forward, I think mid-single-digit comps, if you look at the U.S. comp in the first quarter, it's 9% and the global comp is 8%. And so I think it's just prudent for us to say there's a range in mid-single-digit comps for a reason. And I think in the first half with those types of compares and the backdrop we have, I think we're just thinking we're going to be at the lower-end of that range. And, of course, as always if we can beat it, we will.", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "Can I add one thing? Without putting anyone on the defensive and recognizing this is like the third rail, I would just ask you to consider that for a company our size and the track record that we have had domestically and now internationally, and as Kevin said in his remarks, the fact that our business went up on our scale during this quarter in every day-part. And if you look at our history of trying to do everything we can to really add shareholder value in everything we do, to just try and just take a step back every now and then and recognize that comp store sales, although we all recognize its importance, is not the driving force of a company that did $20 billion in revenue and $4 billion in operating profit and is adding a store a day in China and is on its way to building one of the most recognized and admired brands in the world. And yet, we're so focused on something that, yes, it is important and it is strategic, but it is not everything.", "So just maybe every now and then recognize that we will have comps that will over-achieve and we'll have some comps that probably will disappoint. But we are here for the long game. This is a 24th year of our public life. The company had a market cap of $250 million at that point. It's at almost $80 billion today. And it's just the beginning. So maybe every now and then just recognize we're all in this together and comps is not the end all of everything.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim. Matthew, your line is now open.", "Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you. And I appreciate that commentary you gave on the comps. Actually, my question is with respect to that a little bit and the 2,100 stores, I would think a couple years ago you did point out that you mentioned three years ago about the changing dynamic and you spoke also about the changing in traffic for the consumer out there. I guess the 2,100 stores does sound like a very good number, a very strong number on a global basis. I wonder can you talk about that as far as what are the different type of \u2013 you talked about highest volumes in some of these markets as well. What is the biggest driver behind that? Is it the new products you're doing now? Is it the mobile app? Can you give us some color on what do you think is behind? Is it better real estate sites? Have you changed the way you select these sites on a global basis?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, thanks for the question, Matt. I'll give it a shot. I think if you go back five years ago or so into the mid-2000s when we were opening our highest number of stores, most of those stores were company-owned stores in the U.S. I want to say it was something like 80%. And now you look at where we're opening our stores today with 60% of those stores coming in markets outside of the U.S., two-thirds of those stores are licensed stores. And even end markets like China and the U.S. where we're opening significant numbers of company-owned stores, we're using different formats as we go into markets. And so, drive-thrus remain well over 50% of our stores.", "So we're going into different real estate than we were back then. We have smaller footprint stores. We have the larger footprint stores including Reserve bars that Howard talked about. So the toolset that we're using as we build stores out, both from a product offering standpoint with Reserve and flexibility for our customers with drive-thrus in international markets really helps us gain confidence with our store growth.", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "I would add one other thing. And as Kevin said in his remarks, the fact that on our base for the new store performance this year, both in the U.S. and China, the best performing class of new stores in our history. And then the other thing I'd say is we're opening stores now in places that 10 years ago, even five years ago, I don't think we would have considered. And we were in Inglewood outside of Chicago last week. We've opened in Jamaica, Queens and, of course, we're so proud of the fact that we've opened in Ferguson, Missouri. In all these cases, the stores are performing at or above plan as we recognize more than ever that there's a lot of white space and opportunities to extend the reach of Starbucks. So I don't know, Kevin, if you want to add anything?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, I think the strength of the brand and the fact there's latent demand in these markets for Starbucks. And so, we're very thoughtful about where we locate these stores. And the teams have put together a number of tools and things to ensure we're being thoughtful about where we locate stores but when we locate them, there's demand for those stores that shows up very quickly. And it's not cannibalizing existing stores. And that just shows that there's more customers we can reach and if we're thoughtful about how we do it, it strengthens the brand and strengthens the connection with the customer.", "John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, and I would just add that going back to what we learned during the transformation in 2007 and 2008, we've put in all new processes and all new ways in which we're evaluating real estate, evaluating new stores, monitoring the progress and making sure that they are in fact meeting the customer demand that's out there, the latent demand that Kevin spoke about. In addition, I would also say that the level of innovation from a product standpoint that we're bringing into our stores has never been stronger.", "And so you look at Cold Brew, you look at Nitro, you look at Teavana, you look at some of the food gains that we've had. We continue to innovate and then add in the digital footprint and being relevant to our customers from a digital standpoint. We are engaging our customers more now than we ever have, and the stores or that place where they come for their favorite Starbucks beverage each and every day.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Nicole, your line is now open.", "Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to understand a little bit more about the CPG trends with \u2013 and, again, an amazing operating margin there. Can you talk about the organic top-line growth from existing and new relationships and what kind of leverage that provides to operating margin? And then when you think about the grocery store price inflation or deflation, how does that impact operating margin and is the volume growth still outpacing revenue growth? Thank you.", "Michael Conway - Starbucks Corp.", "Hi, there. This is Mike Conway. I'll take that question. So from a top-line perspective, we're feeling good about the top-line performance that we've had certainly this quarter. If you look at our growth as measured by IRI both for our key businesses, Roast and Ground and K-Cup, we're up 8%. We're actually growing at a pace double that in the category. And that's really behind, number one, our strong brand. Number two, the great execution that we have on our holiday programs or LTL like Fall Blend and our innovation, and innovation that we have to come. So we feel very good about the kind of growth and share that we've been able to drive.", "And what I would say is that volume versus the price, our volume and price growth are fairly close which means that we've been able to really get the right balance of promotional pricing, base pricing in the marketplace and we feel good about that. If you look at that and the margin expansion that we've been able to realize in the quarter, I think that's kind of the right balance for us, to continue to grow both the category, grow our brand and also drive share.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Let me just add to Mike's comments. Nicole, this is Kevin. The CPG business, in many ways, is about scale economics. And so certainly the more we're gaining share in the grocery and mass merchants that we sell to, the more efficient we are at delivering that product. So that's helping. Number two, I'll remind you that we renegotiated our agreement with Keurig and so we've got favorable K-Cup tolling fees which are also helping. So there's a variety of things that are contributing to that but I think the strength of the brand and the share gains that we continue to get for at-home coffee, Roast and Ground as well as K-Cup and establishing Starbucks as the number one share player in premium Roast and Ground and K-Cups is a big part of that.", "Operator", "And your last question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI. Matt, your line is now open.", "Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI", "Thank you. My question's on the free cash generation this year in...", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "We can't hear you.", "Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI", "Can you hear me now?", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "Can you speak up a little louder?", "Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI", "Sure. Can you hear me?", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "Yes.", "Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI", "Sorry about that. So my question is on the free cash generation over 2016 and the cash balance you had at the year end. You had a very good step-up in that ability to generate cash in 2016. It was about $1 billion higher versus last year. So my question is how much of that step-up in the cash generation was driven by durable increases in cash conversion relative to more one-time things, like a 53rd week, or favorable year-end timing on working capital or things like that? I think the margin commentary that you gave for 2017 made it seem like that is probably durable. But I'm curious if those balances are as good as they look?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, the vast majority of the increase in cash is due to the core operating cash flow of the business. So that's a good thing.", "Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI", "Anything else?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "No.", "Thomas Shaw - Starbucks Corp.", "All right. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us today. And we look forward to seeing many of you at our December 7 Investor Day in New York.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.

This is Tom Shaw, Vice President of Investor Relations at Starbucks Corporation. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2017 results, which will be led by Howard Schultz, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Johnson, President and COO; and Scott Maw, CFO.", "Joining us for Q&A are John Culver, Group President, Starbucks Global Retail; Cliff Burrows, Group President, Siren Retail; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; Adam Brotman, EVP of Global Retail Ops; and Kris Engskov, who will discuss Global Channel Development.

Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, Tom, and welcome to everyone on today's call. Before I start the call, I want to acknowledge the recent passing of Joe Buckley. Joe had followed Starbucks from the start, from our IPO days in 1992. Over the years, Joe has been on countless calls just like this one, and for that reason, I felt it was the right forum to send my personal condolences to Joe's family and his colleagues. Joe was a really good man.", "I'm pleased to comment on the record financial and operating results Starbucks announced today. I'll start with a few highlights. Record revenues, record operating income, and record EPS, another quarter of strong comp growth in China, accelerating comps in Japan, record quarterly revenues, margins, and operating income from Channel Development, record Starbucks Rewards membership growth, and a record holiday, including record Starbucks new Card activations and reloads. I'm particularly pleased that we delivered these results, despite a very challenging period for restaurants and retailers overall, and despite the significant investments we continue to make in our people and in beverage, food, and technology innovation.", "Today Starbucks is serving more than 90 million customer occasions through over 258,000 stores in 75 countries each week. The trust and confidence our customers have in the Starbucks brand is driving our business and fueling our flywheel in markets and channels around the world as never before. Three years ago, I brought to your attention what I anticipated would be a seismic evolving shift in consumer behavior resulting from the rapid acceleration of digital and online consumer retail purchase activity.", "Today that shift is a foregone conclusion, increasingly challenging brick and mortar retailers of all descriptions and being particularly hard on retailers that are not destinations, do not reward loyalty or offer relative digital and online capabilities, or have not built deep authentic experiential connections to their customers.", "I think it's important to understand that the 3% comp figure we reported reflects the continued relevance and appeal of the Starbucks experience and how Starbucks continues to outperform by significant margins anyone else of scale in the retail and restaurant sectors. The fact is, Starbucks is engaging more deeply and more frequently and expanding our base of loyal customers everywhere in the world more effectively and reliably than ever before.", "We added a record 1.8 million Starbucks reward members in the U.S. year-over-year, and now have approximately 13 million active members on top of a growing 7.5 million active members in China and Asia-Pacific.", "We saw nothing short of a surge in new Starbucks Card activations and reloads in Q1 to $2.1 billion, almost $300 million over last year, with over $80 million being incremental to even our most optimistic internal expectations for the quarter, and we ended the quarter with over $1.5 billion of customer loaded funds on our balance sheet, roughly 10% above last year. This $1.5 billion represents future revenues in the bank for us that are not reflected in Q1 revenues or comps, since as you know we do not recognize new Card loads and reloads until the funds are redeemed. But unlike traditional retailers whose online and digital or omni-channel activity often times comes at a price discount or cannibalizes in-store or both, further pressuring business models, Starbucks do not. Digital or online Starbucks Card loads are never cannibalistic and are very often incremental because the funds can only be redeemed at face value in a Starbucks store. We're already seeing Q1 loads being redeemed in our stores and we'll continue to see further redemptions in the quarters ahead.", "We delivered record shattering Mobile Order & Pay performance metrics in Q1. Rapidly accelerating customer adoption of MOP, particularly over the last three months contributed to a growing number of stores being challenged to keep up with the increased volume demands and introduced an operational challenge that Kevin will speak to in his remarks. We are now laser focused on fixing this problem, but the nature of it, too much demand, is an operational challenge we have solved before, and I can assure you we will solve again.", "Beyond these factors, we have consistently said in achieving mid-single digit comps for the full fiscal 2017, our target we repeated at our Investor Day last month. Our expectation has been that comps in the back half of the year would reflect an acceleration from the front half. This remains our expectation as recently introduced new in-store business drivers, including true one to one personalization and real time suggested selling increasingly drive incrementality and revenues, and position us to extend the trend of our newest class of new and remodeled stores, defying current retail and consumer trends, and delivering record breaking revenues, profits and returns on investment both in the U.S. and around the world.", "With the benefit of these insights you can see that the momentum of our flywheel is enabling us to engage with our customers, and drive our business holistically, and more effectively, and profitably than ever before. Going forward, Starbucks values and guiding principles, the engaging third place sense of community we create, and the innovation and increasingly premiumized coffee experience we deliver will further deepen the connection among our partners, customers, and the Starbucks brand, and enable us to continue driving growth and increase profitability over both the short and long terms around the world. In our view, no brick and mortar retailer of any description is better positioned to navigate and profit from the ongoing consumer shifts under way than Starbucks.", "In a few minutes, Kevin will provide details around segment operating performance in Q1 and provide further detail around the new innovations and initiatives that will drive revenues, comps, and EPS in the quarters ahead, and Scott will take you through our Q1 financial results, provide Q2 targets, and our targets for the full fiscal year, and we'll move on to Q&A.", "Global leadership around all things coffee and tea remains at Starbucks' core. Our Seattle Roastery continues to deliver company leading comp growth, including 18% in Q1, on top of 24% in Q4 of 2016. Due in large part to a ticket that continues to be approximately four times the ticket of traditional Starbucks store, and serve as a learning lab for retail beverage and food innovation, and the launch pad of our ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve brand. We're on plan to open our Shanghai Roastery later this year, and our New York Roastery in 2018 and our Tokyo Roastery will be right behind.", "And in Q1 we made great strides against our plans to further premiumize the coffee industry through the addition of what will ultimately be 1,000 or more coffee forward ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores in key global markets, with the first Reserve store opening in Chicago this summer. We're already leveraging elements of the Roastery and the new Reserve store format by integrating Reserve bars into existing Starbucks stores. The overwhelmingly positive customer response we're having to the Reserve bars already opened, and the incremental revenues and profits Reserve bars are driving, is prompting us to accelerate plans to add Reserve bars into thousands of existing Starbucks stores as part of planned renovation cycles in the quarters and years ahead. Reserve stores and Reserve bars in existing Starbucks stores will enable us to provide customers with a unique ultra-premium coffee experience and showcase the finest assortments of exclusive Starbucks Reserve micro-lot single varietal coffees, and create new coffee brewing methods through an intimate one-to-one partner customer experience that takes place as the barista crafts and explains the custom handcrafted beverage.", "In addition, Reserve stores will offer customers artisanal foods specially created by our partners at Italian artisanal baker Princi, as well as craft beer, wine, and alcoholic beverages that will be incremental to our evening daypart informed by the learning from our evening's program tests. And both Reserve and traditional Starbucks stores will also offer handcrafted Teavana branded beverages and an expanded assortment of Teavana teas in order to increase customer awareness of Teavana super premium loose leaf and packaged teas.", "Perhaps nowhere in the world is the power of the Starbucks brand and the size of opportunity that lies ahead for us more evident than in China, a country we first entered 18 years ago, and where our business has never been stronger or more robust. We now have over 2,600 stores in 125 cities in China, and continue to open a new store every 15 hours, a rate of new store growth that will continue for years to come. I'm more convinced than ever that Starbucks is just getting started in China, and that our Shanghai Roastery will drive both deeper and broader customer engagement and increase profitability across both our retail and CPG businesses, and it will advance Starbucks' reputation, being among the most, if not the most successful and well respected western brands in the key China market.", "The Starbucks brand and business have never been stronger or more universally relevant and accepted as both are today, and our world class senior leadership team with Kevin at the helm as CEO effective in April, has never been stronger. We will continue playing the long game with strict adherence to the five-year strategic plan for growing our business we updated and outlined at our Investor Day in order to continue delivering the world-leading financial and operating performance, including mid-single digit global comps and long-term sustainable profitable growth, and that unmatched ground breaking innovation that our customers and our people expect from us.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide an overview of business segment performance and highlight some of the key initiatives that are under way. I will then turn the call over to Scott to take us through the financials and our targets for Q2.", "At our Investor Day in December, we outlined a multiyear plan to further elevate the Starbucks brand, elevate our customer experience, and ultimately amplify Starbucks as a consumer destination around the world. We also reaffirmed our strategic priorities over the next five years and provided more clarity around our ongoing investments in retail, beverage, and digital innovation, as well as in our partners. Looking ahead, we believe that our clear, long range planning, combined with ongoing innovation and a heightened commitment to excellence and execution will enable the creation of meaningful shareholder value.", "Despite the challenging macro retail environment, Starbucks delivered record revenues, operating margins, and profits in Q1. Each of our business segments contributed to our overall global results, and I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through our performance by geography and segment. Let's begin with the Americas.", "Our Americas segment had a solid quarter, posting 3% comp growth with 3% comp in the U.S., and 7% revenue growth. Americas added about 250 net new stores in the quarter, and now operates almost 16,000 stores. When analyzing the 3% comp growth in the U.S., there are four major points to capture both the strength of the brand and the opportunities to further accelerate comp store growth.", "First, our beverage category performance was strong. We delivered great hot and cold beverage innovation to our customers, contributing to a total beverage sales increase of 7%. Core beverage contributed one point of comp, and tea grew by nearly 10% in the U.S. and 15% globally. Iced espresso, iced coffee, and handcrafted Teavana shake and iced teas each posted strong double-digit growth. We continue to introduce new Cold Brew varietals and expand our store deployment of Nitro Cold Brew.", "Second, our food sales were also strong, growing 8% year-on-year, contributing one point of comp, driven mainly by improved attach across all dayparts with continued strength in the morning. Food represents 20% of our total sales, with breakfast sandwich revenues growing 16%, bringing the two-year growth rate to 69%. Sales of premium breakfast sandwiches increased 52%.", "A third point I'd like to make is the surge in Starbucks gift cards and reloads, both digitally and online. The $2.1 billion of card sales and reloads is a reflection of the strength of our brand, as well as the power of our digital flywheel, which leads to the fourth point. Digital flywheel adoption continues to grow, with almost 13 million active Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S., up 16% from the same period a year ago. Starbucks Rewards as a percentage of tender is up 4 points from a year ago to 34%, and mobile payment increased to 20% of total transactions. This is up 2 points from last quarter and represents an accelerating trend, driven by the success of Mobile Order & Pay.", "Total member spend increased 21% year-on-year, driven in part by the strong early success of our recently launched personalization capabilities. Mobile Order & Pay had a banner quarter, representing more than 7% of total transactions, double the figure from Q1 last year, and we now have nearly 1200 stores with 20% or more Mobile Order & Pay transactions at peak, compared to only 13 stores one year ago. The overwhelming success of Mobile Order & Pay has increased Rewards engagement and created efficiencies at point of sale.", "But as Howard mentioned, the success of Mobile Order & Pay has also created a new operational challenge that has been building in lock step with volume growth, and it's most pronounced in our highest volume stores at peak, significant congestion at the handoff plane. This congestion resulted in some number of customers who either entered the store or considered visiting a Starbucks store and then did not complete a transaction. Adam Brotman is already driving action in our top 1,000 highest volume Mobile Order & Pay stores to address this issue, including introducing new in-store procedures and tools, adding new roles and resources to specifically support Mobile Order & Pay, and the testing of new digital enhancements, including text message notifications when a mobile order is ready for pickup.", "Our in-store operational approach continues to evolve as we handle larger volumes of transactions. I will point out that we have been confronted with and solved complexities like this that have been introduced by rapid volume and traffic growth many times over the past several years, and we will solve the challenges presented by Mobile Order & Pay driven traffic increases now.", "I want to highlight additional plans we have in place to drive comps to mid-single digits for the full year. These actions align with the five-year strategic plan and are focused on near-term comp growth. First, product innovation. In beverage, we are building a broader beverage platform around Nitro and other Cold Brew offerings complemented by innovation around Frappuccino and Teavana iced teas.", "Regarding food innovation, we introduced delicious, healthy, high-protein, Sous Vide Egg Bites this month that have been extremely well received and are driving both incremental revenue and increased attach. We are expanding production capacity to meet incremental demand for these egg bites. We're also launching the highly-anticipated gluten free breakfast sandwich soon.", "As we discussed at Investor Day, we have a growth opportunity in the lunch daypart with innovation around a fresh, healthy lunch concept that will be tested in the Chicago market this summer in Starbucks stores. Digital flywheel innovation is a critical part of the plan. In addition to ongoing improvements in personalization, including increasing triggered offers based on customers' recent Rewards activity, we are also rolling out suggestive selling that will recommend items to a customer during the order process. The voice enabled ordering capability we demonstrated at Investor Day will begin deployment in the coming months.", "To accelerate our progress implementing this plan, John Culver, who leads Starbucks Global Retail, made a leadership change in the U.S. with Kris Engskov, a 14-year partner, who most recently led EMEA, assuming leadership of our U.S. retail business reporting to John. Kris was an operator in the U.S. retail business prior to his assignment leading EMEA, and it's great to have him back in the U.S. retail. In addition, I've asked Howard to act as a coach to Kris as we focus on energizing and galvanizing our store managers and field leadership around the many growth initiatives rolling out now and in the quarters ahead.", "Tony Matta, who currently leads our U.S. CPG business will succeed Kris leading global channel development. Tony brings 20 years of experience in the CPG industry and has done a fantastic job leading the Starbucks U.S. CPG business.", "Let's move on to China Asia-Pacific. In Q1, CAP once again Starbucks fastest growing segment with revenues up 18% and comp sales up 5%. We added approximately 300 net new stores in CAP in the quarter, and now operate 6,700 stores across 15 countries. Our newest class of company operated stores in China continues the trend of outperforming even the most recent prior class, reflecting both the increasing strength of the Starbucks brand in the region and improved operating leverage. And we celebrated a milestone in Q1 by opening our 1,000th store in Korea. Korea now joins China and Japan as countries in CAP with over 1,000 Starbucks stores. We remain on plan to have roughly 11,000 locations in CAP by 2021. We opened over 160 new Starbucks stores in China in the quarter. We now operate over 2,600 stores in China and remain on plan to have over 5,000 stores by 2021.", "Comps in China grew 6% in the quarter, with 4% increase in traffic. We continue to build the China digital flywheel with active members growing over 25% year-on-year and the new partnership with Tencent showing phenomenal results. WeChat Pay already represents 20% of total transactions in China and the soft launch of WeChat social gifting to 4 million Starbucks customers in China has generated overwhelming attention. Social gifting is the next frontier of our digital flywheel.", "In addition, Teavana continued to perform well throughout CAP with tea revenues growing over 40% in both Japan and China following the launch of custom handcrafted Teavana beverages sold at Starbucks. The passion and commitment of our partners in CAP is enabling a great Starbucks experience that is deepening our connection with customers and driving our business throughout the region.", "Let's move on to EMEA. EMEA continues to see success from the repositioning of its store portfolio, with system comps growing 3%. We opened approximately 100 net new stores in the quarter and now operate over 2,700 EMEA stores, only 18% of which are company operated. Non-equity stores are driving our performance, despite an increasingly challenging operating environment. Reported total revenues in Q1 decreased 16% year-on-year to $262 million in EMEA. However, when adjusted for the 21% impact of foreign exchange, the sale of 35 stores to franchisees and local licensees in the UK, and the transfer of 144 stores in Germany to AmRest, an existing EMEA license partner, revenue growth was 5%. We remain confident in our strategy and long-term prospects for EMEA.", "On to Channel Development. Channel Development delivered record revenue, up 8% year-on- year, on top of a very strong 16% increase in Q1 a year ago. We continued our strong track record of growth as measured by total U.S. coffee consumption in Q1. Starbucks K-Cups posted sales growth of 10.3%, six times the total K-Cup category growth of only 1.7%. We are the market share leader in this category at 17.7%.", "Starbucks is also the number-one premium Roast and Ground packaged coffee brand. Our Roast and Ground sales grew 6% in the quarter, compared to total packaged coffee category decline of 1.6%. This contributed a point of share, taking us to a 14% share position. As we mentioned at Investor Day, while we expect to see continued deceleration in the category and increased competition for both Roast and Ground and K-Cup, we will continue to innovative, gain share, and drive growth.", "Turning to our Ready-to-Drink business. Our NACP partnership delivered excellent results with system sales, as measured by IRI, up 8%. Share of the total liquid coffee and energy segment grew to 14%, fueled by strength in bottled Frappuccino, Doubleshot energy drink and new chilled multi-serve products. We continue to expand our CPG footprint. In EMEA, Starbucks Nespresso compatible capsules have already become the number three brand in the Nespresso compatible capsule category in the UK. In China, Starbucks Frappuccino is now available for purchase at over 21,000 points of distribution, enabled by our partner, Tingyi. And in the U.S., our partner, Anheuser-Busch Inbev begins the rollout of new Teavana ready-to-drink teas in February.", "In our 25 years as a public company, our aspirations have never been higher and our opportunities never greater. As we pursue our multi-year plan, we will remain true to our mission and core values and a commitment of serving others and sharing success.", "In closing, I want to personally thank the more than 300,000 partners around the world who proudly wear the green apron for the work they do every single day in our stores. Ultimately, it is our partners who delivered the record results we announced today.", "With that, I'll hand over the call to Scott to take you through our Q1 financials in detail. Scott?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks record first quarter fiscal 2017 results once again demonstrate strong financial and operating performance in the face of a challenging environment. We delivered solid top line and bottom line growth in the quarter, despite investing meaningfully in innovation and in our partners to support and strengthen our brand and business going forward.", "Consolidated operating margin came in at 19.8% on a GAAP basis, and 20% on a non-GAAP basis. The 10 basis point improvement in operating margin over Q1 last year was driven primarily by sales leverage and favorability in commodity costs, principally coffee, that more than offset increased partner investments, largely in our Americas segment. We saw strong leverage on cost of goods sold, once again in Q1, giving us great confidence that our long-term goal of $1.4 billion in COG savings is achievable. Q1 GAAP EPS grew 11% to $0.51, which is a record when the large one time gain associated with the Starbucks Japan acquisition is excluded from our Q1 results two years ago. Q1 non-GAAP EPS grew 13% to $0.52, also a Q1 record. I'll now take you through our Q1 operating performance by segment starting with the Americas.", "Our Americas segment delivered operating income of $959 million in Q1, a 3% increase over last year. Operating margin declined 110 basis points to 24%, largely due to increased store operating expenses attributable to increased U.S. store partner investments. As mentioned last quarter, we are investing an incremental $250 million globally this year in overall partner and digital investments, with the bulk occurring in partner wages and benefits in the U.S.", "The full impact of our partner investments in Q1 was partially offset by increased sales leverage. As Kevin mentioned, Starbucks digital flywheel continues to gain momentum and drive our business. We are now approaching the spend and profitability for Starbucks rewards member levels we had forecast when we switched from a frequency based to a spend based loyalty model last April. We expect further improvement in these critical metrics over the course of the year. We now expect Americas operating margin to be roughly flat to 2016 levels for fiscal 2017.", "Let's move on to China Asia-Pacific. CAP once again delivered the strongest top line growth of any of our operating segments 18% over last year, while delivering record quarterly GAAP operating income of $163 million, up 29% over Q1 of last year. CAP's operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 21.2%. On a non-GAAP basis, CAP's operating income increased by 27% to $177 million, and its operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 23%.", "Contributing to CAP's margin expansion was the transition to a value-added tax structure in China and outstanding performance from our joint venture operations in the region, partially offset by 110 basis points of negative impact related to FX. For the full year, we continue to expect moderate operating margin expansion in CAP, and are optimistic that we will exceed our initial operating margin plans despite the increasingly negative impact of foreign exchange. Also, CAP revenue growth adjusted for foreign exchange will remain in the mid-teens all year. Reported revenue growth in this segment will be meaningfully impacted by foreign exchange as we move through the year, with an estimated 3 full points of negative impact on revenue growth for the year.", "Let's move on to EMEA. Despite continuing economic, geopolitical, retail and FX headwinds, EMEA delivered among the strongest operating margins in its history in Q1, 16.8%, up 140 basis points over last year, once again validating the correctness of our strategy to optimize our EMEA store profitability by shifting to a predominantly licensed model. As Kevin mentioned, systems sales, systems revenue, and overall profitability are running much higher in EMEA today under the largely licensed store portfolio approach when compared to the prior company owned market model. It's important to note that EMEA operating income grew by 6% after adjusting for the nearly $7 million impact of negative foreign exchange in the quarter. With such a strong start to the year, we continue to expect EMEA operating margins to reach nearly 15% for the full fiscal year.", "Starbucks Channel Development segment continues to lead the premium coffee category in both Roast and Ground and on the K-Cup platform, gaining share in all U.S. categories in at-home and Ready-to-Drink, while at the same time, delivering record quarterly operating margin and profit. And despite an increasingly competitive operating environment, Channel Development's operating income reached $243 million, up 26% year-over-year, on a 620 basis point increase in operating margin to 43.9%. Margin improvement was driven primarily by favorability in coffee costs, higher income for our North American coffee partnership with Pepsi, and sales leverage on cost of goods sold, and operating expenses. For the full fiscal year 2017, we continue to expect Channel Development to post full year revenue growth in the high single-digits, though Q2 growth is likely to be at a slightly slower rate, given the timing and impact of the Easter holiday, which occurred in Q2 last year, but falls in Q3 this year, and we continue to expect Channel Development to drive strong operating margin improvement in fiscal 2017 over last year with expected very strong expansion in the first half of the year, but moderating a bit over the last two quarters.", "I want to make one last point on the quarter related to capital deployment. Cash returned to shareholders increased 42% from Q1 of last year to nearly $800 million, a Q1 record.", "Let's move to 2017 targets. We are reiterating the financial and operating targets we previously provided for fiscal 2017 with a slight modification to our total revenue growth goal. To achieve these targets, we are committed to remaining disciplined with our investments and laser focused on delivering an elevated experience to our customers, while at the same time, meaningfully improving our comps, revenue, and profit in the second half of 2017. This discipline will be key to delivering our top and bottom line goals. Specifically, on a 52-week basis we now expect foreign exchange adjusted revenue to grow at 8% to 10% compared to fiscal 2016. We believe broadening this range is prudent, given the 7% revenue growth we posted this holiday quarter. This includes global comp growth in the mid-single digit range, with the first half of the year lower and some improvement in the second half of the year.", "We plan to add 2,100 net new stores globally, including approximately 1,000 in China Asia-Pacific, 800 in the Americas, and 300 in EMEA. On a 52-week basis, we continue to expect slight improvement in consolidated operating margin compared to fiscal 2016. This margin expansion is the strong result, given the twin pressures of foreign exchange and increased partner and digital investments.", "With our coffee needs for 2017 approximately 80% price locked, we do not expect commodities to materially impact our year-over-year profit growth. Commodities, in total, will be slightly favorable in the first half of the year and slightly unfavorable in the back half. Also, given recent movement in currency exchange rates, we now expect an increased negative impact from foreign exchange for the year, with revenue growth now impacted by roughly 1 point, and earnings per share negatively impacted by 1 point to 2 points. The impact of FX will accelerate as we move into the last half of 2017. You will note that this is a meaningful increase from our last guidance relative to the impact of FX.", "Given all these points, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS in the range of $2.09 to $2.11, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.12 to $2.14. Specifically looking at Q2 2017, we are targeting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.43 to $0.44 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.44 to $0.45. All other guidance is unchanged from last quarter.", "We are pleased with the record operating and financial results we announced today, particularly given that the results were delivered in conjunction with a significant increase in investments in our people and innovation. More importantly, as you heard from Kevin, we have a clear set of actions that we believe will improve comp growth and profitability as we move through the year. As always, credit for our success in Q1 belongs to Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the green apron and work to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers through 90 million individual occasions every week, but who do so with heart and passion, one cup at a time.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And our first question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. John, your line is now open.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much. I wonder if I could just maybe ask two guidance related questions, Scott or Howard. First is just with the context of the lower revenue growth, can you just break out between the foreign currency and what your expectations are comps at the beginning of the year versus now? Is that evenly split or how do you break those down? And then there was discussion at the Analyst Day of growing G&A at half the rate of revenue, and I wonder if that's in play this year and how that plays out, because G&A growth was substantially more than that in the first quarter, and I know that's probably the investment timing, but just is the half of revenue rate still in play this year?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, I'll take those in order, John. So, as far as revenue growth goes, we're really still on that double-digit track that we talked about. It's just, given the performance in the first quarter which, as you know, was 7%, both adjusted for FX and as reported. We just see the math averaging out to perhaps a little bit below that rate, depending on how we finish. But we still expect comps to accelerate in the back half of the year, which means revenue will accelerate in the back half of the year and the number I'm giving, that 8% to 10% growth rate, that excludes the impact of FX, which we think, based upon where rates are today, will be about one point negative. So, hopefully that answers that modeling question.", "On G&A growth, what we talked about was G&A growth excluding the investments we had in innovation, which is primarily things around the digital flywheel and things we're doing with Siren Retail. That will grow at half the rate of G&A, or half the rate of revenue. And when you strip out one-time items, some of those investments that we're talking about, we were really close to that this quarter. So, we're still on track for G&A \u2013 core G&A growing at half the rate of revenue for the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital. David, your line is now open.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks, good evening. You mentioned the issue with the congestion at the handoff for those mobile orders. How much of a drag do you think that represented during the quarter? And any color about the nature of the friction, where was it greatest and how quickly could you solve the issue would be helpful. Thanks.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, David, this is Kevin. I'll give you a little bit of more perspective on this. If you look at stores that had more than 20% of their transaction volume coming from Mobile Order & Pay at peak, this quarter we had 1,200 stores in the U.S. that fit that profile. Last quarter, it was 600 stores, so it's doubled in this last quarter. So, there's significant uptick in the usage of Mobile Order & Pay, and we've now \u2013 to the point where we doubled the number of stores that had more than 20% of their transaction volume coming in at peak. Now, what that creates is, when those orders come in at that volume, it's creating congestion at the handoff plane. And so, when a customer \u2013 a potential customer might walk in the store, it used to be they would look at the line at the point of sale, and if that line looked too long, they might decide not to do a transaction at that time and come back later. Now when customers walk into the store, we've alleviated the congestion at the point of sale line and now we have congestion at the handoff plane. So, they might look at the number of customers around the handoff plane and the number of beverages on the handoff plane, and that might create the signal to them that they are going to wait to do their transaction.", "We can't specifically quantify the number. We do think that was the most significant contributing factor to our 3% comp. So, it is something that over the last five years or six years we've had to continuously solve problems of the increased scaling of transactions in our store. This is no different. And so we are focused on a set of solutions. Adam Brotman is on point for those solutions, and maybe I'll hand over to Adam to walk through the set of things that you have in motion now and kind of where you're going with the action plan. So, Adam?", "Adam B. Brotman - Starbucks Corp.", "Thanks, Kevin. David, to answer your second question, we're getting after this right now. So, as this surge occurred in MOP, Mobile Order & Pay adoption, at those 1,200 stores that Kevin just mentioned, we studied right away which of those stores developed practices and systems for alleviating that congestion, and alleviating the balk and improving the throughput and making a smoother customer experience. And so, we took those practices right away, we rolled them together and we started rolling them out this week to those 1,200 stores and they include everything from two new barista roles that help simplify and clarify exactly how to organize and connect with customers and smooth out the congestion at the handoff plane. We are redeploying, and at times surgically adding labor into those stores to accommodate those roles, but really, it's just about getting after a better deployment method for those barista roles in those stores. And we've added new station \u2013 ticket station, layout guides and other tools that make the experience easier and better for our partners, and we know these work in the stores that we've studied and we're putting that into action right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Sara, your line is now open.", "Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the record Starbucks Card activations and reloads, and just ask if you could talk about what you think that means in the context of slightly softer comps this quarter. So specifically, is this sort of just a timing shift when you think about traffic, fewer people out doing holiday shopping maybe, but in the end, the traffic patterns will come back in the March quarter? Or is this something else that's going on? And, I guess, on a related note, in light of the traffic shift, how are you thinking about delivery, which is an area that so many restaurants now are talking about, focusing intently on as a way to maybe counteract what looks like just less footfall out there?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Hey, Sara, it's Scott. I'll start and I'll ask Matt Ryan to help a bit. Look, as far as the Card loads, that record level of activity, that will come through, sitting on the balance sheet will absolutely come through as we move into January and beyond this quarter. In fact, we're already seeing that happen. I think the important thing to understand is the challenges that Kevin talked about and the opportunity we have with throughput. Adam is working on that. That solve will take a little bit of time. We'll get started on it this quarter, but my guess is, turning that around takes a bit of time. So, while all that Card load activity is going to come through, and that's going to be positive, we still have to address that throughput opportunity we have in our stores.", "Matt, do you want to add?", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, I think the good news in all of that is the terrific results we're seeing related to reloads in particular. That's testament to the digital flywheel working on all fronts right now, as you heard from Howard and Kevin, there is record performance, and it's coming from both the number of members we have and the acquisition activities that have taken place, as well as from spend per member, which is a function of three basic things. The transition that we successfully made to a spend-based model, which encourages higher spending; personalization, part and parcel with that and our ability to incentivize, purchases that may not have otherwise happened; as well as the impact of Mobile Order & Pay. So, we feel good about all of that. I just want to address the one last question about delivery that you also raised as well, too.", "Where we see the greatest opportunity for delivery as we outlined at investment day is in China, where the cost of delivery has come in at a price point that customers are willing to pay, and we will be looking to engage and make that happen. So, you'll see more of that in months to come, as we get results from our pilots back. We're also exploring other opportunities in the U.S., but we don't have anything specific to announce at this time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John, your line is now open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Thank you. Two questions, if I may. Firstly, listening to some of the prepared remarks, I mean, there's obviously a lot of I think rightful optimism around the $2.1 billion loaded on the Starbucks Card as a balance ending the quarter. Some of the food doing very well, specifically around the egg bites.", "But I guess the one piece that maybe hasn't been fully developed yet is one to one marketing, and customized offers being made immediately to the customer. So, I guess it's on that last point, and Matt, maybe the question is for you. When do you think that begins to have an impact? Especially for the 80% of stores, presumably that don't have the capacity constraint at the handoff, in other words, driving additional spend at the stores that aren't constrained? And I have a follow-up.", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Sure, thanks for the question. I think the result you saw in spend per member going up so dramatically in the past quarter and so on as a result of the first wave of personalization kicking in. Remember that it was about at the beginning of last quarter that we started personalization, not just in email, but also in the app itself, so that there were mobile offers being featured to the customer, and we saw tremendous response rates there versus what we had done previously in email, which already had been higher than what we had done without one-to-one, so that ramp was already taking place. We're optimistic that we're also layering what we call recommendations right now that is rolling out this month, and what that means is as customers are in the process of ordering we will be doing suggestive selling, so that was not in past results, but should be in this quarter, and future quarters to come. There's a long roadmap in front of us with personalization. We've only just begun that journey, and we're very, very optimistic about the contribution it's already making to the spend per member that we're seeing.", "Operator", "Your next question.", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "John, you had a follow-up? No?", "Operator", "Pardon me. Your next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Sharon, your line is now open.", "Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi, good afternoon. I guess the question is, given the success of Mobile Order & Pay, can you talk about how that's informing your new store design? And as you think about that, structurally, is there anything that you would go back and want to retrofit throughout the system, particularly in the U.S.?", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "This is Howard. I'll start with that. It's interesting you asked that question, because we have many of our designers and architects in Seattle this week from the U.S. and around the world speaking about Reserve stores, Reserve bars, and the hot topic of the day, obviously, which is the unbelievable surprised success of Mobile Order & Pay and the impact it's had on the morning ritual. So, a few things.", "One, in existing stores, we, as Adam said, we have discovered that managers on their own have created best practices in order to solve the problem, and are creating, in a sense, a mobile kiosk that they can move around to try and establish a handoff plane, but we're going to redesign new stores and existing remodels to reflect the fact that Mobile Order & Pay, although it's in its nascent stage, is obviously going to be a significant part of the morning business. So, I want to bring some color to it also in my own way.", "When we introduced this, I don't think we had any idea that we would get the kind of response that we have gotten so fast, and as Kevin said, the ramp-up that we are now seeing has significantly affected the morning ritual, and at times, created anxiety among existing customers. And \u2013 but at the same time, this is a great problem to have, and a problem that we know how to solve. This is not rocket science. This is what we do every day, as retailers, as merchants, and we are in this thing right now, deeply trying to understand specifically what we can do on an interim basis, and what we can do over the long term.", "But the Mobile Order & Pay activity and the nascent stage of personalization and one-to-one marketing bode so well for the growth and development of the company, especially in light of the macro issue of traffic. And I think as I said in my prepared remarks, there's such evidence for us that we are going to be one of the true winners, regardless of what happens with those retailers, and especially those retailers that are going to suffer significantly from the downturn of traffic, as a result of e-commerce and mobile purchasing online. But I think we're in a unique position. Obviously, it affected comps this quarter. But it's a very good problem to solve, and then when you look at the $2 billion loaded on Cards that are sitting on the balance sheet for Starbucks, I mean, is there a company \u2013 is there a retail company, a retail brand, that is in this kind of position? And I said in my remarks, if you just look at the fact that we could not book that revenue in terms of traffic and comps, it's a much different story for Q1 than what we reported.", "John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.", "Howard, can I just add one other thing? This is John. Sharon, beyond the Mobile Order & Pay and the future design of the stores, we're looking at other areas as well for improvement, such as the cold beverage station, as we add in more cold beverages, iced tea, Nitro improvements to include infusion. We're also looking at enhanced food offering, and building out a more robust food capability within our stores. And then we continually look at and we shared with you at the investor conference the beverage innovation and the equipment innovation that we have coming on beverage, as well.", "So, Mobile Order & Pay is a piece of that and the deployment of that clearly, but then also we have other things that we're working on in terms of future design of the stores. And all this is designed around the principle of creating a higher and better partner-customer connection, and building that customer service aspect at a much higher level into our stores.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John, your line is now open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you so much for the follow-up. I do appreciate it very much. So, the question is for you, Scott. It's a little bit of a model question. Cost of goods sold leverage in the U.S. has obviously been a pretty important piece of the model over the past couple of years, especially as labor costs have risen, and in this quarter, it looks like it was relatively flat in the Americas year-over-year. So, I just wanted to get some color on that result, and if you expect future leverage in that obviously very important line going forward, even with commodities beginning to tick up?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, we do expect future leverage. One thing to remember, John, and I know you know this that includes COGS and occupancy, so there's a little bit of offsetting direction in those two-line items within cost of goods sold and occupancy, but we had nice leverage really across the globe and in the U.S. as well on cost of goods sold.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies. Andy, your line is now open.", "Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC", "Yeah, a question for Howard, please, on Reserve. I guess, I'm wondering if it works with the core brand given the pricing, the menu pricing is going to be higher in Reserve stores. Do you think eventually that gives you some room to move the umbrella up on your core brand pricing?", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "I don't think so. I think that our objective is to create a ultra-premium experience with Reserve in traditional Starbucks stores with Reserve bars, Reserve stores only, and obviously, the Roastery. But I don't think it's going to be a opportunity to raise prices in our core stores or core brand. But I think the differential between the ultra-premium experience of Reserve, we like the position that we're currently in, and our customers are responding very positively, as many people saw before the Investor Day at Brookfield Place. And I think I'm very encouraged, because outside of New York City, where we're opening stores, we're seeing a lot of traction with the number of Reserve beverages that are being sold, and the frequency of visits of customers coming back for a hand-crafted experience.", "Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is now open.", "Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Yeah, thanks. Just want to circle back on your comment, Scott, about the guidance for the year. When you said still sticking with mid-single digits, but you said below that, or I guess somewhat softer in the first half, are you saying that not mid-single digits in the first half, and then recovering to that level in the second half? Or are you saying more something a little different, if you could explain things?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "I think something a little different. I think, what we're sticking to is full year guidance of mid-single digits, and that the first half will be a bit lower than the second half. I want to try to stay away from giving comp guidance for each quarter, as you can imagine. Part of the first half is obviously impacted by the three that we just reported, but I think the thing to focus on is accelerating comps, revenue, and profitability in the back half of the year. That's really important for our guidance. And I would just add, all the things that Kevin talked about in his prepared remarks is what gives us line of sight to that, all the things around product innovation, many things that we're really just starting on the digital flywheel, and in the operational improvements, which will pick up over time and over the course of the year, and impact overall comps.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. David, your line is now open.", "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi, good afternoon. My question is coming back on the comps performance in the quarter, and in the holiday season, in particular. I appreciate the commentary around the bottlenecks on throughput being an issue, but, Howard, as you mentioned, the retail and restaurant environment looked very challenged in December, perhaps for a number of reasons, including the seismic shift that you've called out repeatedly. So, I was wondering if you thought that was also part of the issue. Or was it truly only related to the bottleneck? So, I guess asked differently, was there an issue in December that was more macro, that might not carry forward into the rest of the year?", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "I want to be very thoughtful about how I answer this. I think clearly, if you look at the results post-Black Friday, when there were headlines across the country that this was the first time I think in the history of U.S. retail that we saw more money being spent online than in traditional bricks and mortar retail. So, that unto itself was a signal that the holiday season for the first time was going to be bifurcated in a broader way.", "Having said that, we still believe that the holiday season, for us, was not significantly affected by the downturn in traffic. It was more the things that we've already discussed that are in our control, and in a sense, the self-induced issue of the success of Mobile Order & Pay. If that did not exist, I think we'd have a different story here today. And for us, as retailers, we want to be in a position where we are in control of the things that we can control, and we can't control weather, we can't control the downturn in traffic, but we can control the experience we create, the relationship we have with our customers and our partners. And if you look at the thing \u2013 you know what, the thing that I think I'm trying all the time to ask myself, and that is the ongoing reservoir of trust and relevancy of the Starbucks brand and experience, I think the primary data point is, look how many customers and how many dollars were bought with regard to reloads on existing people's accounts on phones and in gift cards. And it's a record number, especially when you look at the backdrop of the retail restaurant sector and the fact that most people had a very poor holiday. That, to me, is the primary indicator of the health of the brand, the health of the experience and the ongoing relevancy of the company and the confidence we have in what we've stated to-date.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is now open.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, another one on G&A and maybe approaching it a little bit differently. If you look at the trailing 12 months of G&A, we've seen sort of the year-over-year increase in that number ramp really significantly in the last really two quarters or three quarters. Carrying any version of that sort of run rate going forward, I don't know how you would get \u2013 just the math doesn't work on your operating margin guidance versus your revenue guidance. So, just trying to understand. I know there's some one-time stuff in there. Do absolute dollars of G&A come down from where we are right now? Or when does that trajectory start to bend down a little bit?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, thanks, Karen. You'll see the G&A growth rate come down, in general, as we move to the back half of the year, but I think, the thing \u2013 it's really important that I reiterate how we've talked about G&A growth. Because of the fact that our digital investments go through G&A because we're a retailer, our digital investments, all the things around flywheel, all the things we're doing with Reserve and Roastery, a lot of that cost, particularly as we get it up and running under Cliff Burrows, those head count costs all go through G&A. We're splitting our G&A into the core G&A that we all know, in finance and HR and legal and all those costs, and we're managing that bucket to half of revenue.", "The other dollars, which by the way, the total isn't that big of a piece of G&A, but it is growing much faster, well over double-digits. That's the piece that we're looking at as an investment. And so, that's why I want to bifurcate that. And if you take out the one timers in that significant investment that runs through G&A for us, we're below revenue growth rate in G&A, and I think that number will get better as we get throughout the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Bernstein from Barclays Capital. Jeff, your line is now open.", "Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much. Just maybe two questions. One, I was just wondering if you could talk about the Americas, specifically around the U.S., in terms of dayparts. I mean, it seems like when you break down the components, you were pleased with the results. And then I'm just wondering if you could break down maybe the strongest and the weakest, or maybe how you respond to the weakest. I thought I saw some article about \u2013 I know you mentioned the evening daypart, maybe that's on the softer side, perhaps, I know there were some reference to the alcohol testing pulled back, so maybe the evening is more the biggest opportunity.", "And my other question was just on the MSR. I mean, I think you now said you're up to 13 million members. I'm just wondering, I think at the Analyst Day, you told us you have 75 million total customers. So, I'm just wondering how do we get that 13 million, which I think you said already grew 16% this quarter. And I'm wondering if that's where you expected it to be at this point or how we get that number to even ramp up more quickly from here?", "John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.", "Okay. Jeff, this is John, just real quick. The growth on the dayparts was pretty evenly distributed across all dayparts. And so we saw good growth in the morning. We saw good growth at lunch and then in the afternoon and into the early evening. And when I say good growth, each of those dayparts grew year-over-year over 5%, approximately.", "When you look at the individual categories within that, which Kevin highlighted in his comments, beverage was a 7% year-over-year increase, which contributed a full point to our comp performance. We saw tea grow over 10% across the Americas. And we had huge success as it relates to iced beverages, in general, to include tea, as well as coffee, Cold Brew, Nitro, et cetera.", "Food, on a year-over-year basis grew 8%, and that contributed a full point of comp, as well. And, in particular, from a food standpoint, we saw strong growth in the morning daypart, particularly up against beverage, sandwiches, and that grew about 16%. And then the premium sandwiches that we offered as the LTOs during the holiday season grew over 52% on a year-over-year basis. So, for us, when you look at the dayparts, the daypart growth was strong, and was evenly distributed and contributed to the overall performance of the business. And Matt, do you want to take the MSR question?", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Sure. Just a reminder of what we did in the quarter. We started the quarter with 12 million actives and we went to 12.9 million as we exited. And, as you can imagine, we are continuing to accelerate.", "I think it's important to talk about where we were and where we are now. When we started the quarter at 12 million, we were behind where we wanted to be. And when we exited the quarter at 12.9 million, we were slightly ahead of where we wanted to be. So, we made up the gap and then some as we went through the quarter. This was a result of leaning in on two different fronts. To get to an active, you have to acquire and then you have to activate them. And we have done both in the quarter. So, we continue to lean in with acquisition, largely through our stores. And then importantly, because we know there are, as we said at Investor Day, millions of people who start the process, register but don't get all the way through to becoming active. We focused very strongly on that through digital communication, in app, and through other means with our customers. And because we're able to put those improvements to the digital flywheel in place, we were able to dramatically increase the number of actives as a result of activation.", "We continue to see promise in doing more. We have a lot of things in the pipeline to address that issue, and you're going to continue to see us lean in to acquire more members. So, we feel very good that there's a lot of upside out there. As you mentioned, there are 75 million customers and we only have 13 million or so right now. So, we see that as a great way of growing our business, because we know that every single time we acquire a new member, we see a large amount of incrementality on a customer-by-customer basis. And with the new Spend Rewards program in place, it's looking better and better.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim. Matthew, your line is now open.", "Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you so much. I had a question, just a follow-up. So, on the redeploying of labor, I think, it was mentioned, and adding some people also and adding some new stations as far as solving the bottleneck, I was curious, is that going to be something that we should maybe be a little bit \u2013 is that another level of investment maybe on the partnership line that is incremental to the margins in Americas in the coming quarters? Or is this a benign effect on the margins and it's going to be shifting labor?", "And then, just so I don't get cut off, my follow-up question was with respect to the guidance, the $0.44, $0.45, I guess, just to \u2013 you're not giving quarterly comps, but you're saying mid-single digit and they will get better in the back half. Is that then devoid of needing to do a mid-single digit in the second quarter, i.e., if you did a 2% comp you could still \u2013 the EPS is separated from that and you could still do the $0.44 to $0.45?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "I think Adam will take the first part, and I'll take the second.", "Adam B. Brotman - Starbucks Corp.", "Matthew, this is Adam. So, with regard to your first question, it is not about adding labor, per se. It's more about redeploying and aligning labor. So, it's something our stores do every day, by having these new tools in place, they can better work through the bottleneck at the handoff plane in a way that we know works. And at times, if it's necessary to add labor in a store, we do that for a number of reasons. This would just be one of them. And we always do that thoughtfully, surgically, and on an accretive basis. So, that's no different in this case, but now we have better tools and better processes to allow these, particularly these high volume Mobile Order & Pay stores to get after that quickly.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "And, Matt, what I would say on second quarter is I'd look back at the first quarter. We delivered a 3% comp and we met our guidance, and I would say over a quarter or a short period, we can continue to do that. Over the longer term, which includes the long-term guidance for this year, we need to get back up into the mid-single digits.", "Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles \u2013 sorry, Andrew Charles from Cowen. Andrew, your line is now open.", "Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC", "No worries, happens all the time. You talked at the Investor Day about 23% less attachment in mobile orders relative to traditional orders. So, I just wanted to talk about the check lift you've seen so far suggestive selling efforts have been implemented, and if this is meeting or exceeding your expectations.", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, we are just at the beginning right now, so we don't have any numbers to report at this point in time, but we're highly encouraged by what we're seeing, because for the first time in the context of Mobile Order & Pay, we have what our baristas normally do, which is to suggest something that's relevant to the customer at that point in time. Early indications are quite positive, but it literally is weeks old so we don't have any numbers that we wanted to share at this point.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "There's definitely reason for optimism. We've talked about this before. The total check on Mobile Order & Pay transactions is basically equal to other Starbucks Rewards transactions before suggestive selling. And when Matt and I set the business case, we expected it to be significantly below, because we thought attach would be soft until we could get into this capability, so I think it portends well for as we get suggestive selling going, given the fact that the ticket is almost equal, we think there's some upside there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Francfort from Bank of America. Greg, your line is now open.", "Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America", "Hey, guys and Howard, I have tremendous respect for you, and I know you'd appreciated the comments. Just my question, on the food comments that you've done with the 1% component to comp, I think it's been that way for three quarters now, and it had been running maybe a year ago, closer to 2 to 3 points. Is there an opportunity to get back there, and I guess does it have to come from gaining some traction at lunch? Or can breakfast sales reaccelerate? I guess, how do you get back to a larger component from the food comp?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, Greg, this is Kevin. I think consistent with, sort of, what we shared at Investor Day, the big opportunity for us to accelerate the contribution of food comp to their total comp is at lunch, and we continue to perform very well on the breakfast in the morning daypart with breakfast sandwiches in our bakery case, and the opportunity we see to reaccelerate comp contribution from food is at lunch. And I mentioned, we will \u2013 you will be seeing some new food items at lunch, and a new concept around a fresh, healthy culinary experience that we're going to be able to implement in our Starbucks stores in Chicago by this summer. And that is where we see the opportunity.", "Operator", "And that was our last question at this time. I now turn the call back over to Mr. Shaw.", "Thomas Shaw - Starbucks Corp.", "All right. Thanks again, everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter earnings call, which is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, April 27.

My name is Julie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.", "Mr. Shaw, you may begin your conference.", "Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.", "Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Tom Shaw, Vice President, Investor Relations at Starbucks Corporation. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2017 results, which will be led by Kevin Johnson, President and CEO; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; and Scott Maw, CFO. Joining us for Q&A are Howard Schultz, Executive Chairman; John Culver, Group President, Global Retail; Adam Brotman, EVP of Global Retail Ops; Kris Engskov, EVP, U.S. Operations; Belinda Wong, EVP and CEO, Starbucks China; and Tony Matta, President, Channel Development.", "This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.", "Please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release and on our website at investor.starbucks.com to find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. Also on our website, please note that we will be posting our updated financial targets following the conclusion of our prepared remarks on the call. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Johnson. Kevin?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, Tom, and welcome to everyone on today's call. I'm pleased to comment on the record financial and operating results that Starbucks reported today. In Q3, Starbucks grew revenues by 9%, excluding one point of foreign exchange, expanded non-GAAP operating margin by 100 basis points, and grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 14% over Q3 last year, excluding two points of FX. We also delivered 5% comp growth in the U.S., including a transaction splitting adjusted 1% increase in traffic, our strongest comp growth in the U.S. in five quarters. Another quarter of 7% comp growth in China, largely attributed to increased traffic, and 4% comp growth globally. Noteworthy is that in addition to delivering record financial and operating performance in Q3, both our retail and CPG segments also gained meaningful increases in U.S. market share, despite the softness in both sectors.", "You will recall that our revenue growth in the first half of fiscal 2017 was roughly 6.5%, and our U.S. comp growth was about 3%. So, our Q3 performance reflects the back-half acceleration we've anticipated. I'm particularly pleased that our Q3 results were delivered in the face of today's rapidly unfolding retail industry disruption. Yet despite record industry-leading performance through three quarters of fiscal 2017 and a robust pipeline of food and beverage and digital innovation coming in Q4 and the quarters ahead, today's challenging retail and consumer environments, compounded by headwinds related to the retail disruption underway has us taking the slightly more cautious view as we enter Q4.", "On today's call, we will discuss the drivers of our Q3 performance and update you on the progress we've made against our operational priorities, including an update from Matt Ryan, our Chief Strategy Officer, on the ground-breaking new digital capabilities that we've contributed to our comp, revenue, and profit acceleration. We will explain how each of the strategic actions we announced today will further align Starbucks company-operated and licensed markets for maximum growth and shareholder value creation, and results in the exiting of certain non-core or slow-growth operations and assets. And we will demonstrate how together, these actions will support our growth strategy by strengthening our core, sharpening our focus, and increasing our efficiency. Then Scott will speak to the financial implications of these actions. He'll take you through our Q3 financial and operating results in detail and provide an update on Q4 guidance. Then we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Now, to set the backdrop for today's call, I refer the comments I made last quarter regarding the two critical, transformative elements required for any brick-and-mortar retailer to survive, let alone succeed in the future: an emerging digital and mobile relationship with customers that is threaded into a branded and immersive experiential retail destination. Retailers who are agile and reimagine the art of the possible will be big industry winners. Those who do not will struggle mightily. The evidence is clear that the pace of retail transformation is accelerating with a common theme: extending the in-store experiences to include relevant digital scenarios. It is the driving force behind combinations including Walmart's acquisition of Jet.com, the combination of PetSmart and Chewy.com, and last month's announcement of Amazon's intent to acquire Whole Foods. Each of these combinations demonstrate that pursuit of enhancing the physical retail experience with a relevant and complementary digital experience.", "Starbucks identified the coming seismic shift in retail years before it consumed the industry. And we are well positioned because we invested ahead of the curve to extend our global leadership around all things premium coffee and tea, developed world-leading digital and mobile capabilities linked to loyalty, create experiential third-place environments, and deep authentic connections among our customers, our partners, and the communities we serve, providing an increasingly elevated and engaging Starbucks Experience. Successful execution around each of these initiatives is why, despite the powerful retail headwinds and cross-currents underway, Starbucks continues to produce record financial and operating results quarter after quarter, and open a new class of over 2,000 stores around the world every year that continue to outperform competitors and deliver industry-leading AUVs and profit, starting virtually from the day they open their doors.", "Now, let me just pause here a moment and interject a thought. At the same time as we continue to internally extend and expand our own digital capabilities, we will also continue to explore commercial partnerships with third-party digital companies. Now, these partnerships, we believe, will enable us to leverage our brand, our global retail footprint, and the customer base in order to extend our reach, including into payments, loyalty and social gifting among others, just as we are doing with great success in China with Tencent.", "Now, with almost 27,000 stores in 75 countries serving roughly 90 million customer visits each week, no traditional brick-and-mortar retailer is better positioned to navigate and flourish in the global retail industry of today or better positioned to lead in the digital retail world of tomorrow. And we will do so with speed, agility, and a focus on creating long-term shareholder value.", "The strategic actions we announced today are fully aligned with the long-term strategy we communicated at Investor Day last December, and they will enable us to focus on the fastest growing, highest return aspects of our growth agenda. We have clear principles that guide us in determining which markets are best served as company-operated versus licensed markets. Adherence to these principles prompted us to transition the German market to long-time license partner AmRest in 2016 and to sell our 50% interest in our Taiwan JV to long-term partner Uni-President Group in a transaction we announced today.", "At the same time, we will not shy away from expanding our presence in markets that evidence strong growth opportunities at scale. We entered China almost 18 years ago, and today recognized as among the most respected brands in that country; along the way, establishing relationships, relationships with millions of customers, tens of thousands of partners, and a meaningful presence in 130 communities. Starbucks' opportunity for growth in China is unparalleled and our purchase of the remaining 50% of our East China JV is a significant milestone, reflecting our long-term commitment to China and our unwavering optimism about our future in that key long-term growth market. And we are just getting started.", "We also made a significant announcement related to our growing tea business. Tea is a large fast-growing category and a key addressable market and core focus for us. Since acquiring Teavana, we have built the business into a well-recognized, super-premium global brand. We expect to sell over $1.6 billion of Teavana branded, handcrafted beverages through Starbucks stores around the world this year. Overall, our tea business has grown 40% since we launched Teavana in the U.S. five years ago, and it is up over 60% since launching in China and Japan roughly one year ago.", "Innovation is key, and we continue to innovate around tea, just this month introducing Teavana Infusions, a flavor platform made from real fruits and botanicals that strengthens our lineup of healthy, less indulgent, premium cold beverages. Through our partnership with Anheuser-Busch, we've extended the Teavana brand into a ready-to-drink platform that will create even greater brand awareness and fuel further growth.", "We have big plans for tea in Starbucks retail and CPG globally, but as we shared with you on our last call, many of our Teavana mall-based stores have been persistently underperforming. We conducted a strategic review of the Teavana mall-based store business and concluded that despite our efforts to reverse the trend through creative merchandising and new store designs, the underperformance was likely to continue. As a result, we will be closing all 379 of our Teavana mall stores over the coming year. Scott will speak to the financial implications of this decision shortly. Each of the actions I just described is a powerful driver of value creation that will strengthen our business and enable us to focus our resources on priorities that drive outsized current returns and long-term shareholder value, supporting our strategy and sustaining profitable growth into the future.", "On our last call, I outlined five operational priorities: continuing to accelerate comp sales and transaction growth in the U.S., driving breakthroughs in food for the lunch day-part, enabling long-term growth in China, extending our digital flywheel assets, elevating through our Roasteries and the Starbucks Reserve brand. Today, I'm adding a sixth: gaining share of at-home coffee down the aisle, a subject Scott will address shortly.", "Now, let me comment briefly on a few of these priorities. On our last call, I outlined a broad set of initiatives focused on accelerating U.S. comp sales. We are very pleased with the progress we've made to increase throughput in our stores in the face of rapidly increasing customer usage of Mobile Order & Pay. We are unlocking incremental growth potential across all dayparts, particularly at peak, while at the same time improving the Starbucks Experience for all customers. Food plays an important role in our growth agenda, contributing 21% of our U.S. revenue in Q3. We remain focused on driving breakthroughs in food for lunch, as we create new offerings in a relevant daypart and greater choice for our customers. These objectives were behind our decision to up-level our lunch menu lineup with Mercato, our fresh food concept. Mercato is exceeding expectations in its Chicago launch market and we're moving up the launch of Mercato in the Seattle market to August.", "We are extremely excited about our strategy and the opportunity to further enable long-term growth in China. Our business has never been stronger or more robust, with revenues that consistently increase over 20% annually, driving significant margin and profit growth. We continue to open roughly 500 new stores in China every year at a rate of new store growth that will accelerate over time. Our newest class of stores continue to outperform and deliver record AUVs, now nearly 700,000 per unit, and world-leading returns. In fact, given our performance and success in China and the momentum we are seeing across the country in both retail and CPG channels, we now see the opportunity for Starbucks in China being even greater than we originally thought. We are committed to a long-term growth agenda in China, executed in a respectful fashion that instills pride in our Starbucks partners and deepens our connection to our customers and the communities we serve.", "The data are clear that our beautiful stores, engaging store partners, new beverage, food, and digital innovations, and our focus on operational excellence are attracting new customers into our stores in China and bringing existing customers in more often. And with the transition of East China to a company-operated model, we will meaningfully advance our China agenda by enabling our strong, local leadership team to fully leverage our infrastructure and scale economics in order to maximize the growth opportunities ahead.", "And, I'm pleased to report that already 90% of our eligible China partners are taking advantage of the fully sponsored critical illness insurance for their parents, a breakthrough partner benefit we introduced in Q3. We will continue to invest in our people and are committed to remaining one of the most admired brands and an employer of choice in China. And with the opening of our Shanghai Roastery in December, we will further elevate the Starbucks brand and introduce our customers in China, as well as visitors from all across Asia, to the immersive, ultra-premium coffee-forward Starbucks Roastery experience.", "Now, our digital flywheel is a powerful proprietary asset that is driving deep customer engagement, revenue, and profit growth around the world. And we're pleased with the contributions that our digital flywheel made to our business in Q3. Given the significance of the digital initiatives underway, I've asked Matt Ryan to provide you with an overview of the Q3 contribution and share some thoughts with you on the future of digital. Matt?", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, Kevin. Digital relationships are becoming increasingly important to Starbucks' growth, contributing both the majority of U.S. comp growth in Q3 and to our continued outperformance compared to our sector. U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership rose to 13.3 million active customers in Q3, up over 8% from last year and up 28% from two years ago. We have seen spend per member rise to record levels, up 8% over Q3 last year. Between new member acquisition and increases in spend per member, 36% of our U.S. revenues came from Starbucks Rewards members in Q3, driving the 41% of our revenues that are prepaid on our own proprietary payment platform, reflecting rapidly increasing customer adoption of our digital platforms.", "At Investor Day in December, we identified our digital flywheel's four key drivers of incrementality: customer acquisition, spend-based rewards, personalized offers, and convenient ordering. The data are clear that when we acquire a new customer, the act of signing up for a digital relationship results in a sudden and sustained lift in spend, as measured by careful pre/post tracking. That's how we're able to drive so much value from a relatively small portion of customers, 13 3 million active reward customers compared to a total of approximately 75 million unique customer visits to our stores each month. We know that even modest increases in the total universe of active customers drive tremendous long-term value and we have detailed plans in place to significantly expand our universe of digitally engaged customers and drive strong, sustainable, profitable growth into the future.", "Second, Starbucks Rewards are highly motivating and the conversion to a spend-based program has resulted in a clear lift in member spend. Third, personalization, in which we target specific messages and offers to individual customers based upon their history with us, has proven highly effective, as evidenced by test and control measurements in spend per member. Fourth, mobile ordering remained highly incremental, resulting in many more occasions per customer than would be the case otherwise because the convenience encourages more on-the-go visits.", "Last year, we deployed new personalization technology and a new front-end experience in our app, investments that have contributed to the measurable success in digital we are experiencing. Today, we are enabling a new generation of digital innovation that will begin rolling out in waves starting this fall. This fundamental modernization of our technology stack will replace legacy rewards and ordering functionality with the new scalable cloud-based platform for rewards and ordering, improved customer data organization, and tighter integration with store-based operating systems, including inventory and production management.", "The first phase of the platform rollout will enable us to flexibly change and configure rewards programs and become more nimble in creating new benefits for customers. It will enable new features and extend and expand the program by creating the ability to award exclusive benefits to subsets of our customers. For example, to customers who sign up for the new co-branded payment products we will be launching in the U.S. with Chase. The first application of the new technology will support the rollout of Starbucks Rewards in Japan this fall, with other markets following thereafter.", "The second phase of the platform rollout will include new ordering functionality. We will still require stored value accounts for customers to receive stars with every purchase, but we'll no longer require customers to use a stored value account to place an order, removing a barrier to expanding usage of Mobile Order & Pay, a service that is highly incremental to our business.", "This will result in digital relationships with a new pool of customers who have Starbucks accounts and payment credentials on file, expanding the universe of customers we can target with offers and communications driven by our personalization engine. As a first step, we'll be testing a guest checkout feature for first-time users of the app early in 2018.", "Over time, our new technology platform will also flexibly interface with inventory and point-of-sale systems in our company-owned stores and inventory and point of sale systems owned by our licensed partners. This new foundational technology will also enable even more convenient ways for customers to order their beverages and food, providing even more reasons for customers to set up digital relationships with us.", "In addition to our long-term digital technology roadmap, we continue to innovate in the short term around our newer technology platforms. We are expanding personalization by offering new offer constructs, real-time triggers and push notifications to engage customers more deeply, building on the momentum that is generating the higher spend per member. We've also committed to increase registration into the program, taking advantage of the seasonal momentum that begins after the summer season. We are removing friction in the sign-up process, improving the digital interface and registration flow, and are in the early days of testing solutions that greatly streamline sign-up.", "We're also seeing results from our efforts at personalization that far exceed our own high expectations and recognize the value extending personalization to non-Rewards customers. Our marketing teams are now building the universe of customers that opt into direct communications from us. In the future, you'll hear more about our efforts to grow not just Starbucks Rewards, but the total number of people who engage with us digitally in any fashion, as our personalization engine will help us deepen engagement with customers beyond our core loyalty customers.", "New ordering capabilities also means transforming our store operations, and as part of the next generation of technology in our stores, we're adding the Digital Order Manager, or DOM, now present in roughly 1,000 of our busiest Mobile Order & Pay stores. We are also making improvements to our inventory management technology, and in the future, we'll be adding capabilities to enhance customer service, including introducing tools that enable baristas to recognize customers that deserve differentiated treatment, perhaps customers celebrating birthdays or regular customers from one store who show up at a different store.", "Building digital relationships takes time and focus. We see ourselves as pioneers and leaders in building digital relationships with customers and have a proven track record of success that is unrivaled in retail. At the same time, we recognize that digital companies are trying to get into traditional retail businesses, like grocery. In our business, where the scale of our physical footprint, our customers' relationships with our partners, and the third-place experience we deliver are so critical, we have an inherent advantage that digital companies will struggle to replicate.", "We're not complacent and recognize that digital relationships will increasingly be the key drivers of demand generation, even in physical stores. By leading in the combination of physical and digital, we not only drive superior business results in the short term, based on rewards, ordering, and personalization, but we also make it very challenging for digital companies to outmaneuver us in the physical world. While digital companies may win in other sectors, we will be the digital company that wins in ours. The current digital trajectory we have demonstrated is proof that we are winning today and will continue to extend our lead into the future. Kevin?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, Matt. In addition to our digital agenda, we're also investing to elevate both our brand and our customer experience around coffee through our Roasteries and the Starbucks Reserve brand. Starbucks Roasteries are at the center of our innovation strategy around branded experiential retail customer destinations. Complementing our first Roastery in Seattle are additional Roasteries now under construction in Shanghai, New York, Milan, and Tokyo, and under development in Chicago. Our Roasteries will ultimately be complemented by Reserve bars in thousands of Starbucks locations and several hundred new Starbucks Reserve stores around the world. Roasteries and Reserve stores will delight our customers with delicious food offerings through our partnership with Italian artisanal baker, Princi.", "In Q3, we continued to solidify and extend our brand and market positions and our global leadership around all things coffee and tea. While our investment in Roasteries and Reserve stores enables a world-class, ultra-premium, coffee-forward experience in flagship locations around the globe, it also establishes a core innovation center second to none that will continue to fuel innovation across the Starbucks platform.", "The ongoing disruption and transformation of the retail industry is accelerating, with very few winners. With another quarter of solid global growth and record financial performance, Starbucks is a clear winner. And we will continue to win by playing the long game, all around the world. The strategic actions we announced today were developed and pressure-tested against the requirements that they strengthen our core, enable profitable growth, reduce costs and complexity, and facilitate a more tactical deployment of our capital and resources to areas where they will generate the highest returns. Each will achieve those objectives, and by doing so, contribute to our ability to continue delivering industry-leading increases in revenue and profits, and outsized returns to our shareholders.", "I'll now turn the call over to Scott for a deep dive into our operating performance and financial results in Q3. Scott?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks once again reported record operating and financial performance in Q3, reflecting the back-half acceleration we've been anticipating. Nonetheless, as Kevin shared, despite posting record performance in Q3 and further extending our lead compared to the industry overall, the combination of trends in the quarter and ongoing macro pressures impacting the retail and restaurant sectors overall, has us a bit more cautious going into Q4. On today's call, I'll cover three topics. First, I will provide an overview of our Q3 operating and financial performance. Next, I'll provide additional context around the strategies under way to sharpen our focus and enable accelerated growth and further increases in return on capital, and finally, I will provide guidance for Q4. We will be providing our initial growth targets for fiscal 2018 on next quarter's earnings call, just as we did coming into this year.", "GAAP operating income was $1 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.2 billion, up 15% including one point of negative FX. Operating margin totaled 18.4% on a GAAP basis and 20.8% on a non-GAAP basis, up 100 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales leverage partially offset by increased partner investments in the Americas. GAAP EPS was $0.47, inclusive of impairment charges primarily related to the closure of our principally mall-based Teavana stores, a development I will discuss shortly. Excluding these and other charges, non-GAAP EPS grew 12% to $0.55 in Q3 including two points of negative impact from FX.", "I'll now take you through our Q3 operating performance by segment. Americas revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $4 billion in Q3, primarily driven by 1,002 net new store openings over the past 12 months, and 5% comp growth, this segment's strongest comp performance in five quarters. Excluding the impact of order consolidation following last year's transition to the new Rewards program, America's segment transaction comp was a positive 1% in Q3. We expect Q3 of fiscal 2017 to be the last quarter reflecting any meaningful impact from order consolidation.", "While we are pleased that our Americas segment delivered top-line improvement in a difficult retail and consumer environment, we did experience a softening in transaction comps as we moved through the quarter. Momentum entering the quarter, beginning with April's wildly successful introduction of the Unicorn Frappuccino was strong, but comp trends softened in the back half of the quarter, and this softness has continued into July. The slowdown included a lower than expected lift in non-discounted Frappuccino beverages following Happy Hour, as well as somewhat lower than expected sales of other core beverages during the period. Lunch was our fastest growing daypart, driven by increased customer adoption of our food lineup and better-for-you beverage options.", "Peak showed sequential quarter improvement, albeit somewhat less than we had forecast, and the afternoon was pressured across several core beverage categories. Reversing this trend and increasing transactions in the U.S. remains a key priority for us and we have several initiatives supporting this priority underway, including strengthening and leverage our digital and marketing capabilities, driving food and beverage innovation, and further improving our operations and in-store execution.", "Matt covered digital innovation, so I'll take food and beverage innovation and our progress on improving throughput. As we move through summer, we have a full pipeline of food and beverage innovation, including hot and cold, better for you and indulgent offerings for all dayparts. On the beverage side, our recently introduced Teavana Shaken Iced Tea Infusions, an innovative approach to delivering robust flavor in a healthy way by combining our core iced teas with the unique, freshly-steeped blends of fruits and botanicals is performing very well. So, too, are our new Iced Cascara Coconutmilk Latte and returning favorite Iced Coconutmilk Mocha Macchiato.", "And within food, we have expanded our lineup of protein-forward offerings with improved Bistro Boxes and the introduction of a seared steak and egg wrap and two new varieties of lunch bowls. Clearly, our commitment to food innovation is delivering, as evidenced by the two points of comp growth from food we reported again this quarter.", "Let's now turn to our throughput initiatives. You will recall that our throughput improvement is slated to come in three waves. So first, targeted improvements in labor, resulted in our introducing dedicated Mobile Order & Pay rolls during certain hours in our busiest stores and has already contributed to both improved throughput at peak and improved customer service scores. Noteworthy is that our highest volume MOP stores experienced the greatest increases in customer experience scores this quarter.", "Second wave initiatives include deployment of the Digital Order Manager, a high-value, low-cost technology that is both further increasing throughput and providing us with an extremely valuable source of new data to further optimize store operations and further elevate our customer experience. The DOM contributes to an improved MOP customer experience by providing mobile notifications to customers when their order is ready and facilitating a smoother experience at the handoff point. And it improves the MOP partner experience by replacing the paper-based ticket consolidation process with a modern touch screen order consolidation tool.", "Additional wave two actions include further carefully targeted investments in labor and the introduction of a new approach to beverage production and deployment that we call channel production. By creating distinct production channels utilizing current equipment and labor allocations, this new order production and deployment capability is enabling a throughput unlock in the stores where we are testing the approach. Our third wave enhancements begin rolling in October 2017 and include improved spacing and production capacity in all new and remodeled stores, new production sequencing software, and an enhanced labor scheduling platform.", "In Q3, Americas operating income grew 8% and operating margin was roughly flat compared to last year. Increased investments in our U.S. store partners remained a headwind, though the Q3 impact was more muted than in prior quarters as the business lapped a significant one-time bonus paid to partners last year. In addition, the mix shift resulting from lower beverage comps combined with strong food sales put some additional pressure on gross margins again this quarter. Of our 5% U.S. comp growth in Q3, three points were driven by beverage with continued strong sales of iced beverages, including iced coffee growing 33% year-over-year, and Refreshers, including the highly successful Pink Drink, growing 57%. And for the second consecutive quarter, food delivered two points of comp, driven entirely by attach.", "Let's move on to China/Asia-Pacific. Starbucks China/Asia-Pacific region delivered another quarter of strong performance with year-over-year revenue and operating income growth of 9% and 22%, respectively. CAP revenue of $841 million was driven largely by net new stores and comp growth of 1%, driven by an acceleration in China comps to 7%, offset by softness in Japan. As we have previously noted, CAP comps are currently more heavily weighted towards Japan, where revenue, profitability, and new store performance remained very strong. Noteworthy is that over the nearly three years since we acquired the market in Japan, it's been delivering an average of 3% quarterly comp growth, profitable new store growth, and that has accelerated, and total revenue and profit growth in Japan are running in line with our initial deal assumptions.", "CAP has now reported five consecutive years of double-digit revenue and operating income growth through Q3. CAP's operating margin expanded 280 basis points to 26.6% on a GAAP basis and 270 basis points to 28.3% on a non-GAAP basis. Contributing to CAP's Q3 margin expansion was the final impact from the now fully-lapped transition to a value-added tax structure in China and a nearly 30% increase in income from our joint venture operations, including South Korea and East China.", "Turning to EMEA. Our EMEA segment delivered solid results, and at 2%, its strongest comp growth in seven quarters. In Q3, led by strong performance in the U.K. System comps in the region were even higher, increasing 5% and once again validating our decision to move certain EMEA markets to a licensed model. Revenues in EMEA totaled $250 million in Q3, a 9% decline versus prior year. However, when normalized for a 16% impact of portfolio shifts and FX, EMEA revenue actually grew 7%, driven by incremental revenues from over 311 net new stores added in the last 12 months. EMEA's GAAP operating margin totaled 4% with non-GAAP operating margin at 11% after adjusting for the impact of goodwill impairment in Switzerland, roughly flat to Q3 last year, despite 130 basis points impact from FX. We will continue to focus on improving operations and shifting the mix towards licensed stores in EMEA, efforts that have contributed to EMEA delivering solid mid-single digit system sales growth and double-digit non-GAAP operating margins for 12 consecutive quarters.", "Turning to Channel Development, Channel Development had a very solid Q3, delivering strong revenue growth of 9%. Starbucks K-Cup sales increased 10% in the quarter compared to 0.5% growth for the K-Cup category overall, driving our share of the K-Cup category up 1.4% to 16.6% overall and our roast and ground sales grew 8% in the quarter compared to 0.4% growth in roast and ground overall, resulting in a 1% category share gain to 13%. We will continue to focus on profitably growing share of both K-Cup and roast and ground, but expect somewhat lower top and bottom line growth in Q4 as deceleration in the categories overall has invited increased competition and discounting.", "Tea is a core focus of ours and, as Kevin mentioned, we're having great success with Teavana in both Starbucks retail stores and grocery. We have already shipped over 2.5 million bottles of Teavana ready-to-drink teas in just five months with all four flavors already ranking in the top ten in the premium single-serve RTD tea category in our active markets. And we plan to launch Teavana branded packaged tea in grocery channels by the end of the fiscal 2018. Channel Development's operating income grew 12% in Q3 and the segment delivered 130-basis-point improvement in operating margin to 43.9%, driven principally by lower coffee costs and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership with Pepsi.", "Let's now shift to the strategic actions we announced today. Despite our size and scale, Starbucks remains very much a growth company. The opportunities that exist for us globally are significant and we are doubling down on our investments in key profitable growth areas, including Mainland China and digital, to further accelerate growth in the years ahead. This shift in capital deployment towards more profitable, higher returning assets will result in increased focus and be accretive to returns going forward. You could hear of additional actions as we move towards and into fiscal 2018, but let's start with details around the actions we announced today, beginning with tea.", "As Kevin mentioned, today, we announced the decision to close all of our Teavana stores. As a result of this decision, we took an asset impairment and goodwill charges of approximately $100 million in Q3. The charges are specifically called out in a separate line item on our income statement where we will also include various charges related to streamlining our operations over the coming quarters. Closure of the Teavana stores will occur over the next several quarters and additional related charges are likely to be incurred over the same periods. While resulting in near-term costs, removing the ongoing operating loss and associated overhead will result in a fairly rapid payback of our exit costs.", "We're also extremely excited about expanding our ownership of the Mainland China market. Funding for the estimated $1.3 billion purchase of our JV partner's remaining stake in Mainland China will come from existing offshore cash and result in no additional debt. Excluding the substantial gain we will recognize on the acquisition, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other acquisition related expenses, we expect the transaction to be break-even to slightly accretive in the first year. We expect accretion to build over time, as we integrate the acquired operations into our existing Mainland China business.", "The acquisition will add approximately $1 billion in revenue in the first year following closing. The final sales price will not be determined until our fiscal Q2 of 2018. We will provide further detail around the financial impact of this transaction when we report our Q1 FY 2018 results in January and will likely schedule a separate modeling call related to the acquisition as we did in connection with the Japan transaction in 2014.", "Clearly with this acquisition, we are entering a new phase of our growth strategy in CAP and we look forward to sharing additional details about the opportunity and our progress in CAP in the quarters ahead. At the same time as we are consolidating our position in Mainland China, we are shifting our 50% JV ownership in Taiwan to a fully licensed structure in exchange for approximately $175 million. This represents the largest licensing transaction in our history and is in complete alignment with our strategy to license in markets that we have growth potential, but where returns are better served by a partner with deep local expertise.", "So, let's move on to 2017 targets. We said consistently that the back half of the year would show improvement compared to the front half. That continues to be our expectation, but we now expect results a bit lower than our previous guidance, given the choppiness we saw in Q3 and are seeing in early Q4. Specifically, we now expect revenue growth to come in at the low end of our previous guidance range of 8% to 10%, excluding one point of FX and two points of impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2016. We are also projecting global comp growth for Q4 at 3% to 4%. As a result, our EPS guidance is revised as follows: full-year GAAP EPS in the range of $1.96 to $1.97 and full year non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.05 to $2.06, representing an EPS growth range of 12% to 13%, excluding one to two points of FX. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS will be in the range of $0.53 to $0.54 and non-GAAP EPS will be in the range of $0.54 to $0.55.", "We continue to expect non-GAAP consolidating operating margins to show slight improvement compared to FY 2016 on a 52-week basis. For segment operating margins in FY 2017, we expect Americas operating margin to be moderately lower than last year, CAP operating margins to show strong expansion, EMEA operating margins to be roughly flat to 2016, excluding FX, and Channel Development to post strong operating margin improvement for the year with Q4 margins roughly flat year-over-year. Looking at commodities and FX, our coffee needs are locked for fiscal 2017 and we expect commodities to be slightly favorable for the year. We are also 70% price-locked for fiscal 2018, at coffee prices roughly comparable to 2017.", "As we've discussed our goal is to grow G&A at the core at half the rate of revenue growth and we are on track to achieve this goal for the year. Specifically, G&A as recorded year-to-date fiscal 2017 was up 5%, up 10% from last year after adjusting for current and prior year anomalies of approximately five points. Core G&A, which comprises over 80% of the total, was roughly half of the 10% increase with innovation G&A comprising the other half. We remain committed to managing our core G&A growth rate while investing for the near- and long-term and, as Kevin mentioned, renewed focus on our core business will positively impact our ability to keep G&A at or below the current target.", "We have significantly increased our capital returns to shareholders over the past five years with buybacks up from roughly zero in 2009 to $1.2 billion this year to date in 2017. Going forward, we will continue to accelerate cash return to shareholders, and as we announced in Investor Day, to increase our dividend payout range to 40% to 50%. We now expect to open 2,200 net new stores globally in 2017. This reflects an increase of 100 net new stores for the Americas to 900 net new stores for the year. All other targets for FY 2017 remain the same.", "At the time of our last earnings call, we were seeing significant positive momentum in our principal global retail markets, particularly the U.S. However, that momentum ebbed and flowed over the quarter. The actions we have put in place are beginning to gain traction, but stiff consumer and industry headwinds remain. So, while lowering current year guidance as we enter Q4 is difficult, given the uncertainty we are seeing in the marketplace, we feel that doing so is the better part of valor and the appropriate action to take. At the same time, we know that each of the strategic actions we announced today will strengthen our core and be accretive to future returns.", "Consistent with past practice, we will provide 2018 targets on our Q4 call. This allows us to complete our annual planning process and have further clarity around critical investments in 2018 and more granularity around the timing and impacts of the strategic actions we announced today. Given all of this, we will also discuss any revisions to our long-range targets on the Q4 call. Despite our size and scale, Starbucks' financial aspirations remain unchanged, to be a best-in-class growth retailer at scale. As always, credit for our success today and tomorrow belongs to our 330,000 passionate Starbucks partners around the world who deliver an authentic Starbucks Experience roughly 90 million times around the world each week. Our partners have our great respect and appreciation.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi, thank you. The question is just broadly on the Americas business. Your comps aren't quite what you hoped they were going to be, very well documented consumer and industry issues, yet 900 net new stores in the Americas, which is a big addition. You could potentially put pressure on comps, which is what I'd like you to talk about and also difficulty in attracting or retaining labor this far into an economic cycle. So, the question is really two different things. Does it make sense to begin to think about whether that 900 net new stores in the Americas should hit a plateau or even come down over time, given challenges that may even worsen in the out years? And then secondly, if you can update us in terms of your practices of attracting and retaining partners, at this point, both for existing and new stores.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Thanks, John, it's Scott. I'll take the first part and then I might have John Culver help me a bit with the second. The first thing I would say is our portfolio growth rate in the U.S. has stayed pretty constant over the last few years, so while the number of stores have come up, the percentage of portfolio growth has stayed pretty stable. And we're able to track quite accurately the cannibalization results that happened from those new stores, and what we've seen over many years is very, very little impact of net new cannibalization of those new stores. And I attribute that to a significant improvement in the analytics under Matt Ryan's team of where we place stores, the trade areas we place stores in, the type of stores that we're putting in those trade areas, and so we continue to see that kind of very, very small cannibalization and extensive store growth opportunities. And the only other thing I'll say before I hand it to John is remember that that 900 is split roughly evenly between company-owned stores and licensed stores, and those licensed stores are unique opportunities for us to get access to real estate.", "John, do you want to talk about labor?", "John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, just real quick. One thing I would just add on the new stores and the performance, clearly, we believe that there's still a long runway for growth for new stores in the U.S. And there's a lot of opportunity to continue to infill. We are seeing strong performance, not only in our core stores in the new stores, but then also through drive-through. And we're going to continue to focus in this area. We have not seen cannibalization, as Scott highlighted, and we believe in the growth strategy we have in place. It's been 13 consecutive quarters that our new and non-comp stores have contributed at least 4% to our growth on a quarter-to-quarter basis, so I feel good about the trajectory that we're on.", "In terms of partner retention, obviously we continue to make investments in our people, both in terms of wage and in terms of benefits. We continue to see retention increase. In the most recent quarter, our retention sequentially increased versus the previous quarter as well as versus last year's same quarter.", "We feel good about the partner engagement that we have in our stores. When you look at how we measure partner engagement, those scores on a year-over-year basis exceeded last year. So, we feel good about the engagement that we're having from our partners, and then more importantly, how that translates into the customer experience. And we all know that our partners bring the experience to life for our customers, and, as part of that high level of engagement that they have, our customer experience scores are sitting at record highs right now, so we feel good about what we're seeing there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Your line is now open.", "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi, good afternoon. I have another question on the Americas business. I guess, as we think about the trends you saw through the quarter softening after April, there's been a lot of talk on the call about sort of macro issues. I was just wondering how you determine that this is more of a macro issue and not a company-specific issue. And perhaps could you comment on whether you think April was just inflated by the Frappuccino launch, and maybe when you take that out, maybe the trend has been a little bit more stable or do you actually see a deceleration in the overall business? Thanks.", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Thanks, David. Matt Ryan here. And I want to get to the short-term question. Well, let me frame first with a little bit of a long-term view here, which is that in the U.S. and just about any other market we've studied, there's been a decades-long trend for growth away from home, food and beverage consumption, driven by demographics and people just want more convenience. And we're strongly bullish on the long-term continuation of that trend.", "However, in the past year, we've seen some pullback from that trendline, as we have from time to time, with consumers in the U.S. shifting some discretionary spend to other categories. We look at all sorts of sources of data here, including corroborating credit and debit card spend data. But we think the best source of industry comp intelligence comes from the APT index, which is a metric developed by Applied Predictive Technologies, that's the name of the company, that aggregates and tracks actual comp data from a broad set of more than 100,000 retail restaurant and QSR competitor locations on a weekly basis, allowing us to understand just how well we're doing versus important benchmarks.", "And for Q3 overall, the APT index showed decelerating and negative comp for QSR and restaurant industries, while Starbucks' own metrics accelerated comp to 5%. In fact, the differential between Starbucks and the industry increased significantly in Q3 compared to the past several quarters, and that's just on the comp stores. It excludes the effect of any further market share gains we have as a result of our strong pace of new store openings.", "Within the quarter, we did see some deceleration in month-to-month comp performance for both industry benchmarks and Starbucks, but Starbucks steadily outpaced the competition. And I'll let someone else (51:56) comment on that as well.", "What we really think this is about is the strong performance in share capture having to do with the pipeline of product innovation, the continued improvements to store operations that you heard about, and growth in digital engagement. And it's the trifecta of these three things: product innovations, ops excellence and digital, will continue to support market share capture in the short term. And should the current pullback in industry performance go back to the long-term trend, as we think it will, it will help align us and set us up for success there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Yes, thank you very much. I'd like to also just ask a few questions about the comp drivers going forward. On the core coffee, it sounds like it's been a bit softer for the last couple quarters. So, I'm just trying to understand what might be driving that. We know some of the QSRs have gone aggressively against coffee beverages and I was wondering if it might be competitive in nature. And then food, by contrast, is doing quite well. So, as we think about that going forward, is this largely going to be a kind of a ticket-driven comp with attach driving that food? And how do we think about food offsetting the core coffee? Thanks.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah. Sarah, this is Kevin. I'll comment and then hand to John Culver. In our U.S. business, 2 points of our comps came from our core beverages, and that's across all dayparts. So, certainly, our core coffee and espresso and core beverages contributed 2 points of comp. Food contributed 2 points of comp and then innovation beverages contributed the other 1 point. So, there's 3 points of comp from beverage, 2 points from food. And that just highlights why it's important for us to continue to drive innovation, both in food and in beverage.", "So, when you think about the innovation on beverage side, we've got a number of new things we've been doing around both hot and cold. You take some of the iced espresso beverages that we've been launching and bringing to market, Iced Macchiato is an example, continued innovation and deployment of Nitro into more stores for Nitro Cold Brew, very popular. Certainly, this quarter, the Teavana Infusions is an example of that. And then in the last quarter the Refreshers; kind of evolved around the Pink Drink as an example, but the Refreshers also helped. So, we've seen good comp growth from not only our core beverages, but also the innovation that we've been doing around other beverages as well as food. John, I'll let you add other comments if you have any.", "John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, just to add a few things to what Kevin expressed. First off, we're very pleased with the success food is having in our stores and the continued attach rate. And we talked about the success across all dayparts and the growth that we saw in the quarter across all dayparts. Lunch was the fastest growing daypart and it was driven by food attach, as well as our refreshment and iced beverages. And when you break down that beverage growth for the total quarter, we saw good growth in espresso, core espresso. We saw growth in brewed and we did see growth in blended as well as refreshment, all right?", "And to put a finer point on that, a couple of highlights there. First was Iced Coffee and Cold Brew. We actually grew Iced Coffee and Cold Brew 33% in the quarter. In addition, we also grew iced espresso, a core beverage, plus 27% in the quarter. And then refreshment, driven by Pink Drink, grew 57% in the quarter. So, we're seeing strong growth as it relates to core, as well as refreshment and in iced drinks.", "From a food standpoint, we saw innovation come into the quarter with the new protein boxes and the enhancements that they brought and the additional attach that they drove at lunch. We also saw growth in our core bakery and breakfast egg sandwiches in the morning daypart, which was great. And then we continue to see great success with the Sous Vide Egg Bites and we have plans to have that available nationally in the early part of August, which we're excited about.", "So, we feel good about the mix. Clearly, we want to continue to focus on transactions, and transactions is all about making sure that we're building those customer connections and that we are operating our stores at the level we expect and that our customers have come to expect.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much. Just following up on the U.S. trends that you talked about kind of post-April, I'm just wondering whether you \u2013 as you read the data, whether you see a noticeable change in the actual consumer behavior, or perhaps the way they're using Starbucks products. Just wondering, kind of as you tie that in with maybe promotional activity, it seems like the industry is aggressive. I was just wondering whether you'd characterize Starbucks as being aggressive or what type of offers are more successful. Fearful that maybe people are getting too aggressive with the promotions where you can actually turn off customers, especially with the one-on-one offers. So, anything related to change in usage patterns and the aggressive nature in terms of your promotional activity.", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, thanks, Jeffrey, it's Scott. What I would say is there was no real impact other than the normal positive lift we saw all quarter around Starbucks Rewards. So we're not seeing any fatigue at all on the offers or in personalization. If anything, as Matt discussed, that's accelerating.", "What I would say, and I think this is what John was talking about, we did see some softness in the afternoon. It grew, it just grew a little bit less than we had expected and that was partly Frappuccino, but not only Frappuccino. We saw some softness in some of our iced products, as well, again versus what we expected, they still grew, but just a bit lower as we moved through the quarter. And then Morning Peak, as I said in my prepared remarks, that accelerated linked quarter, which was great because we're starting to see real traction around some of the throughput things we're working. But again, the acceleration we saw as we moved through the quarter wasn't quite as much as we'd hoped. And so, that's how I would describe the slowdown. It wasn't really in that promotional afternoon period, and we didn't see any impact from what we do with Starbucks Rewards other than continued lift and acceleration.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much. When you look at the last four or so quarters in the U.S., transactions have been roughly flat. So, it seems like you're not attracting new customers, you're getting a lot out of your existing customers, and that's been one of the benefits of My Starbucks Rewards. So, when you talk to the customers that either aren't going or lapsed, what do they want to see from Starbucks that would get them to come? In other words, is it a value issue that keeps them away? I mean, retail may be tough, but many QSRs are thriving in this environment. Maybe it's because you're emphasizing value and that's not the game that they play. But what is it that people who don't go to Starbucks want that you can try to provide them that would get them to come? It seems like the brand is well known, but it's narrowly used.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, John, this is Kevin. I'll comment and then hand it over to Matt to add to this. I think, as Scott said, there's no evidence that the discounting that's going on amongst the value players is affecting us. I think they serve a different market and we're very focused on the product innovation and the more premium experience that we think attracts a different customer type. And so, the things that we've got to continue to do are number one, we've got to ensure that operational excellence in our stores is maintained and constantly enhanced. Now, we saw growth in every daypart. A lot of the operational enhancements in our stores has been focused on peak to make sure that we're creating a great improved experience in those stores with high volumes with Mobile Order & Pay, great progress there. And then it's also product innovation. I think, as John mentioned, the product innovation we've had both around food and beverage has helped us in the lunch daypart, in the afternoon daypart. And then the third aspect, in addition to a great in-store experience in food and beverage innovation is as we bring new customers into Starbucks, one of the most important things we want to do is find ways to establish a digital mobile relationship with those customers, even if they're not at the point of joining the Rewards program.", "And so, that's a lot of what Matt talked about in his section on the digital agenda. We're going to now start opening the aperture of the reach that we can get with the digital mobile relationship and we're going to start by experimenting with things on this guest checkout and some other initiatives that we have on the digital side. But I think the key has got to be a great in-store experience and innovative new food and beverage offers that bring those customers in or perhaps, who are less frequent into the stores and then figure out how to translate that into a longer relationship. And I'll let Matt extend his thoughts.", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah. Not a lot more to add to that except for that when you're in a difficult periodic from time-to-time operating environment, what becomes very critical is your ability to talk to customers. And we saw that clearly in the results. It wasn't anything more than our ability to communicate that helped bring in our Starbucks Rewards customers at the level they were doing. So, for us it's important to extend the number of relationships we have so that we can continue to bring people into the franchise and we have plans to do that.", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "This is Howard. I was just going to remind people, we seem to be focusing a great deal on the slowdown in the second half of the quarter, and potentially the early part of April, but let's re-establish the fact that we had a 5% comp in the quarter and a 1% increase in traffic. We have not seen any other retailer or QSR company this quarter report a 5% comp. So, while you are beating us up a bit for lowering comps for Q4, which is the better part of valor because we are only three weeks into July, which is linked to the last quarter, let's reestablish common language. We had a 5% comp, 1% increase in traffic, and a 6% increase in China, mostly on traffic, while we're doubling down on the growth and development in China, which we have said publicly will be as large or bigger than our U.S. business. But once again, 5% comp, your number, in the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.", "Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you very much. My question is with respect to sort of looking at the earnings side related in the fourth quarter to that 2% to \u2013 3% to 4% comp that 12% to 13% growth. How much of that earnings growth is reflective of that 3% to 4% environment versus some new investments that you started to begin to talk about that are going to take effect in yield in 2018? I wonder is the model supportive in a 3% to 4% comp environment, 12% to 13% EPS or is that diluted also from some ramped-up investment to return to mid-single digit comps for 2018?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Great. Thanks for the question, Matt. Just to remind you, what we guided last quarter for the fourth quarter, I think it's important for the question. So, last quarter, we adjusted our rest of year earnings guidance because of an impact we saw from the Teavana mall store performance. That will continue as we get ready to close those stores. We also significantly increased our investment, primarily in the fourth quarter around what we call Cyber Retail, so Reserved, Roastery and Princi, as well as digital.", "So, the short answer is indeed the fourth quarter reflects an acceleration in those investments, so that's important. And then the second thing is there is a little bit of slowdown in the earnings growth in the fourth quarter compared to what we guided last time from the lower comps, both in the U.S. and in Japan, but the last quarter, you'll remember, we adjusted fourth quarter because of those investments, so that is an increase as we move through the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hi. So, taking a step back, if, hypothetically speaking, some of these headwinds, whether it's retail traffic or food app, food away from homes don't go away, are there particular things that we should be looking at or initiatives layering on the horizon that you think would be able to be pretty proactive changes in the comp trajectory? Specifically, the digital management tool, is that so that you can go back to driving growth at peak in those stores? Maybe the Mercato lineup, just anything you can kind of think of layering in going out through fiscal 2018? Thanks.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, Karen. This is Kevin. I'll comment and then hand it over to Matt. Clearly, the initiatives that we're driving around food and innovation around food and beverage is driving lift today, and that's going to continue to help us in comp going forward, independent of what's happening in the industry and the initiatives that we have in digital. And sort of the outline that Matt took you through.", "I think the fundamental improvements we're making in throughput and the customer experience, especially at peak, those are three things that are giving us good results today and those results will continue. So, Matt maybe I'll let you comment a bit more on the digital.", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah. Just to re-summarize digital, you have to think about it as short-term and long-term things we can do to unlock value in digital. In the short term, we're going to continue to lean in hard to personalization and that spend per member metric (01:06:36), so we see that coming. But we also have a major opportunity to lean hard on customer acquisition, as well too, and we have strong plans throughout the remainder of this quarter and into next to do exactly that.", "In addition to that, moving forward, we laid out some broad ideas for where the digital flywheel goes down the road, and by broadening the digital flywheel beyond the narrow aperture of people with stored value cards and Rewards right now, we see large long-term opportunities for growth by creating more digital relationships. And we see, even in a tough environment like today, digital relationships enable us to communicate with customers and bring them into our stores with frequency.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. Matt, Kevin, you both mentioned detailed plans to get after the digital customer and acquiring those customers has a powerful impact. That growth in that customer has slowed over the last few quarters and you're talking about the Chase collaboration. Is that the major way that you're going to get after getting new customers? And if so, do you have any sense of how meaningful that can be and what the runway would be? Thank you.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "There are a few things here. First of all, just as a reminder that the lower 8% number that we reported in membership growth for Starbucks Rewards this quarter was a result of having had last year an unusual growth in Q3. So, if you look at our two-year growth, it's still at 26% year-on-year and it's fairly consistent.", "That said, we know that there's more for us to do and we're going to continue to lean in. Chase will become a reason why we'll engage more people down the road, but in the short term, we see some significant promotional and just old-fashioned block and tackle customer acquisition opportunities in the quarter ahead, as well as continued improvements to the user experience and the sign-up experience to reduce frictions that cause people to drop off in the activation funnel. So, we're leaning in hard in that in the short term and then we have a lot more plans in the longer term including Chase.", "Matthew Ryan - Starbucks Corp.", "David, I'd just remind you that the increase from last year that was higher than normal was when we launched the new program. We had a lot of marketing and promotion against that.", "John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.", "And David, one of the things I would just add, this is John, we are also looking at ways that we can activate our customers in the stores. How can our stores become much more active to activate and bring new Rewards members into the program and that's something else we're looking at, as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is now open.", "Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Yeah, thanks. I guess it's along the lines of these investments, and you guys talked about some investments last quarter as well. Were these contemplated in the longer-term guidance that you had provided or are you sort of stepping up the level of investment here in the near term and we should expect that to put a bit more pressure on margins than usual, I guess, particularly in the Americas segment? Thanks.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Let's talk about this year and then the longer term. Jason, what I would say is last quarter we definitely stepped up the level of investments this year and that's part of the reason we adjusted guidance last quarter. And as I responded to Matt, that was a piece of the reason the fourth quarter earnings growth decelerates a little bit. Broadly, what I said about the three different investments in the profile, is for Siren Retail investments, so, Reserve Roastery and Princi. Those, as far as their impact on margin this year, I think it's at its peak this year. We will continue to grow those investments from a dollar basis, but because we have a significant number of Roasteries that are in pre-opening right now, the impact on March is pretty high. And as we get into next year, it will be lower. It will still increase in investment. When I look at partner investments, I think we're in the middle of that cycle, so, we'll continue to lean in on partner investments as we get into next year although again, we'll talk to you a little bit on what happens from a margin standpoint as it relates to those.", "On digital investments, we continue to grow that and it will continue to grow from a dollar spend year-on-year. Some of that is capitalized, so the impact on margin and P&L is a little bit less. But the reality is, all of those investments, particularly around digital and around partner investments, we need to continue to make those because they're driving the kind of returns that allowed us to do a 5% comp this year and take additional share.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.", "Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Kevin, switching gears a little bit, your discussion about the opportunity to partner with third-party digital firms reminds me of around five years ago when Starbucks discussed opportunities to partner with third-party technology or financial services companies and monetize the My Starbucks Rewards loyalty data. Just given your background and connections in the tech space, are these partnerships you're looking to enter involve revisiting these conversations?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Well, I think, Andrew, clearly, the entire retail sector is going through this massive disruption and it's clear that the winners coming out of this are going to be those companies who find elegant ways to bring an in-store experience together with a digital experience. And I highlighted the number of examples of companies and the work they're doing, you know, including the most recent discussion around Amazon's announcement to combine with Whole Foods. And so, we certainly have a lot of experience in different partnerships with digital tech companies that we've engaged in over the years. And I think we're continuing to have dialogue with a number of pure-play tech companies around are there things that we could do that create significant breakthroughs? And we're going to continue those discussions and see where it leads us. But it is about accelerating the pace of transformation that we're going through. Howard, you want to add to that, please?", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "I would just add, as Kevin had in his prepared remarks, what we've seen over the last few months with Walmart and Jet.com and PetSmart and Chewy and most recently Amazon and Whole Foods, I think this is just, we're in the nascent stage of these kinds of commercial relationships that are going to elevate the experience of a brick-and-mortar retail company. And having said that, Starbucks is probably best positioned, given our national footprint, the demography of our customers, and where we're located to have those kinds of conversations. I think it would be premature to kind of get into who they are, but clearly, we are a very viable partner, given the change in the industry.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, guys. One more, I guess, on the margin side of things. It seems like the focus on the mix in the Americas U.S. stores is shifting more to food and kind of hand-crafted beverages, which, I think, have lower gross margins, as you pointed out, more labor complexity to them. What is the offset to that over time, if in fact, that's going to continue to be the sort of main products that help drive comp right now?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, Andy, what I would say is hand-crafted beverages actually have some of the higher margins on a gross margin basis that we have in our stores. So, that includes iced teas and espresso beverages, very high gross margins and actually quite high operating margins, as well, even with the labor. But I take the spirit of your question. The way I would describe it is the challenge we have a bit with our mix is mostly versus what we had forecast in the quarter, where food is actually coming in a little bit stronger, which is a good thing because it's accretive to operating margin after leveraging all of the fixed cost and labor and rent, so that's the first thing. Where we've come up a bit short, and it's pressuring gross margins is, we just don't have quite as much beverage comp as we would like to see. So, adding more hand-crafted beverages, more iced teas, more core beverages, that will help with the mix challenge that we have. And I think as you see comps hopefully accelerate as we move through and into next year, that will help with the gross margin. So, it's really strong food growth and a little bit underweighted mix from beverage.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, guys, just one quick one. Can you just help us on the China business provide any insight into just the recent margin profile and sort of rough margin breakdown? As we think about sort of over the longer-term China's contribution to the growth algorithm, is this something that's going to be additive to the longer-term algorithm or do you view it as replacing some of the U.S. contribution, just given the size and scale of that business? I guess, is it an additive piece or maybe more of a replacing, in terms of the longer-term thinking?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, Greg, let me start. This is Kevin and then I'll hand it over to Scott for some specifics. First of all, we have been in China now for 18 years. And as a company, we have worked very diligently to build our brand, build relationships with our partners, create beautiful stores, a connection to customers, and when you think about a consumer brand that has more reach and relevance across China, it's hard to think of anyone that is better positioned.", "Number two, the unification of Mainland China as a company operated model will enable us to accelerate the pace of growth, and do it in a way consistent with the values and the culture that we've created in China. We have a world-class leadership team with Belinda right here on the phone with us today. And so if you think about the next two decades, I think the growth opportunities before us are unparalleled by anyone. So, I think of this as we have two major growth engines for Starbucks: the U.S. that's operating at scale and China that has this huge runway of growth in the form of new stores and reaching millions, tens of millions, of more customers. And so, both of them are core to what we are doing and they're core to our strategy, which is why the strategic actions we announced today, we believe are the right things to do because it allows us to put more energy and more focus behind the things that matter the most. Scott, you want to...", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, I think the only thing I would add to that is when you look at the performance of China, we've got 20% revenue growth and operating income is growing quite a bit faster than that. So, operating margins in China have been expanding at a pretty rapid rate over the last handful of years. So, as we look at this acquisition, we see significant opportunity once we get through probably the first year or so, where we get a little investment done, some integration done to significantly accelerate the East China market and broaden the types of returns we've seen across the rest of Mainland China.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Belinda, do you want to add anything before we close the conversation on China?", "Belinda Wong - Starbucks Greater China", "Sure. Thank you. What I would add is that the momentum for our business here has never been stronger, and it's really the early days of China. Yes, we have been investing heavily ahead of the curve, but we're really just in chapter one and I think this acquisition will really well position us to leverage our scale and the infrastructure we already built. But again, this is only at its very early stage and we have to continue to invest in our infrastructure, our system, and especially our people. And with the middle class rising, the coffee consumption rising, people picking up more and more drinking coffee, I see enormous opportunities ahead, and we're really just getting started.", "And one last thing I would add is that our job every day here is to make new friends and get new connections going and really being very good at getting new customers to understand Starbucks and to go through the Starbucks journey. That is what we have been doing the last 18 years, basically, and I see that as our focus and we'll stay laser-focused on bringing new customers into our business and continue on with our new store growth in China.", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "The question that was asked earlier of Kevin regarding potential commercial partnerships with tech companies or pure-play digital companies, we've learned a great deal from the relationship we have with Tencent in China. In only six months we've had over 2 million social gift transactions, which is just an unbelievable level of acceleration and velocity in a very short period of time. We do not have social gifting at that level here in the U.S., but clearly, we've got sightline on what that could be in the U.S. and the relationship that we have built with Tencent.", "So, the other thing I'd say is when you asked the question, a lot of the answer is based on the fact that bricks-and-mortar retailers are in need of a pure-play digital partner. But what we're also seeing in these discussions is that the digital companies and tech companies realize more than ever that there's going to be one customer interface, and that interface is as important to a tech company to have a brick-and-mortar relationship as it is for a brick-and-mortar relationship company to have a digital relationship.", "And so, once again, I think you're going to see lots of these kinds of things take place, as well as what I've been saying for the last few years, and that is, a level of consolidation and store closures, which we've all seen. But Starbucks, despite the cyclical issue of the macro environment, we are in the mix not only in these conversations, but clearly, the level of store growth, the level of customer profile, and the continuation of the velocity of building the equity of the brand domestically and around the world, and as Kevin said, the power we have to grow two businesses at once, a more mature business that clearly is not saturated here in the U.S. with the number of stores we continue to open with great success, and as Belinda said, the very early, nascent stages of what we're going to have, which is thousands of retail stores in China, multiple points of distribution in terms of product, and a digital relationship with multiple companies, based on the fact that the consumer in China is well more advanced than the U.S. consumer in terms of being a digital native.", "And we are at the intersection of that in ways that no other brick-and-mortar company is in China, based on the fact that we're in 130 cities with 2,800 stores, but it's also the profile of the consumer in China, and with almost $1 million AUV in the morning ritual starting in China building almost every day, this business in China, I think, is significantly underestimated both by the people who analyze our business and, I think, candidly, in the market value of Starbucks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray", "Thank you. Good afternoon. I very much respect and understand the prudent nature of revising your guidance as you exit the year. The number one question I get asked from investors, so I'm hoping you'd be willing to address it, is why not just do so for the long-term guided range? I think the algorithm currently states 10% to 15%, and again, it's the number one question I get asked. So, do you want us to think about that differently going forward, either to the lower end or an actual restatement or removal of that as you go forward? Again, just to the nature of being as transparent and prudent as you can be. Thank you so much.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Nicole, this is Kevin. Thank you for the question. As we think about long-range guidance going forward, we certainly understand and acknowledge the question. People look and say, FY 2017 year-to-date performance has been slightly below that long-range guidance, and so it's a valid question.", "First of all, I think it's important to know that when we guide for fiscal year 2018 next quarter, we will also in that guide provide you with any updates to our long-range guidance. Now, you might say well, why do you wait until then? Well, look, we've got line of sight to what \u2013 these strategic announcements we made today. Scott commented on the fact that East China acquisition is neutral to accretive in year one. We've got some variability in the Teavana mall store in terms of the pace of closures that we've got to work through over this next quarter. And so, I think it's important for us to take the time to ensure that if there are any other strategic actions we take between now and Q4, that we factor those into long-range guidance, that we have the final results for FY 2017 as the basis for long-range guidance. And then, frankly, we're right in the middle of creating our annual operating plan for fiscal year 2018. And we think it's important that that annual operating plan is completed as part of any update we give in long-range guidance. And then you should expect that on our October call.", "And I appreciate that's a question and I know it's an important one and I just ask for your patience, but we are completing the process and the things to do it thoughtfully and responsibly and be transparent with you and our investors.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Your line is now open.", "Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.", "Yeah, thank you. Wanted to shift back to China for a minute if we could. If we're able to look out one, two, three years down the road, will we be talking more about tea, coffee, or food growth in China? And how do you think that that might change versus what you're seeing today?", "John Winchester Culver - Starbucks Corp.", "This is John. I know that you'll be talking about growth across all those categories. Clearly, the growth of espresso-based beverages and the way in which our customers in China have embraced that, we see a long runway for growth, and we have a strong innovation pipeline around that. In the comments we talk about tea and the growth of tea that we've seen since we've introduced Teavana being at nearly 60% in China and Japan, and so tea will continue to be a focused area as well.", "In food, we've just done a lot of work around transforming our food program in China and rolling that out to our stores and we're seeing traction. So, we're going to continue to grow across all categories. And when we open up the Shanghai Roastery, that will give us a whole other level of innovation that we are going to be able to bring into our stores, whether it's coffee-based beverages or tea-based beverages or our food items. So, Belinda, I don't know if you want to make any...", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, Belinda, maybe you could give us some more color and share a little bit more of how you're driving both food and beverage innovation and what you see unfolding here over the next few years in China.", "Belinda Wong - Starbucks Greater China", "Yes, well, thank you. When you look at our 7% comp, what's nice about it is it's mostly from transactions. So, we're getting new customers to come in and trial the experience. And also, what's nice about that is we see growth in all dayparts. That means we're serving different segments of customers. Some come in for our breakfast and we're seeing morning daypart increase as well as the afternoon and evening. So, we continue to open stores to serve different customers and their needs.", "Like what John said, we're heavy up on our investment on food. We're also seeing great results from our launch of Teavana from last year, especially summertime right now and the iced tea is doing very well. And this is only the beginning and we're going to double-down again on our investment for afternoon refreshment in the tea category, especially in the afternoon segment.", "So, I guess what I'll summarize it to be is that, we're going to laser-focus on making sure all dayparts will be relevant for different customers, depending on the location, the cities that we're in. We're also opening a lot of new stores and entering new cities as we meet our customer for the first time. So, we're doing all that at the same time, and I'm very certain that we'll see growth in all dayparts coming in the next few years.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar Research. Your line is open.", "R.J. Hottovy - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Thanks. Just one last question on U.S. and really around product innovation here. One of the things we're hearing from a lot of the QSR and other restaurant firms is more on the menu simplification part of the equation, and obviously, it seems like you're going against the grain on that with more products and more innovation. What's the right balance? What is your analysis showing in terms of the right balance with the right amount of products on the menu? Is it something that could streamline and speed up the throughput process? Just kind of curious to get your thoughts on that as you look at a number of the things within the restaurants?", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "R.J., this is Kevin, I'll start and then hand over to Scott to add to it. First of all, one of the things that we're always very thoughtful about, as we're doing innovation around food and beverage, is to be thoughtful about how that lands in the store and the experience it creates for our partners who prepare the food and beverage for customers and for customers. And so, if you think about much of the work we do is innovation around what we think of as platforms. And we are, in many ways in beverage, we have the capability to customize beverages for individual customers at scale. And the way we've been able to do that is be very thoughtful about the platforms that we launch and then the things that differentiate or allow a customer to differentiate and customize that platform. Example would be when you think about our espresso platform. Certainly, customers can substitute different types of milks, whether it's coconut milk or almond milk and the set of things we've done there. Flavor profiles.", "So, by being thoughtful about how we do that innovation, we actually do it in a way that simplifies that customization in our stores for our partners. That said, we always have to be cautious that we're not expanding the platforms or the complexity or the SKU counts too much.", "The final comment I'll make, and I'll hand over to Scott, is that I also think we're going through an exercise right now, really looking at the SKUs and doing some SKU rationalization. We're not at end of job on that, but I think that's one that we're constantly looking at the long tail of SKUs that are low volume in stores and figuring out how to constantly prune those and put more energy than in keeping things fresh and vibrant for customers. Scott?", "Scott Harlan Maw - Starbucks Corp.", "I would only add I think Kevin nailed it on the beverage customization side. There is opportunity around food and around packaged coffee in our stores and we're in the process of looking at that, so we'll come back to you in future quarters as we work our way through that.", "Kevin R. Johnson - Starbucks Corp.", "You said last thing...", "Howard S. Schultz - Starbucks Corp.", "Yeah, just the last thing. I think one of the hallmarks of Starbucks, which continues to be highly relevant, is customization, and our ability to customize beverages is not about the number of SKUs we have. It's about the customer's demand and preference to customize their own beverage. And so, when it goes back to the question about our people and retention and the training, this is where we are at our best and this is where we do not have any other company in our space that is even second to us.", "So, I think you're going to see us play up customization at a higher level as we enter fiscal 2018, because we've always known how important that is, but it's becoming more and more important with this millennial consumer.", "So, just in closing, what I would say is we remain as optimistic as ever about the future of our company. We thought it was very prudent to really share with you what we experienced at the tail end of the quarter, and what we're experiencing the first few weeks, only three weeks into the 13-week quarter in Q4, but enough information to just be sensitive and be straight with you. We understand the question about long-term guidance, but as Kevin said, we have a lot to absorb and digest while we are in the AOP period, and like always, we'll be straight up and be very honest with you about where we stand. But our optimism for what we're doing inside the U.S. and what we announced today in China has never been stronger, so you should hang up this call, I hope, with realizing how bullish we are and how strong we feel about the future of our company. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And at this time, I'd like to turn it over to Tom for any closing remarks.", "Tom Shaw - Starbucks Corp.", "Thanks again, everybody, for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter earnings call, which we have tentatively scheduled for Thursday, November 2.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "I will now turn the call over to Tom Shaw, Vice President Investor Relations. Mr. Shaw, you may now begin your conference.", "Tom Shaw", "Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2018. Today's discussion will be led by Kevin Johnson, President and CEO; and Scott Maw, CFO. For Q&A, we'll be joined by Roz Brewer, Group President Americas and Chief Operating Officer; Cliff Burrows, Group President, Siren Retail; John Culver, Group President, International and Channels; Matt Ryan, Global Chief Strategy Officer; and dialing in from Milan, Howard Schultz, Executive Chairman.", "This conference call will include forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factors discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last Annual Report on Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information.", "GAAP results in fiscal 2018 includes several items related to strategic actions, including restructuring and impairment charges, transaction and integration costs, gains related to changes in ownership of international markets, and other items. These items are excluded from our non-GAAP results.", "Please refer to our website at investor.starbucks.com to find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our website as well.", "I will now turn the call over to Kevin.", "Kevin Johnson", "Well, thank you, Tom, and welcome, everyone. Starbucks reported another quarter of record financial results in Q1 of fiscal 2018, highlighted by continued acceleration in our China/Asia Pacific segment. On today's call, I will provide an overview of company-wide performance in Q1 with a particular emphasis on our two unique and powerful global growth engines: our retail businesses in the U.S. and China.", "I'll then turn the call over to Scott, who will provide further detail on segment performance and an update on the impact of the new tax law.", "For the quarter, Starbucks delivered record revenues of $6.1 billion, a non-GAAP operating income margin of 19.2% and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.65 per share. And we opened 700 net new stores globally, with our newest class of stores continuing to deliver industry-leading returns and higher AUVs than the immediate prior class.", "China once again our fastest growing market in Q1, with 6% comp growth, driven entirely by increased transactions and 30% revenue growth. Customers' response to our Shanghai Roastery has been extraordinary and the Roastery is already performing well above expectation. I'll share more details around Starbucks' plans to maximize our opportunity in China in a moment. But let me start the call with an update on our U.S. business in Q1.", "We ended Q1 with 6% revenue growth and 2% comp growth in the U.S. Continued strength in throughput at peak and strong digital performance were noteworthy highlights in the quarter. But we recognized that overall our U.S. operating performance fell short of expectation. We have isolated the drivers of our Q1 under performance and I want to take you through both the details and the corresponding actions we are taking.", "Through the first half of the quarter, our U.S. comps were 3%, with strong performance at peak, more than offsetting some softness in the afternoon. But as we launched our holiday program in mid-November, we saw slowdown in transaction comps, bringing total comps for the back half of the quarter to roughly 1% with transaction comps slightly negative. Even though we grew operating income, these developments contributed to margin compression we experienced in the U.S. compared to Q1 a year ago.", "The decline in transaction comp was primarily driven by two factors. First, while traditionally contributing to Q1 comp growth, our limited-time holiday beverages, holiday gift-cards and holiday merchandise available for purchase in our stores' lobby underperformed in Q1. Holiday LTOs and merchandise did not resonate with our customers as planned.", "Let me be more specific. In Q1, our food comp was 2%. Our core beverage comp excluding holiday limited time offerings was 1%. And together, our holiday LTO and lobby items had a negative impact of over 1 point of comp. We are aggressively rationalizing our merchandise approach in conjunction with the transformation of our lobby strategy going forward.", "Second, the challenge we have discussed with you over the past several quarters involving softness in visits by occasional non-Starbucks Rewards customers, a challenge likely exacerbated by the traditional changes in customer routines and traffic patterns during holiday continued with our afternoon and evening dayparts, typically catering to less frequent customers and second visits for more frequent customers, coming under increased pressure as the quarter progressed.", "Another proof-point of changes in holiday routines was negative mall-store comp performance, several points below non-mall locations as we move through the quarter. As a reminder, mall stores comprise only 6% of our U.S. company-operated locations.", "We have a clear understanding of the issue and are accountable to fix it just as we did with throughput at peak. The strength of our core customers, the performance of our business through the morning and lunch daypart, and upcoming food beverage and digital innovation gives us confidence that we will be successful in doing so.", "Let me now share our plans for bringing the business to targeted levels of revenue growth, operating performance and profitability through the lens of the six operational priorities we set out for you last year. These priorities remain the drivers of our growth, and they will enable a turning of our U.S. business. Our commitment to these priorities is unwavering.", "Let me start with our efforts to accelerate U.S. comps across all dayparts. We continue to reap the benefits of the success of our efforts to increase throughput at peak. Specifically, our highest peak volume stores continue to out-comp the average for our U.S. portfolio overhaul; with efforts around staffing, technology and lean principles all yielding measureable results.", "We've now seen three successive quarters of sustained positive comp growth at peak. And believe that plan enhancements will continue this trend and are encouraged by our ability to have so quickly rallied our store partners, equip them with the tools technology and resources, to successfully improve operations.", "We will apply the same disciplined approach to improve performance in the afternoon daypart, and have identified a number of key operational actions that are underway. We are focused on elevating the Starbucks experience in the afternoon daypart, as store-partners sharpen operational focus, and tune staffing and scheduling, simplification processes, and leverage improved routines and lean techniques.", "We're also driving continued innovation in food and beverage. Our Mercato fresh food menu is continuing to perform well in Seattle and Chicago, the two markets we launched last year. And we are planning to deploy Mercato in at least six new markets in fiscal 2018.", "We recently launched Blonde espresso roast. This is the first time we've offered a second espresso roast in our stores. We believe this roast is appealing to a broad audience, seeking a lighter, sweeter espresso experience.", "We have a big opportunity to leverage our core beverage platforms, particularly in ice coffee, tea, Cold Brew and Draft beverages, all of which skewed toward the afternoon. In response to strong customer demand, we are accelerating the rollout of Nitro Cold Brew from 1,300 stores currently to 2,300 stores in the U.S. by the end of the year.", "We have seen approximately 1 point of additional comp growth in stores offering Nitro Cold Brew during 2017. Nitro also provides the foundation for a broader platform of Draft beverages that expand beyond coffee to include alternative milks and tea-based Nitro-infused beverages.", "Our plant based beverage platform continues to expand, leveraging almond, coconut and soymilk alternatives. Our refreshment platform including tea and Starbucks refreshers contributed comp growth again this quarter. These beverage platforms also aligned with our focus on the afternoon occasion.", "In addition to food and beverage innovation, we continue to accelerate the power and momentum of our digital flywheel. An initiative that has taken on added significance as we look to materially expand our universe of digitally connected Starbucks customers beyond only Rewards members.", "Let me touch on five developments that underscore the progress we made against this priority in Q1. We added over 1.4 million active Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S., up 11% year-over-year, and now have 14.2 million active members. Mobile payment in the U.S. has grown to over 30% of total tender. The ubiquity of mobile and credit card payment is enabling us to begin an exploration of cashless stores in the U.S.", "We expect payment methods will continue to evolve with acceptance increasingly becoming the global currency of the future. Building on partnerships with companies like Chase, Tencent, Alibaba and others, enables us to explore new ideas that leverage our digital assets, global retail footprint and global customer base with the digital payment platforms of today, while also monitoring the landscape of potential payment platforms of the future. Through our Rewards program, we continue to drive increases in per member spend by leveraging personalized offerings and suggested selling to our customers.", "By expanding capacity at peak, we have now the ability to offer Mobile Order and Pay to our non-Rewards customers and will begin accelerating the ramp up of Mobile Order and Pay to all customers beginning in March. We are accelerating our marketing engagement to expand digital customer relationships this quarter. Here are some examples of actions underway.", "In partnership with Chase and Visa, we are launching a co-branded credit card in February. These customers will earn Stars at an accelerated rate at Starbucks as well as earn Stars everywhere else they shop.", "In April also with Chase and Visa, we are launching a co-branded stored value card targeted to customers who don't want or can't qualify for credit cards. This card will also let customers earn Stars wherever Visa is accepted. In March, we are launching a significant marketing initiative to sign up customers for special offers outside of Starbucks Rewards, with only 14 million of the 75 million or so unique customers, who visit us each month signed up for Rewards, we have a tremendous opportunity to leverage our new digital technologies to initiate and advance additional direct digital relationships.", "By the end of the fiscal year, we expect to establish millions of incremental digital customer relationships outside of Starbucks Rewards, giving us an entirely new direct marketing capability to a vast customer audience. We will update you on progress of our digital expansion initiatives as we move through the year.", "To date our U.S. business is a key driver of Starbucks overall financial performance, and while we face challenges in Q1 with holiday merchandise and LTOs, we are making progress against clear and consistent priorities with total customer transactions across new and existing stores up 5% year-on-year. Last year, we successfully dealt with our morning daypart and peak throughput issues, and we are applying the same rigor to addressing the occasional customer and the afternoon daypart issues.", "We look forward to updating you on our progress, as we tune our U.S. retail growth engine to continue delivering industry leading growth, profitability and return on investment long into the future. Enabling long term growth in China is a key priority, as it now represents our second largest and consistently our fastest growing market.", "Starbucks has been operating outside of North America since the opening of our first store in Japan in 1996. Today, we operate half of our stores nearly 14,000, in 75 markets outside the U.S. The growing relevance and success of our international business and specifically our business in China has emerged as a growth driver that is rapidly moving us beyond our longstanding dependence on our U.S. business for needle moving growth.", "Today, we have two powerful independent but complementary engines driving Starbucks global growth, with a long term opportunity clearly visible in China. Starbucks has cracked the code in China, and no Western consumer brand is better positioned than Starbucks in China. You have to experience our business in China for yourself to fully appreciate it, but we are much more than simply a coffee retail. As our world leading financial and operating performance attest.", "Let me share a few metrics that underscore the size of Starbucks China opportunity. In 2014, China's GDP totaled $11 trillion, and many economists expected to exceed $15 trillion by 2021. Rapid GDP growth is fueling a massive increase in China's middle class expected to reach 600 million consumers by 2021, up 100% from three years ago and almost twice the size of the total U.S. population.", "From an investment thesis, we have best-in-class unit economics, decades of whitespace to grow in both physical and digital retail, the most trusted brick and mortar brand in the market, and a world class management team. And we are in the nascent stages of building a business that will continue to deliver an increased portion of our revenue and operating income growth. The deep respect we have for our customers and partners in China, and that our customers and partners in China have for the Starbucks brand and each other have resulted in rapid sustained customer and market growth.", "And the strong underlying revenue and profit trends of the past will drive the many decades of growth on the horizon. Leveraging our digital flywheel continues to represent a huge opportunity and unlocked for us in China. Since launching WeChat pay one year ago and adding Alipay in September, digital payments have increased over 60% of total tender. 90 day active Starbucks Rewards members now total over 6 million.", "And our e-commerce and social gifting in China represented nearly $20 million in Q1, up threefold from a year ago. These are the reasons we feel comfortable doubling down on China through the East China acquisition, the transaction we closed in December.", "East China is now being integrated into our company operated business enabling us the benefit and further leverage, Belinda Wong's world class China management team as well as the scale economics that come with it. As we complete the integration of East China, we will look to further accelerate our new store growth in China. I have no doubt that one day Starbucks will have more stores in China than we have in the U.S., and it's the reason we selected Shanghai for Starbucks' first international Roastery highlighting our fifth operating priority, elevating the Starbucks experience through Roasteries and Reserve.", "Starbuck's Shanghai Roastery opened only last month providing further evidence of our future opportunity in China and is among the crowning achievements in the company's history. Customers in some cases are lined up for hours to enter the Roastery and be taken on an immersive multi-sensory coffee, food and tea journey. On its very first day of operation the Shanghai Roastery became the highest grossing Starbucks store in the world, averaging more than double the number of transactions of our highly successful Seattle Roastery, and with an average ticket of $29.", "The unparalleled retail experience delivered by the Shanghai Roastery will enable us to serve well over a million customers every year. At the same time amplifies and elevates the Starbucks brand across China and CAP overall. Noteworthy is that our Starbucks Roastery in Seattle continues to delight customers and drive double-digit comps. In November, we opened the Princi bakery and cafe in the Seattle Roastery, and are already seeing significant lift to total food sales.", "The Princi bakery and cafe in the Shanghai Roastery is also driving significant customer engagement and revenue. The artisan nature and high quality of Princi baked goods are resonating loudly with our customers. And we see a major opportunity to increase sales of Princi food beyond Roasteries. We are now venturing into building standalone Princi bakeries complete with Starbucks Reserve coffee and coffee bars. These stores will feature Reserve coffees, Princi food and design with the elements of the Roastery design and product experience for customers and markets across the globe.", "Starbucks Roasteries, Starbucks Reserve brand and Princi, operations that we refer to collectively as Siren Retail remains central to our innovation capabilities and our strategy of maintaining our leadership position as the leading premium coffee retailer. We currently have four Roasteries under construction and the potential opportunity for Princi bakeries with Reserve coffee over the next decade. The opportunity is significant, as we are off to an excellent beginning to what we believe is an emerging food revenue and profit stream over time.", "As we pursue our Starbucks Reserve strategy, we benefit from the decades of experience that Howard brings to this business. As Tom mentioned, Howard is joining the call today from Milan, where he's working on our next international Roastery, and he's available to share his thoughts during Q&A.", "Our channels business is focused on our sixth operational priority of gaining share of at-home coffee, Scott will cover this in more detail. But in Q1, we grew share in the premium single-serve and packaged coffee categories to a record level, despite an increasingly competitive environment. We have built a powerful CPG business in the U.S. and are committed to leveraging that business to create additional shareholder value going forward, while we invest in the priorities I've outlined, we also continue to make progress against our efforts to streamline the company.", "Besides completing the East China acquisition, in Q1, we also closed on the sale of Tazo to Unilever, transition Taiwan to a license market, and continue to close Teavana retail stores in Canada and the U.S. We plan to have all U.S. and Canada Teavana stores closed by the end of this month. Going forward you may expect this to take additional actions to further streamline the company and unlock value.", "A few final points, while we recognize that our revenue, comp and EPS performance in Q1 fell short of both our current quarter and long term guidance, I want to make clear that our commitment to our long term growth targets and strategy, including our commitment to returning $15 billion to shareholders over the next three years in the form of dividends and buybacks is unwavering.", "We have sight line on the areas that need to be addressed in our U.S. business, and Roz Brewer and her team are aggressively pursuing the improvement plans I shared with you today. And I assure you that we are just embarking on what will ultimately prove to be the most powerful and compelling growth opportunity in Starbucks history, China.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Scott?", "Scott Maw", "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks Q1 of fiscal 2018 reflected solid revenue growth of 6% or 7% after adjusting for a point of impact for the licensing of our business in Singapore, the sale of our Tazo tea business, the exit of our e-commerce business and the continued wind down of our Teavana stores, all streamline driven activities.", "I will talk more about the makeup of these activities later. Q1 2018 represented the first $6 billion revenue quarter in our history. We earned $0.65 of non-GAAP EPS in Q1, including $0.07 of benefit from the U.S. tax law change and $0.02 of favorability below the operating income line from a true-up of our liability for unredeemed gift cards, principally from first time breakage recognition for market outside the U.S. and Canada.", "Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.2% represented a decline of 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales to leverage and food mix shift in the Americas. Despite delivering record results in Q1, we've recognized that we did not meet all of our expectations for the quarter, but as Kevin shared we are laser focused on executing against plans to drive improvement across the U.S. business, as we move into Q2 and through the back half of the year.", "I'll now take you through our Q1 operating performance by segment. Our Americas segment grew revenue 7% in Q1, primarily driven by 979 net new store openings over the past 12 months and a 2% comp growth, principally ticket. Americas operating margin declined 100 basis points to 23% in the quarter, primarily due to lower than expected revenues and food related mix shift resulting from increased customer adoption and the increasing success of our food program.", "Kevin covered the key operating metrics and actions for the Americas segment, so let's move on to China/Asia Pacific. CAP segment revenues grew 9% in Q1 to a new quarterly record $844 million, once again delivering company leading top line growth. Comp growth of 6% in China was driven by strong performance of core food and beverage categories, including improved breakfast and bakery offerings and growth in espresso. We entered seven new cities and opened a Q1 record 188 stores in China, and now own and operate over 3,100 stores in 138 cities.", "Our newest class of stores in China continues to outperform even the immediately prior class and deliver record revenues and profits, and our best returns anywhere in the world. CAP's non-GAAP operating margin increased by 210 basis points, driven primarily by strong performance in China and South Korea; CAP's non-GAAP operating income increased nearly 20% to $212 million, once again representing the majority of Starbucks operating income growth in the quarter.", "Regarding Japan, while overall profitability, new store performance and total revenue remained in line with our expectations upon acquiring a 100% of the market. Our comp store performance continues to be impacted by softness in limited time offerings, Frappuccino LTOs, in particular. We remain committed to turning Japan back to positive comp growth, as we work through the mix shift issues. The new Japan Starbucks Rewards program launched only last quarter continues to resonate with our customers, we've already added over 600,000 new Rewards members up 45% in a few short months.", "Turning to EMEA. EMEA delivered revenue growth of 8% to $284 million or up 3% after adjusting for five points of foreign exchange. Company operated store comp declined 1% driven by stock comps in the UK. Noteworthy is that today less than 20% of our EMEA total store portfolio is company owned, that's a better measure of the performance of the EMEA segment is system wide comps, which grew 3% in Q1, despite the difficult consumer, economic and geopolitical backdrop.", "Operating margin of 13.8% declined 300 basis points over last year. Margin expansion in our licensed business was strong and in line with expectations driven by successful new store openings and strong system comps, but this was more than offset by under performance in our company owned markets. We remain committed to both growing Starbucks profitable and successful license business, and lowering our EMEA overhead structure.", "On to channel development. Channel development revenues reached $560 million in Q1, up 1% year-over-year, but up 4% after adjusting for 3 points of impact from the Tazo sale this quarter, and a change in accounting treatment for certain receivables compared to 2017. On top of 8% growth and 16% growth in the first quarters' of fiscal 2017 and 2016 respectively, while we achieved record market share in both premium roast and ground and K-Cups, and our core U.S. CPG business in Q1, revenue has been impacted by increased competition down the aisle.", "Our bottled coffee business with Pepsi delivered strong overall results again in Q1, also we now have sold over 1.9 million bottles of Teavana bottled tea through the partnership we have with Anheuser-Busch launched last year. And we still expect to launch Teavana packaged tea down the aisle before the end of 2018.", "And in China, we have sold 30 million bottles of Frappuccino beverages, since launching our relationship with Tingyi five quarters ago. We now offer an expanding lineup of bottled coffee beverages for Chinese consumers to enjoy at home, at work or on the go. Each of these partnerships is a successful example of the power of combining the Starbucks brand with the product marketing and distribution capability of leading food and beverage companies.", "Channel Development's operating margin remained strong at 43.4%, down slightly from last year given lower sales flow through. Before moving on to full year fiscal 2018 targets, I'd like to identify three events that will have a significant positive impact on our financial returns moving forward. Our ongoing efforts to streamline our operations, the projected impact of our recently completed East China acquisition, and the impact of the new U.S. tax law.", "You can see specific financial impacts for each of these items in the schedules we have provided on our website, but I acknowledge the size and absolute number of these adjustments adds complexity to your analysis and modeling of our performance. Recognizing this our goal is to provide you with the insight and transparency you need to fully appreciate the meaningful lift and profitability we expect to see from each of the three areas over time.", "During the quarter, we accelerated and advanced to our efforts to streamline our business that we began discussing with you last year. As a reminder streamline is a company-wide lens through which we are examining each of our businesses in order to focus our investments on those businesses that will meaningfully contribute to revenue and profit growth, while licensing or exciting those that won't.", "During Q1, we've recognized large gains on the sale of Tazo, the acquisition of East China and the sale of Taiwan, while recording certain charges for exciting all Teavana stores among other actions. One specific example relates to product simplification, we are removing over 200 SKUs from our U.S. retail stores, primarily merchandise in the front lobbies of our stores, representing over 30% of total lobbied items. This simplification effort increases our focus and reduces operational complexity in our stores.", "And we anticipate eliminating these SKUs will lower comps by 1.5 point over the course of 2018 that have a nominal impact on profit given the lower margin and higher write-offs associated with these products. Obviously, merchandise perform this holiday underscores the importance of this effort, but it is important to note that comps in our lobbies have been quite flat to slightly negative for several years, also our full your guidance set out for 2018 included the estimated impact of the streamlining activities including the U.S. comp impact of SKU rationalization.", "Finally, we are well underway to returning the $15 billion of capital to shareholders, Kevin referenced earlier, with $2 billion returned via dividends and share repurchases this quarter, a new record for Starbucks.", "On December 31, 2017, Starbucks paid $1.4 billion, and assume full ownership of over 1,400 stores previously operated by or formally 50% owned East China JV, doubling down on China, our highest returning and fastest growing market.", "The East China business will fully be consolidated and reflected in our financial statements beginning with Q2. We expect the transaction to be neutral to slightly accretive to earnings in 2018, with a more positive impact in 2019, excluding the following estimated items: a gain on acquisition, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, and transaction and integration expenses. These items will be removed for non-GAAP reporting and adjusted as we move through 2018.", "The financial impact of consolidating East China includes a 4 percentage point lift to consolidated revenue and a slightly negative impact to consolidate operating margin. As you may recall from the acquisition of our business in Japan, the margin change is driven solely by the change in ownership, whereby we now have 100% of the revenue expense and profit, as opposed to a small portion of the revenue and roughly half the profit under the former ownership model.", "The change is expected to drive CAP segment margin moderately lower in 2018, with strong growth returning once we fully lap the acquisition in 2019. We plan to discuss these impacts in greater detail during our China modeling call on January 31. Again, the impact of East China was included when we introduced our fiscal year 2018 guidance last quarter.", "Let's move on to the change in U.S. tax law. Like most U.S. companies with international operations, we are still evaluating the impact of the U.S. tax law change on our income statement, balance sheet and capital distributions to shareholders. Future interpretation of significant aspects of the law by constituencies in Washington D.C. and related accounting guidance could have some impact on our ultimate effective tax rate for 2018, 2019 and beyond.", "With that said, let me share with you our current estimates. We expect our 2018 GAAP tax rate will be 23%, with significant impacts from the gain on the East China acquisition and transition related items from the U.S. tax law change. The East China gain will impact our 2018 effective rate by 5 points.", "Partially offsetting this is approximately 2 points or an estimated tax charge related to deemed repatriation of international earnings partially offset by an estimated tax benefit from revaluing our net deferred tax liability position at lower statutory rates. Excluding the net 3 points of favorability from these drivers, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is estimated to be 26% for 2018 and beyond or roughly 7 points below previous guidance.", "This delta provides roughly $350 million of additional net earnings before reinvestment for 2018. The majority of the savings will go to the bottom line with more than 50%, but less than 60% accruing to earnings. The vast majority of the 40% plus remaining will be invested in our US partners via wages and benefits above our plans, with the balance funding accelerated digital investment.", "Specifically, we anticipate increasing partner in digital investments by $180 million to $220 million on a run rate basis in 2018, with a little less than half of this impacting 2018 profits, given the timing of investments during this fiscal year. Also, we announced this week a onetime stock grant to our U.S. partners that we estimate will total $120 million and will impact 2018 and 2019 ratably.", "The vast majority of this grant will go to our U.S. field partners and we will exclude the stock-grant related charge from our non-GAAP results. We expect a modest amount of incremental cash flows from the tax law change, net reinvestment. I want to reiterate that these allocations and estimates will likely change over the course of 2018, but they are reasonable approximations for now.", "Let's move on to 2018 targets. We are updating the financial and operating targets we have previously provided for fiscal 2018 for the expected impacts of the U.S. tax law change and business performance in Q1. We still expect consolidated revenue growth in the high-single-digits, excluding approximately 4 points of favorability from the East China acquisition and a roughly 2 point reduction from other streamline activities.", "We also still expect comps to grow 3% to 5% for the year, consistent with our long-term guidance. Given the challenges in Q1 and expectations for a somewhat softer Q2, we expect to be near the low-end of comp guidance range for the year.", "Given the margin contraction in the first quarter and likely pressure on Q2, we now anticipate a slight operating margin decrease for both total company and the Americas for the full year before the additional partner and digital investments.", "Including these investments, we expect total company in Americas operating margins to decline moderately versus 2017. The operational priorities focused on the U.S. business that Kevin discussed and the middle of the P&L savings targeted for the balance of the year are expected to contribute to improvement in the second half of the year. Roz and the team are laser-focused on ensuring we can deliver targeted savings for the year in cost of goods sold, waste, labor and beyond.", "These savings started in Q1, but ramped as we move through the year. And we have specific action plans to ensure we obtain the savings we need by area. Excluding the ownership change impact from our purchase of East China, we still expect CAP operating margin to be moderately higher in fiscal 2018 relative to the prior year.", "Given first quarter performance, we now expect moderate expansion of EMEA operating margin in 2018. And channel development is still expected to deliver slightly improved operating margin for 2018.", "Given all these inputs, we expect fiscal 2018 GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.36, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.48 to $2.53. This is consistent with non-GAAP EPS of $2.30 to $2.33 provided on last quarter's earnings call with the impact of a lower federal statutory rate from the U.S. tax law change, net of reinvestment as the only difference.", "Although our guidance is unchanged from last quarter, to summarize and be clear, adjusted for the impact of tax law changes, we remain within our full year 2018 guidance range, given last quarter related to the key items of EPS, comps and revenue growth, but below that guidance on global margin.", "To achieve these targets we will remain disciplined with our investments and laser-focused on delivering an elevated experience to our customers while at the same time improving our comp revenue and profit in the back half of 2018. This discipline will be key to delivering our top and bottom line goals.", "As Kevin stated, we have a clear set of actions underway to improve comp growth and profitability as we move through the year. As always credit for our success in Q1 belongs to Starbucks partners around the world, who proudly wear the green apron and work to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers through nearly 100 million individual occasions every week, but who do so with heart and passion one cup at a time.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Sara Harkavy Senatore", "Thank you. I was hoping to sort of just talk a little bit about the first quarter and implied rest of the year, which is to say you suggested that holiday and merchandising was an issue. But then also noted that 2Q will be softer, which means that maybe it wasn't just holiday. If January was also off to a soft start.", "So I guess, first, are you confident that you have the right diagnosis. Is there any chance that you are either losing share or cannibalizing yourself? And then second, to what extent that can you preserve some of the earnings of the margin, if in fact, the low end of your guidance doesn't materialize through better expectations in the back-half, which is sort of what happened in 2017?", "Scott Maw", "Yeah, thanks, Sara. It's Scott. I'll start. I think what's important to understand and what we're saying about Q2 is given some of the things that happened specifically during holiday, we're seeing some impacts of that early in the second quarter. And specifically what we're seeing is we sell a lot of gift cards in the lobbies of our stores and through third parties. And those gift cards once again this year, went to about one in six Americans.", "And the gift card lows were about flat year-over-year. But as you know over the last many years, those gift cards have actually contributed meaningfully to comps. Both as we closed out the first quarter, and then, importantly in January and February, and a little bit beyond as we went through the second quarter because those gift cards were roughly flat, still sold a lot of them.", "We're just a little bit cautious on how the quarter is starting, so that's the first thing. The second thing is in the lobby category, what we see coming through into January is a little bit additional softness above what we'd expected. So Kevin talked about holiday LTOs and lobby down over a point. Lobby remains soft in January. So those two things are just a little bit of headwind.", "And so, I think what we signaled for the year is we still have a high level of competence in being within our 3% to 5% range. We're just a little bit cautious for Q2. And really EPS and revenue growth and comp growth, still holds with what we guided last quarter.", "Kevin Johnson", "And, Sara, this is Kevin, let me take your second question about share or cannibalization. I mean the short answer is no. And let me share the data with you that leads us to that conclusion. Certainly, we look at many external data sources to inform us of macro trends in away-from-home coffee and certainly away-from-home food and beverage.", "Those trends would suggest that overall daily customer occasions in food and beverage are relatively flat. Now, when we triangulate those data points with the fact that we grew total customer occasions across existing stores and new stores by 5% this quarter, that would imply that we are growing transactions faster than the market and taking some share.", "Now, the better view that we have is when we look at the micro trading areas. Now, this is where we have our own analytics, where we look at a micro trading area that provides us data on traffic patterns. And whenever we build a new store in that trading area, we have predicted analytics to tell us what we think will happen and then we have post analytics to tell us what actually happened. The data suggest that when we build a new store in a trading area, we see increased customer occasions for Starbucks.", "When a competitor builds a new store in the micro trading area, our data shows little to no impact on Starbucks' traffic in that micro trading area. Now, certainly a similar dynamic exists when a competitor runs a product or pricing promotion or schedule at a trading area. And we look at these micro trading areas very carefully. And so, that's a data driven analysis. So when you triangulate these data points, it's evidence that we're not losing share to competition. And it's evidence that we're not cannibalizing as we build new stores. And so, that's how we think about it.", "Sara Harkavy Senatore", "Okay, thanks. And then, just a question on can you preserve the P&L as the comp comes in and stays at 2?", "Scott Maw", "Yeah, I think what we said and we talked about this a little bit last quarter, Sara, is that, in order to hit the comp guidance and the revenue guidance and profit guidance, 3% to 5% high-single-digits and 12%-plus. We need that 3% in order to get to 12%-plus. With that said, given just a little bit of softness in the first-half of the year, we still think we're going to be to deliver a 3% per year and therefore deliver the full EPS and margin guidance.", "I think the thing I was trying to say in my prepared comments is, the first half of the year is probably going to be a little bit softer, with the second half of the year accelerating. Yeah, when the things we are doing on streamline, the things we're doing in the middle of the P&L, and a little bit of benefit from buyback. So I think we'll get back to 3% and preserve the margin.", "Kevin Johnson", "Yeah, I agree with that. The only thing I would add is just to be careful not to over-rotate just looking at the U.S., China is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the growth agenda and contributing a larger and larger percentage of our operating income growth. The 30% growth that we saw in China this last quarter, we just closed on East China, the Shanghai Roastery. And so, I think you need to look at both of these growth engines when you consider the overall enterprise P&L.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open.", "David Tarantino", "Hi. Good afternoon. Just one clarification on the commentary on fiscal second quarter. Are you signaling you expect it to be weaker than what you just reported for Q1 or more the same? And then, I guess, my real question is about - as you diagnose the U.S. business and look at the consumer feedback metrics that you get, are you seeing anything in the consumer feedback that would suggest any issues related to brand or operational performance or anything of that nature? Thanks.", "Scott Maw", "Yeah, I'll start, David. And then, we will have Roz take the second half. So if you do math on at least the 3% for the full year, and we just did 2%, I think it gave you a pretty good idea of what we think by somewhat softer. We're not signaling that January had been off to a big negative breath. That is not what we're signaling. All we're signaling is a little bit softer estimate for Q2, so you can kind of do the math and figure out.", "We didn't put a number on it. But I think it's pretty clear about where we think we'll land. Roz, you want to cover the customer piece?", "Rosalind Brewer", "Yeah, so concerning the customer piece, I will say that we've been really looking carefully at this afternoon daypart and the customer that visits our stores during that timeframe. And we're learning a lot about them. But I can tell you that, they're confident about our brand. They still are committed to Starbucks.", "We are making sure that we are ready for the customer, the afternoon dayparts by looking at our routine efforts in the stores and to make sure that we've got the right partners in front of them. So we feel good about the customer and their connection to us. And we'll continue to make sure that they stay aligned with who we are as a company.", "Howard Schultz", "And, Kevin, can just add one thing about the equity of the brand? Could you hear me? This is Howard.", "Kevin Johnson", "Yes, yeah. Please, Howard, yeah, go ahead.", "Howard Schultz", "Just in terms of the equity of the brand, just in recent weeks two things came out that I think demonstrate and reaffirm the strength, the trust and the confidence in terms of Starbucks as a brand and a trusted company. Fortune survey came out and Starbucks was the fifth - fourth, I'm sorry, fourth most admired company in the world. And then we have a constant effort year in and year out to make sure that we are as relevant as possible with young people.", "And what came out is that Starbucks relevancy among teams is number one in any food and beverage retail brand in America. So I think, in terms of the equity of the brand, there's no issue whatsoever. This is a daypart challenge in the afternoon. And just like we figured out and cracked the code in the morning daypart, we will do the same thing in the afternoon.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Your line is open.", "Sharon Zackfia", "Hi, good afternoon. I guess a question on the digital side. I think, last quarter you provided us with what the comps were for the Starbucks Rewards spend versus the more occasional customers. I was wondering if you might provide that again. And as it relates to kind of broaden in the digital ecosystem, I mean when can we kind of expect more information from you? And are there thoughts about enabling some sort of a Starbucks Rewards program, where you don't have to have a preloaded card?", "Matthew Ryan", "Thank you for the question. Matt Ryan here Sharon. First of all, as is obvious in the numbers, virtually all our comp this past quarter came from our digital customers. And we saw a significant growth in the number of members, up 11% or so year on year, as well as healthy growth in member spend. So we're very, very pleased with what we saw. We've leaned into customer acquisition results.", "During this coming quarter, you're going to see some significant new initiatives added on, which have both short term and long-term potential benefits. We are going to be targeting, not just the Starbucks Rewards customers, but all customers with ways for them to sign up and engaged with us directly. That will create a new pool of customers that we can use our marketing capabilities to reach and talk to, and build a business from.", "You'll see that emerge across the course of the quarter, especially in March. And you'll see us begin to then have a greater pool of people with whom - from whom we can recruit future Starbucks Rewards members as well too. There are a number of different things teed up, not just for this quarter, but across the next year, that includes some of what you've been alluding to. And you can expect us to continue to make digital the focus of all of our marketing efforts moving forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "John Glass", "Thanks very much. Two if I could. First, just I'm still struggling with why the non-Rewards customer, the occasional customer is not coming as often. If you see, the brand is still strong and relevant, particularly young people, but they're not coming back. Is it as simple as the Frappuccino platform for example is getting tired?", "And if it is, what - how soon can you substitute products that really drive that afternoon business? Can you talk a little bit more about specific customer insight? I didn't think I heard that that in answer to a prior question.", "And on the guidance, I just want to make sure I understand you. You've kept your guidance the same. But I think you said margins are going to be below and comps are going to be at the lower end. So in this excluding taxes, what's the plug that still get you there if comps are at the low-end and margins are below?", "Kevin Johnson", "Yeah, John. This is Kevin, I'll take your question and I'll let Scott take the second one. When you think about our patterns, it's first of important to note that our core customer and especially in that morning daypart is very strong. And that's just reflective of the increased throughput at peak that we've driven. And I would say that the digital growth that we've seen, so core customers, morning daypart, daily ritual, throughput at peak strong. And that's beverage, food attach, strong.", "Number two, what we're calling the occasional customer, in some ways you could say are those non-Rewards customers or non-core, now the fact that we've grown active rewards by 11%, means we're attracting more and of the occasional customer into Rewards. So part of the reason you see that comp, you say, well, our occasional customers aren't growing. That's because a lot of them are joining rewards. And the more, we get them in that digital ecosystem, the best. Because now we can communicate directly with them, we can personalize offers that are contextually relevant to them. We can do so much more to create a great experience for those customers when we have digital combined with our brick and mortar experience.", "So the number three, say, okay, those customers who haven't joined Rewards, what's happening with occasional customers, now a lot we have a higher volume of occasional customers in the afternoon. And in many ways, you think about the morning daypart and a lot of that is really driving the need state of convenience as customers are getting their beverages and food on their way to work or school or some activity, what we find the afternoon is a customer occasion that's more the third place.", "And so in many ways, the opportunities we have to continue to enhance the experience in the third place drive innovation around food and beverage that resonates in the afternoon, and as Matt that the number one thing we can do is now connect with those occasional customers in a digital way. And so that's what we see happening and that is why the plans that we have are geared exactly to that. Roz, you want to touch upon sort of the plans that we have driving those three pillars.", "Rosalind Brewer", "Sure. So first of all, let me talk about in the first quarter, we added 1.4 million new active members and that really gives us an opportunity to do just what Matt mentioned is to bring them to the same level at our Starbucks Rewards customers that have been enjoying our business in the morning daypart. But second, we have very strong beverage innovation plan for the remaining part of the year. And I know, we've been talking to you about our beverage innovation for some time now, but we've been able to for the first time in a long time introduced a second espresso roast for the first time, our blonde introduction that just started in the month of January, we're excited about that.", "But second, we have a number of cold offering that we're introducing and some of them are accelerating into the second half of the year and I just remind you cold beverages are nearly 40% of total beverage sales and 50% of the overall growth that we're seeing right now is from our cold lineup. And that's up 230 basis points for our company. So the accelerating I think like our Nitro rollout, our Teavana teas, and our premiumized beverages. This is going to help us in the second half of the year, and these are items that have not existed in our product lineup.", "And when you align that with our food success, it really creates a package for us. And remember, our food represents right now 21% of our total revenues so we've got great moves in our beverage lineup, and the food attach that we've been seeing quarter-over-quarter will continue in the second half of the year.", "Scott Maw", "And then, John, your question on margin, I'll just quantify a little bit for you. We had slight margin expansion in our last guidance and now we're seeing a little bit of margin contractions we're not talking about it big dollars, but you're asking a fair question. There's two things. First of all, we did get a little bit more favorability than we had forecast below the line this quarter for some of the gift cart, unredeemed gift card true-ups that I talked about.", "And then that all of the net of the streamline activities are coming in a little bit more favorable than we originally thought, again both of those are relatively small amounts, but don't have a big impact, obviously on operating margin but allow us to hold our EPS guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "David Palmer", "Thanks. I heard in some previous answers you highlight the digital initiatives and you mention cold beverage innovation, just then. Are those the major factors that give you confidence in a back half acceleration that, it sounds like, it could be significant in your thinking or at least your banking on that perhaps you can give some sort of a ranking of what is giving you confidence in the back half acceleration? Thanks.", "Scott Maw", "Yeah, maybe - David maybe I'll start financially and I'll ask Matt, Roz to weigh in operationally, because obviously what we're mainly focused on talking about the U.S. business. But if you talk about the global business back half acceleration from a margin standpoint. It's the things that we're doing in the middle of the P&L around cost of goods sold around waste and around labor, we talked about those, that's the first thing.", "The second thing is acceleration of profitability as we bring East China into the fully wind down Teavana. We're a little bit more optimistic on how that's going to add to overall profitability. And then just to be specific, we expect the first half of the year in Americas comps to be a little bit below the average for the year, and the second half to be a little bit above. So I'm not [Technical Difficulty] in U.S. comps in our forecasting.", "We see that as a potential opportunity depending on how things land, but that's not what we're saying in that comp guidance we're giving, just to be clear. But maybe I'll turn it over to Matt to talk a little bit about the digital opportunities, first, and then Roz can cover up beyond that.", "Matthew Ryan", "Absolutely. So one of the things we see is, we see continued growth in the core Starbucks Rewards program, we've seen healthy growth in recent quarters and we have every indication of the investments we're making in technology that are sort of behind the scenes and less visible to you will continue to drive both acquisition as well as per member spend, so we're very confident in that.", "I think the more important it is, we're adding on a couple more major initiatives, so this quarter we will be launching with Chase and Visa, our first ever co-branded credit card and that will enhance the value of the program to many of our customers. The thing that I would like to highlight as well, is that we are also doing more to reach our non-Starbucks Rewards customer digitally and established digital relationships This includes making Mobile Order and Pay available at scale to all customers starting in March as well as deliberate initiatives, which you will see as the quarter unfolds, in which we actively sign up new customers with the special benefits and offers that will be meaningful and make a difference in our ability to market and personalized beyond just the core Starbucks Rewards members.", "Rosalind Brewer", "This is Roz. Let me just mention some of the things that we're doing from an operational improvement standpoint in the afternoon daypart, if you are recall about a year ago we introduced some labor deployment improvement at peak, and it's been successful for us. And for the first time, we're going to expand those through the full daypart and this includes some of the lessons that we've learned at peak from the routines and the labor deployment improvements that are really goes a little bit further than that.", "We're specifically looking at tasks that are performed in the afternoon, and we're looking at the experience level of our partners in the afternoon. Typically, we've used our afternoons to train our new partners, and to do routine tasks. And we often have a lot of our newer partners on staff doing their training.", "So over the coming weeks, we'll reevaluate how our staff will use these hours and use the stores and the partners against more customer facing initiatives, this will allow us to do really effective product introduction and then connect with the customer effectively. So we've learned a lot in that morning daypart and we're going to think it throughout the full day.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John Ivankoe", "Hi, two questions if I may. First for Roz, and the second for John, if I may. Roz, as you bring a broad perspective and focus now on the Americas business. Do you think some sort of a value strategy that fits within the overall lens as Starbucks becomes more important, as we can about 2018 and 2019 and maybe bring back some of that non-core customer. And how may you be thinking about communicating a price to the consumer? And a follow-up after this, if I may as well.", "Rosalind Brewer", "Actually I don't see a value position here, I actually think that our brand has the ability to speak even more at an up leveling. When we talk about product innovation, we talk about making our core coffee even better, when we talk about our Frappuccino business it's about making the very best Frappuccino. So a value position is not the direction we're looking at, we feel like our brand can go to the next level.", "John Ivankoe", "Okay. And thank you, John. I think, if you're on the phone. As we look at China, and you're obviously doubling down with the consolidation of East China, presumably margins of CAP become higher than that of the Americas, you know you have a lot of G&A and growth cost, unit inefficiencies, pre-opening, what have you in those numbers. But as you look out the next number of years, when might - firstly, will that happen? And when might that happen as we think about really the contribution from that division over the next couple of years?", "Scott Maw", "Maybe, John. This is Scott. I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to John to talk about why we think, we can drive outsized profit growth in CAP broadly in China specifically. So remember that our margin on that East China business today is probably in the triple-digit somewhere, because we have half of the profitability, but just a fraction of the revenue. So when you take that highly profitable business, and you do the new math with 100% ownership and that revenue denominator getting so much bigger, we'll see a little bit of impact at the CAP level on margins negatively, while we go through the first year.", "And again, that's not because profitability goes down, this John, but that because of just the straight math of owning 100%. Then I think, you're going to see CAP once again grow margins faster than any of the other businesses. And I do think over a number of years, we should see CAP catch, the Americas and perhaps overtake. And the reason - the big reason that is, and I'll turn it over to John is, because of the inherent profitability of CAP broadly. So markets like Korea, Japan doing well from a profitability standpoint, and of course, first and foremost the profitability within China. John, do you want to build on that?", "John Culver", "Yeah, just to build on that. As we integrate East China into the operations, we really are focused in three critical areas to - number one, get the business integrated, but more importantly make sure that we're in a position to accelerate growth, and at the same time expand the margins. So really looking at the operational efficiencies that we can gain with the acquisition and with the integration, particularly around supply chain, development and design, R&D, IT and a lot of the back-end infrastructure that currently exists in two different places, as we operated a joint venture and then we operated a company-owned business.", "And then, the last piece is around gaining synergy and leverage around scale. And in particular these areas are driving growth. Digital is a big opportunity, and if you look at digital and one voice to the customer across these markets, we see tremendous opportunity and runway for growth, just to put it into perspective. We now have six million active MSR members across China. We've introduced WeChat and Alibaba pay in our stores, and that is accounting to over 60% of the tender that's coming through the stores.", "Beyond digital, we've got beverage innovative and continued focus on accelerating the growth of beverage innovation through R&D that we've got on the ground, food, and then clearly, a big synergy around operations, and creating great customer experience across the entire portfolio. So to Scott's point there will be a period during the integration, where you'll see a moderate decline on margin, but we will gain that back and very confident of that.", "Scott Maw", "I just want to add one\u2026", "Howard Schultz", "Hey, John, this is Howard - I'm sorry. This is Howard. Can I just want add a little bit of context to China, and some of things you said. As Kevin said, I'm in Milan, and I'm working on the Milan Roastery with our design team, but on the heels of the record setting opening of our Shanghai Roastery, I just like to put it into context for you. I don't know how many store openings, I've been to and how many countries we've opened.", "But in my long, long history of Starbucks, I have never ever seen anything remotely like what happened, when we opened a Shanghai Roastery. I mean, we shattered every sales record in the history of the company, and I'm going to give you some numbers that we have not yet released, because I think it's very important as we look at the difference between 3% and 2% comps for the quarter. I think again, here's a number that I think you'll be very interested in.", "Our U.S. Starbucks stores on average do about $32,000 a week. The Roastery in Shanghai after eight weeks of operations is doing on average, twice that not each week, but each day. So the volumes that we are now hosting at the Shanghai Roastery is a number that we have never quite seen before, reaffirming the equity of the brand, reaffirming the interest our customers have in Princi, an opportunity that we feel is not only a domestic opportunity for standalone stores, but also an opportunity to leverage infrastructure and build Princi stores in China as well.", "But we just opened a store that is doing twice the amount per day that an average Starbucks is doing each week. That's the growth opportunity and that's the strength of the company in China. I think, we are at a disadvantage, because most of you have not seen our operations in China. I hope, you'll come to the event in May and you'll see something that there is no other Western brand, consumer brand that is accomplished with 3,100 plus stores, a store opening every day and numbers the likes of which we have never seen in our history.", "The Roastery in Milan will open in the fall, the Roastery in New York will follow, and then Tokyo and Chicago and all of this being integrated into the Princi stores that we feel so positive about it. So I just feel like it's really important to once again just put into context that we are a global enterprise, of course, the U.S. currently dwarfs the other aspects of our business.", "But what Kevin said is not a myth, it is true. China is going to be larger than Starbucks at the - in the U.S., China is going to have more impact and grow faster than anything we've done in our history. And what we have seen in Shanghai with the Roastery not only gives us confidence, but demonstrates the opportunity to be even larger than we once realized just a year ago.", "David Palmer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Bernstein", "Great. Thank you very much. Maybe just shifting gears for a second in terms of potential positive for the U.S. business or the Americas business. Just curious to get your theoretical thoughts on tax reform, and I know you guys and others have talked a lot about the corporate tax benefit, which seems significant. But in terms of the consumer benefit from tax reform, I was just hoping you maybe can give some insight in terms of historical or any kind of expectations you have, one, because the tailwind of a lower payroll tax, which is going to drive higher paychecks for the consumer and we're also seeing lots of corporates returning tax savings to employees by pay raises or the onetime stipends.", "I'm just wondering, what would you even compare that to historically, maybe people talk about the gas price savings even and how that was kind of a onetime benefit. But how do you think about, but what could be a benefit for Starbucks or for restaurants maybe relative to broader retailer in terms of the prioritization of that consumer spending?", "Kevin Johnson", "Yeah, Jeffrey, this is Kevin. Look, we haven't gone into some deep study of how much did this increase consumers discretionary spend, and we haven't factored any of that into the future view. I mean, logically you could draw a conclusion that increased discretionary income would increase spending on consumer items, including food and beverage, and that could be good for us. But being candid, we haven't studied that and I don't have any models or insights to share with you other than just general intuition, if consumers have more money, then that must be good for consumer spending.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.", "Matthew DiFrisco", "Thank you. I just had a one point of clarity I just want to see, and then also if you - just a question. Specifically to the $180 million to $220 million, Scott, I think you said that was - about half of that is going to come into 2018. So is that a - that's a run rate, so there will be a bigger weight on 2019?", "And then also the 2019 tax rate, I think you said, it was going to be 300 basis points higher or at least beyond 2018, the tax rate is going to be 300 basis points higher, is that correct?", "Scott Maw", "The first part is correct, Matthew. So 2018 will see a little less than half of that $180 million to 220 million run rate, and 2019 will see a little bit more. And part of that is, just because of the timing of some of the investments we'll make over the remaining course of the year.", "On the tax rate, the numbers I was quoting was trying to reconcile you from our GAAP tax rate to our non-GAAP tax rate. The thing to think about is, our non-GAAP tax rate will be about 26% in both years, so about 7 points lower than what we have guided at 33% before the change in the tax law. So that's a pretty consistent number as we look into the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is open.", "Karen Holthouse", "Hi, another question on the tax reinvestments. The language in the press release indicated that these were accelerating investments and you're part of the conversation for some time now has been built - talking about a multi-year cycle of investments that you're in. And when we're trying to bridge 2018 to 2019, should we sort of be layering in on top of this incremental spend, another $150 million or $200 million in partner investments? Or how did these just fit into sort of the original plan?", "Kevin Johnson", "Yeah, Karen, this is Kevin. Let me start and then I'll hand it out to Scott to add to this. But, clearly, when we looked at the tax reform and thought about the principles around this, the first principle we had is this doesn't change our strategy. Our strategies are strategy. We're clear on what we're doing. We're clear on the priorities we have. And so, just because the tax law changed, it does not alter our strategy. That was principle number one.", "Principle number two though was looking at the implications to Starbucks of that tax change and making a thoughtful decision around allocation of resources. The resource we could allocate to our existing strategy, that we thought would help us accelerate progress against it. And then how do we make sure - and so, and that principle was the second principle.", "The third was how we make sure we do this in a balanced way. Are we investing in the things that are creating shareholder value? And for the majority of this, it's going to drop to the bottom line and go straight to EPS. So when we put that together, the number one area you look at over the last several years has been an ongoing multi-year strategy is our investment in partners and digital. And the bulk of that investment has gone into partners around things like wage and benefits just knowing that certainly ads. You know.", "With unemployment low and with competing for the right kinds of talents, there's going to continue to be the need for us to invest in our partners. And we know in investing in our partners that we're able to attract the right people, and we're able to have a lower attrition and longer tenure than others in the industry, which helps us better connect with customers and help us drive sales. So we know that's a good investment to make.", "In addition, we know and have wider sight to the return on investment on certain digital projects. And so, that is the work we went through to determine what in the opportunity to make some additional investments in our partners, and some of the benefits in wage and to accelerate the progress on some of these digital projects that lead directly to the way that we know we can connect with customers and drive comp and drive revenue and profit.", "And so, that's kind of the principles and the construct that we came up with and I'll let Scott then take it from there in terms of the implications financially.", "Scott Maw", "I think, Karen, I think this is definitely\u2026", "Kevin Johnson", "Howard, go ahead.", "Howard Schultz", "Scott, I was just - I know it's difficult because I'm on a remote phone. But I'd like to just add something that I think is a strategic importance to the company long term if you don't mind.", "I think if you look at the history of our public life, one of the I think real benefits of what we've been able to accomplish as a company has been the entrepreneurial D.N.A. of Starbucks and constantly having the curiosity to see around corners and make big bets. And I think there's probably no better example of that than over the last five six years what we've been able to do, and what Matt and his team has been able to do around digital mobile payment.", "And our leadership position in what we've been able to accomplish as a brick-and-mortar digital mobile payment business. I'd like to just pose a question to all of you. And the question is, we all can probably remember 20 years ago or so, when someone tapped us on the shoulder and asked us anything about this thing called the Internet? And we probably all can remember that moment.", "Well, 20 years later or so, the world has been completely transformed. And we're all connected in ways that no one could have possibly ever imagined. And in terms of business and value creation there have been some huge winners, we all know that. From Facebook to Google to Amazon and many others, and there's been some companies that have not done as well, the Myspace of the world, Yahoo and others.", "Well, I think I have another question for you. 20 or so years later, and the question is, the issue of do you understand and are you anticipating what could happen with cryptocurrencies? And the reason I mention this is not because I'm talking about Bitcoin, because I don't believe that Bitcoin is going to be a currency today or in the future. I'm talking about the new technology of blockchain and the possibility of what could happen not in the near-term, but in a few years from now with a consumer application in which is trust and legitimacy with regard to a digital currency.", "Now, I'm not bringing this up because Starbucks is announcing that we are forming a digital currency or we're investing in this. I'm bringing this up, because as we think about the future of our company and the future of consumer behavior, I personally believe that there is going to be a one or a few legitimate trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology. And that legitimacy and trust in terms of its consumer application will have to be legitimatized by a brand and a brick and mortar environment, where the consumer has trust and confidence in the company that is providing the transaction.", "And then you have to ask yourself, well, if that's the case, if you believe that that proposition is possible, how many companies or what company has the national or global footprint as well as the digital mobile payment trust and confidence integrated into its existing business. And if you take it a step further, and you believe this is coming, given the fact that there are hundreds of millions of dollars domestically and globally being invested in this technology, in which there is an arms race as to who is going to win.", "There's going to be lot of winners, a lot of losers. But we are in a very unique position to take advantage of what other tech companies and the blockchain technology will provide in terms of the rails to potentially be in the mix of this and benefit financially, benefit in terms of consumer behavior and incrementality and significantly create long-term shareholder value.", "And I'm bringing this up, because three or four years ago I shared with you that I thought that we were heading into a seismic change of consumer behavior as a result of the Internet and e-commerce and the Amazon effect of things. And not that I was clairvoyant, and I wish I wasn't. But clearly, that has happened.", "I believe that we are heading into a new age, in which blockchain technology is going to provide a significant level of a digital currency that is going to have a consumer application. And I believe that Starbucks is in a unique position to take advantage of that. Now, I don't want anyone to hang up on this call and assume that we have this all figured out, because we don't. Or that we're making a significant investment in this, because we're not.", "But we are actively demonstrating the level of entrepreneurial curiosity and DNA of our company to do the things that we've done in the past to ensure the fact that we are at the cutting edge of this technology, of this consumer application. And we think we have something to offer the companies that are chasing this, because we are in a position to create the trusted legitimate place in which this could be accepted and possibly take advantage of the mobile payment digital platform that we have created.", "The one thing I would ask you not to do is ask Scott lots of questions about this, because this is not something that's in our model. But I think it's important as we - as you think about Starbucks and you focus on our company, you understand that the growth of our company and everything we've been able to do for almost 50 years is not based on monthly comps or quarterly comps. It's about the long view about the entrepreneurial DNA of the company, and constantly, constantly rejecting the status quo and doing everything we can to push for self-renewal, reinvention and really do everything we can to create the kind of relevancy with our customers, not only on what we sell and the experience we provide, but ensuring the fact that we are at the cutting edge of technology as we were in the last five years with the digital payment platform and the Rewards program. I'll leave it there.", "Kevin Johnson", "Thanks, Howard. Scott, you want to - the second part of Karen's question was on the investments that we were making. Yeah.", "Scott Maw", "Yeah, I think, Karen, the way to think about that is, as Kevin says, these were all on our roadmap. But I wouldn't think that, that this place is a partner investment in 2019. Or said more clearly, we're doubling down a little bit this year with partner investments, because it's the right thing to do. As we get into 2019, I assume we'll make additional partner investments and we'll come back to you on the size and scale of that. But this wouldn't be in replacement of that, which I think is the nature of your question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason West with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Jason West", "Yeah, thanks. Just two quick ones. I guess, one, in the past you guys have talked about how much of the spend or what the spend growth was for your MSR members, and if you could provide that for the quarter?", "And then just to clarify the timing of the rollout of offering mobile ordering to the non-MSR, is that something that is going to be nationwide coming up here in the spring or is it going to be rolled out gradually, starting at that point? Thanks.", "Kevin Johnson", "I'll cover the first part, Jason, and I'll turn it over to Matt. So we saw mid-single-digit kind of growth in spend per member, so another really good quarter off the back of two big quarters. So we're pretty happy with what we've seen, particularly given the members, member growth we had in absolute numbers. Matt, you want to cover the second part?", "Matthew Ryan", "Sure, we're actually in pilot right now in the marketplace. So we are offering mobile order and pay to many customers. You can call it guess checkout if you will to many people who do not have a stored value card. What will happen by the time we reach the end of March is we'll be able to scale that nationwide and make that available to all customers who are using our app.", "Operator", "The last question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Nicole Miller Regan", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Just two quick ones, both on China. As you look at the brand identity there and the unit growth, are you seeing achievements from landlords and stable rents in that regard?", "And then the second part is around the CPG business, so when you look at I guess China, also look at Japan and places that - I think you're growing the international CPG product rollout. Is there a U.S. model, you want the stores first or not as a model or now it is a model switch, where you have enough stores and you have the Shanghai Roastery that can go full fetched forward with that and that's something that also aids in brand awareness? Thanks.", "John Culver", "Yeah, Nicole. This is John. Real quick on the China piece. We are seeing continued very strong growth as it relates to our stores and really the elevation of the Roastery and the opening of the Roastery, we have landlords coming from all over China to see that. And they are reaching out to us, asking us to bring beautifully designed stores into their development.", "So we see tremendous opportunity to continue to accelerate the growth of new stores. Our new store performance is the strongest that is ever been. We opened up 188 new stores in the quarter. We now operate 3,100, over 3,100 stores across the Mainland. And we're going to continue to accelerate the growth. And we'll share more about that on our call next week with you.", "And then in terms of the channel development business and how we're thinking about growing channel development in these developing markets and in particular in China, as Scott shared, we sold 30 million bottles of Frappuccino since we introduced our partnership with Tingyi. Clearly, we have a strong retail brand footprint. But that retail brand is now extending out into the channels business, and then to retailers as well as into the digital space as well.", "And we're seeing that play out not only in China. We're seeing that in Japan, and then obviously, strong growth coming out of our channel development business in EMEA. So we're excited to grow that business in parallel with our retail footprint.", "Scott Maw", "So just - I'd add to John's point and maybe reflect back to a question that John Ivankoe asked about the growth of CAP.", "And just remember, in 2017, we saw China/Asia Pacific add nearly 50% of our overall operating income growth. As we think about this year, we'll probably be in that same range. Maybe not quite as much, because the Americas business is going to contribute a little bit more. But this is the twin engines of growth that Kevin talked about so specifically in his comments.", "And as we look forward to 2019 and we get into the full ownership of East China, I think you're going to see that same kind of mix to the overall operating income growth. That's obviously driven by China, but within China/Asia Pacific, the other pieces of Japan and Korea as well. So just make sure you remember this, that we're seeing a strong blend of profitability across those two businesses.", "Operator", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Shaw for his closing remarks.", "Tom Shaw", "Great. Thanks. Before closing today's call, we wanted to provide an update on the timing of several upcoming events. As mentioned in our earnings release today, we will host a supplemental call to discuss our business in China, as well as implications from modeling standpoint next Wednesday, January 31 at 2:00 PM Pacific.", "In addition, we want to provide the specific dates of our China investor tour that Howard mentioned. We plan to host management meetings, local store tours, and a visit to the Roastery in Shanghai on May 16, with plans to visit a second market the following day on May 17.", "And finally, we are timidly planning our 2018 Investor Day in New York on Wednesday, December 12. Thanks again. And have a great evening.", "Operator", "This concludes Starbucks Coffee Company's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call.
