This call is being recorded. Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President, Investor Relations at Range Resources. Please go ahead.", "Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining Range's first quarter earnings call. The speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Chief Financial Officer.", "Hopefully you've had the chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we've posted on our website. We'll be referencing some of the those slides this morning. We also filed our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.", "Before we begin, let me also point out that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. In addition, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. The supplemental tables also provide calculated natural gas differentials for the upcoming quarter and detailed hedging information for all products.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, Laith. Improving pricing differentials driving expanding margins is the theme of the first quarter and what we believe will be a continuing theme for Range in 2017 and 2018. Coupling the enhanced margins with the lowest PUD development cost for any of our oil or gas peers, we calculate our unhedged recycle ratio as approximately 3 times.", "The story is ratified by independent work from well respected firms and analysts, with one such report included in our new presentation. It examines recycle ratios across the Delaware Basin, Midland Basin, the SCOOP/STACK play, the Bakken, the Eagle Ford and the Marcellus. This work includes a number of very high quality oil and gas companies. Based on this analysis, Range has one of the top recycle ratios of any company whether oil or gas and in any basin. We believe this is a key indicator of long-term success driving above average profitability in a normalized price environment or strengthened stability in the down cycle.", "Moving back to margin expansion, improving price differentials for natural gas, NGLs and condensate are expected for 2017. A full year of transportation on our Gulf Expansion Phase 1 pipeline project and a full year of contribution from our near to market North Louisiana assets are resulting in our natural gas differential for this year improving to approximately NYMEX less $0.30. Later this year, we're expecting Rayne/Leach Xpress at their Southwest and Rover Phase 2 pipelines to commence operations. These transportation projects should result in further improvement in our 2018 differentials.", "Per barrel NGL pricing for 2017 is projected to be 28% to 30% of WTI. A full year of Mariner East plus NGL sales from North Louisiana are the main contributors for the increase in realized price. Looking forward to 2018, fundamentals suggest that higher demand for ethane and propane from the petrochemical sector and exports can improve our pricing differentials further next year.", "Our condensate pricing differential per barrel for 2017 is projected to be WTI less about $5.50. This is driven by a full year of our new marketing agreement for Marcellus condensate and a full year of North Louisiana condensate sales. Importantly, this pricing differential represent a 40% improvement over our 2016 condensate differential. This improvement in pricing across gas, NGLs and condensate coupled with one of the lowest cost structures in the industry, has resulted in the margin improvement we're seeing in the first quarter and are projecting for the full year. Capital efficiency in 2017 will continue to improve as we're targeting over 9,000 foot laterals in Pennsylvania and we're driving down the cost of drilling complete wells in North Louisiana. Ray will discuss our operational highlights next and provide more detail on our plans.", "With the first quarter in the books, 2017 is shaping up to be a good year for Range. Importantly, we expect our class-leading recycle ratio in 2017 to continue into 2018 and beyond as Range is one of the few companies in the industry with a decade plus of high quality drilling locations. We have a resource potential of approximately 100 Tcfe as compared to our year-end proved reserves of 12.1 Tcfe. Our resource potential does not include the highly prospective Utica, which will drive our ratio of resource potential to proved reserves even higher.", "As shown on slides 23 and 24, in the southwest portion of the Marcellus, Range has the highest estimated ultimate recovery per foot, lowest finding and development costs and lowest breakeven costs. We have a high quality asset position in North Louisiana and as shown on slide 13, we've made significant progress adding value since the acquisition was announced last May. Looking forward, Range remains well positioned to drive value for years to come.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff. Production for the first quarter came in at 1.93 Bcf equivalent per day, and guidance for the second quarter is flat to the first quarter of 2017, or 1.93 Bcf equivalent per day, and we remain on track for annual growth of 33% to 35% as the company's production growth is weighted towards the back half of the year.", "Before walking through operations, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our production growth for the rest of 2017 and how this sets us up for 2018. In Appalachia, we brought to sales in the first quarter less than 20% of our expected wells for the year, so growth in the back half of the year should look really good. In North Louisiana, we expect to bring to sales 29 additional wells in the second half of 2017, also providing solid growth in the second half of the year. We delivered on our expected production for the first quarter of 2017 in both Appalachia and North Louisiana.", "And in Terryville, we expect wells going forward will generate better growth than the group of wells turned to sales in the first quarter. To illustrate, let's compare and contrast our first quarter activity with our expectations going forward. As discussed on the last couple earnings calls, 18 of the Terryville wells brought to sales in the first quarter were drilled prior to the acquisition, many of them over a year ago. As result of completing such a large swath of wells at one time, which was 27 during the first quarter, and because of the location of many of these wells, approximately 40 million cubic feet equivalent per day of offset production was shut in to minimize the frac hits.", "The shut-in production does not come back all at once, but will come back throughout the year via flatter declines. Going forward, we're planning a more balanced approach both in terms of activity and planning the well locations to help minimize the impact on offset production. As discussed before, we've implemented a completely different flow-back in early production protocol. The wells will now be opened up under designed, constrained conditions, allowing the use of more cost effective facilities and the minimization of expensive flow-back rental equipment. We believe this will improve the overall project returns.", "What it means is, that we won't see the initial 30-day rates that you would have seen in the past. And we've changed production operations in the field. In addition to a different approach to flow-backs, we're also implementing Range's safety, facility and production protocols. One example is eliminating production of the annulus. This practice, while common in some areas, is not the preferred practice with the equipment that is currently in place. These design and operational changes resulted in cutting back production by approximately 30 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the year. Of course, this simply curtails production, and we expect to get that production back via a flatter decline.", "In the first quarter, we also tested some meaningful step-outs in Terryville that will help to further delineate and de-risk our well inventory. Some of these wells were in areas perceived as the edges of the field due to poor historical results. While the results from the new wells are early, they are very encouraging and are in part the result of improved targeting. With lower drilling and completion costs, the encouraging early well results and the ability in the future to incorporate better mapping and seismic, we believe these areas hold significant potential.", "As part of that same process of better understanding the field's ultimate potential, the first quarter included wells that had been drilled pre-acquisition in some of the Pink horizons. Completing these wells will provide us a better understanding of the resource potential over the coming years.", "Going forward, we'll continue to be focused on the Upper and Lower Red, while occasionally drilling other horizons and extension wells to optimize our full development plans. This is similar to our approach in Appalachia, that is, focusing on the Marcellus while unlocking the Utica and Upper Devonian opportunities over time.", "So while the first quarter was a great quarter operationally and financially, we're really looking forward to the second half of this year, as we continue to build on our operational successes in both North Louisiana and Appalachia.", "Hitting on some of the operational highlights for the quarter, we'll start with Appalachia, where we're directing approximately two thirds of our capital spend. We continue to make great strides in unit cost reductions, improving well performance and capital efficiency.", "I'd like to take a few minutes now and walk through some updates on the drilling side in Appalachia. Our team has now drilled the longest Marcellus lateral in Pennsylvania and three of the top four longest laterals in the entire basin. In the first quarter, we drilled three laterals over 15,000 feet and seven laterals over 10,000 feet. We're achieving a 67% increase in daily lateral footage drilled versus a year ago.", "Combining our drilling performance and planning efforts, our average lateral length drilled this year will be approximately 9,000 feet. These improvements can be attributed to four things. We've upgraded our rig fleet to higher horsepower and higher pressure rated equipment. We've adopted and greatly improved the efficiency of our rotary steerable tools. The team has redesigned our current mud systems, and a real focus on key performance indicators that trigger real and measurable success. And two final things on the drilling side, we've accomplished all of this while narrowing our lateral target to a 10-foot window, at the same time drilling faster while lowering cost from last year on a per foot basis by over 30%. And it's been almost two years since the team has had to sidetrack a wellbore. Needless to say, we're really proud of their accomplishments.", "On the completions, facilities, water and production front, we're continuing to innovate and improve efficiencies and cost. We're fine tuning frac designs and zipper frac operations, and I expect we'll continue to do so for years ahead. Even with some forecasted pressure on service costs, our cost per stage and our cost per foot of completed lateral should continue to improve throughout 2017.", "Facility costs should continue to improve and LOE continues to trend in the right direction. Any way you look at the data, Range has the lowest well cost, including facilities, of any operator in the southwest portion of the basin, and we expect those costs will continue to improve. One significant and unique advantage that we have is the extensive network of existing infrastructure in pads. We're planning for approximately a third of our 2017 wells on existing pads, with as much as half of our wells in 2018. This will drive down our costs significantly, by as much as $200,000 to $500,000 per well.", "On the well performance side, we continue to improve completion designs and see impressive results. As an example, I want to highlight a couple of liquids-rich pads that we brought online during the first quarter. In the wet area, we brought online a three-well pad with average lateral length of 7,186 feet, completed with 37 stages per well that produced net-to-sales under designed constrained conditions at a max 24-hour rate of 35.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well.", "In the super-rich area, we have a four-well pad with average lateral lengths of 10,772 feet completed with 54 stages per well, but have only been able to put two of the wells to sales so far. The reason why is that they're some of the best liquids rich wells in the basin. Those two wells have averaged over 31.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day, each well, or over 62.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day combined with 69% liquids, again under designed constrained conditions net-to-sales for a max 24-hour rate.", "As those two wells decline, we'll be adding the other two wells to sales as capacity frees up in the system. It's important to point out that this pad is near the planned Harmon Creek processing plant in a lightly drilled super-rich area. And we have plans to develop additional wells and pads in this area going forward.", "Clearly, these two pads illustrate the quality of our low risk, long lateral inventory in Appalachia in the dry, wet and super-rich areas. These types of results, when combined with going back on to existing pads with existing gathering and compression infrastructure generate liquids-rich drilling economics that are among the best in the business. Like I've said in the past, we literally have thousands of these types of opportunities and I still don't believe we've drilled our best well yet.", "As a quick update on the Utica, I believe it's worth pointing out the updated map in our presentation on page 44. Of particular note, we've highlighted the recent activity, including some direct offsets to our acreage currently being drilled that will clearly enhance our 400,000 net acre position further.", "We'll continue to monitor those wells and other Utica activity in Pennsylvania as we go forward. Our best well remains as one of the top four Utica wells in the play. We believe it will hold flat for close to 400 days and the EUR looks to be around 3.25 Bcf per 1,000 foot. Again, essentially all our acreage is HBP'd and we believe the Utica play will play a complementary and important role in the future.", "Shifting to North Louisiana, we're excited about the progress we've achieved in just a little over six months and believe we're on track to exceed our original acquisition expectations. We're in line with forecasted production and cash cost, and we're expecting solid growth in the second half of the year, while drilling and completion cost have improved further and faster than we expected. We've reduced our average all-in well cost for a 7,500 foot lateral by another $300,000 to $7.4 million while reducing drilling time, refining the target window and staying 100% in zone.", "This is now $1.3 million or 15% below the $8.7 million cost last September, which obviously has a major impact on the economics. Like we've discussed, this lower cost will open up additional inventory from various horizons across our acreage positions. Our capital plan and the $7.4 million well cost in North Louisiana has baked in our forecast for service pricing increases for the year. For some services, those increases could range from 5% to 25%. However, as evidenced by our well cost, we fully expect that improvements in our operations and designs will more than offset the service price increases.", "As mentioned earlier, our 2017 North Louisiana program includes drilling, delineating and de-risking our well inventory in Terryville. This plan consists of wells in the various Lower Cotton Valley intervals that will lead to an improved understanding and mapping of the reservoirs alongside the acquisition of additional science work directed at determining optimum targeting and completion design. We are acquiring additional seismic along the southwestern and southeastern portions of the field to help calibrate the reservoir mapping and well results.", "During the quarter, we completed 27 wells made up of 19 Upper Reds, five Lower Reds and three Pinks. And we're producing these wells much differently than the historical practice, mainly under designed facility constraints, resulting in lower cost and flatter declines. We believe that this new approach of adopting more cost effective facilities, combined with better targeting and completions will drive the next step in development for the Terryville field.", "To put some context around 2017 well activity, there are really three groups of wells. The first group is the wells that we simply call the pre-Range wells. In essence, we may have taken over operations in one phase or another, but essentially they were planned and designed using historical practices. This was 21 of the 27 wells in the first quarter, and 18 of them were drilled almost a year ago.", "The second group of wells, which six of the 27 fall into this group, is those wells where Range may not have been able to pick the location or the formation, but we did have some influence in the targeting and drilling of the well. And then the last group are the Range wells, where we picked the location, formation, target and designed them from start to finish. The majority of the remaining 29 wells for the year, again which are weighted to the last half of the year, fall into this group and we've only recently begun completing the first of these wells. We're excited about what we see so far, and I look forward to updating those results throughout the year as we gather that performance data and build our reservoir models and development plans for the future.", "As an update on the extension area activity, results continue to be encouraging from the two of the wells that we announced last quarter. Each of the two wells, each located in separate Terryville sized fault blocks, one to the east, and one to the west of the Vernon Field have cumulative production to-date of approximately 1 Bcf each. As a result, plans are underway to offset each well with another horizontal well.", "Additionally, in the extension area, we have two pilot holes, one partially completed lateral that we're currently testing and we'll be starting a couple of new vertical wells designed to test multiple targets on an individual basis. This allows us to determine reservoir and rock properties while performing specific diagnostics to identify the best lateral targets. With over 400 Bcf per square mile and up to six target intervals, the potential is large. Again, we remain focused on Terryville while methodically testing and delineating the extension areas over time.", "In the Marcellus, we're continuing to improve returns through lower cost and improved well performance and we continue to develop our extensive inventory of core locations with longer laterals. In North Louisiana, we're ahead of our acquisition case and believe we'll continue to make progress going forward. We're on track for our production growth guidance for 2017 and 2018 is shaping up very well.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials.", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, Ray. The first quarter of 2017 builds upon the excellent fourth quarter of 2016 with further improvements in top line growth, cost control, margins and bottom line net income and cash flow. Net income on a GAAP basis for the first quarter was $170 million, while earnings using common analyst methodology, which excludes non-cash derivative mark-to-market entries and non-recurring items was $61 million.", "Cash flow for the first quarter was $258 million, 2.5 times the first quarter of last year's $99 million figure. Cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.05, 78% higher than last year's per share figure of $0.59. EBITDAX for the first quarter of 2017 was $303 million, compared to last year's $135 million amount. First quarter 2017 cash margin, at $1.47 per Mcfe, was almost double that of last year's cash margin at $0.77.", "One notable achievement in the first quarter of 2017 was that for the first time since 2014, Range was solidly profitable without any contribution from our hedge book, with our unhedged recycle ratio approaching 3 times and continued margin and capital efficiency improvements projected, future quarters should be much more like the past two quarters than the preceding seven.", "Moving to the expense performance for the first quarter, all of our expense results came in at or below guidance. Detailed expense guidance for the second quarter of this year may be found in the earnings release.", "Turning to the balance sheet, like last year, we ended the first quarter with less debt than we entered as our spending outflows were less than our cash inflows. Our debt-to-EBITDAX leverage ratio, calculated using a first quarter annualized EBITDAX, was 3.1 times and our book debt-to-capitalization ratio is 40%.", "Additional hedges were selectively added during the first quarter to be already well established 2017 and 2018 hedge positions and we initiated our first hedge on 2019 production. Presently, over 75% of our 2017 natural gas production is hedged with an average floor price of $3.22 an Mmbtu. Additional hedges were added to our oil and NGL book during the first quarter as well. Full disclosure of our hedge price and volume positions maybe found in the 10-Q, earnings release and Range website.", "The first quarter of each year has historically been a strong one financially. The reason for this first quarter strength is usually the peak of winter weather and the resulting strong demand and higher prices for our products. In 2017, the story is very different. This winter we experienced the second warmest first quarter in 30 years, based on gas weighted heating degree days, and the second warmest first quarter in 123 years based on average temperature.", "However, our first quarter cash flow of $258 million was roughly the same as our cash flow for the first quarter of 2014, a year when we had the coldest first quarter in 30 years. The reason that our first quarter financial performance in the second warmest winter in 30 years is on par with the coldest winter in 30 years is a result of capital-efficient growth and the improved transportation, marketing and cost control measures Range has been working on for the past 10 years. The margin improvements we are seeing from our relentless cost control, the capital efficiencies from technology and the quality of our rock, combined with the marketing uplift from our unique natural gas and NGL marketing projects, have made Range's financial performance much more durable regardless of the weather.", "Now Jeff, back to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Ventura. Your first question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.", "Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you folks. Good morning. Touching on differentials here, a big theme no doubt, and maybe picking up where Roger left off in his prepared remarks. How much of the improvement in differentials in your mind is unique to the company based on moves made in pricing molecules outside the Appalachian Basin say versus how much is based on developments general to the industry? Asking here in an effort to get a better sense of really what's sustainable.", "Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah Dan, this is Laith. I think it really gets back to the approach that we've taken with marketing to move our molecules and have the flexibility of having production in-basin as well as moving gas to the Gulf Coast, the Midwest, and the Southeast. So in the first quarter, you'll notice that we came out with a positive $0.01 differential. So, despite having the warmest winter in the last 130 years like Roger mentioned, we still have some of the capacity that gets us to premium markets despite having no winter. And as we move towards the end of 2017, with some of the transport that we have coming online, you'll have 90% of our gas being sold to markets better than what we're typically seeing in Appalachia.", "Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Great. Thank you. And just as a follow-up to that, just addressing the Terryville cost reduction, what's behind the cost reductions to-date? And what drives the reductions going forward here? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much the company's scale explains the improved capital efficiency in the field versus simply cutting fat that was in the prior operator's system, if you will.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, Dan. This is Ray. And that's a great question. And last quarter, we went through a whole litany of examples where they had increased drilling time, employed new downhole mud motors, more aggressive bit designs. We essentially changed out the drilling team. We brought in a gentleman that, Scott Chesebro, who is extremely talented and knows as much about high pressure, high temperature drilling as anybody, around and so he has really reshaped our whole program there. We've recently for example drilled a curve in one of these wells in 24 hours, and the average last year was 86 hours.", "So it's just a continual litany of things like that that we've been able to do. We went from, in the series of wells that we fracked in the first quarter we had planned, because in the past they had averaged about eight stages a day or a little bit less, and so we planned for about eight and ended up averaging 12 to 15 stages a day.", "So I think it's been a lot of that. It's been a lot of using Range's purchasing power, just simply because of the size and scale that we bring to the table. And then I think as we go forward with a more balanced approach and we kind of smooth out the activity levels and we plan where the wells are a little bit better, as we go forward we won't go through these very variable up and down cycles of activity levels going forward. And I think that will help improve cost as we go forward.", "Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "I appreciate the answers. Have a great day. Thank you.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Holly Stewart with Scotia Howard Weil.", "Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Good morning.", "Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil", "First, maybe Ray, you gave a lot of detail on Terryville and the well results during the quarter, which I think explains the production that we saw in 1Q. But given these dynamics and the fact that you got 29 more wells which are all Range designs, can you maybe help us think through the volume for Terryville for the rest of the year and maybe how that sequential progression goes throughout the quarters?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Sure, Holly. And basically the high level answer is the next 29 wells are going to be a lot better than the first 27. And of course to understand that, you have to compare and contrast a lot of that. And I went through in my remarks and talked about how 21 of the 27 wells were actually wells that were pre-Range. 18 of those were actually more than a year old. So in a lot of ways, we had very little influence on how those wells were picked, where they were, what they were targeted in and so forth.", "And then six of the remaining wells, which was the full group of 27, were wells that we took over in one phase or another. We didn't get to pick where they were, but we may have been able to refine the target or different phases \u2013 took over in different phases of operations. And some of those wells, we're testing other horizons and different things like that. So we're learning a lot. We've changed a lot of production facility. We've changed a lot of the early flow-back procedures. We're really focused on project returns instead of just 30-day IPs.", "I don't think the previous operator did anything wrong. I think it was just different, and I think we've got a much different approach and as we implement that approach, I think what we've done in these first six or seven months that we've had it under our belt, which again is not very long, but I'm real proud of what the team's accomplished and I think you'll begin to see the results of that going forward. We've shot a lot of 3D seismic. We've done a lot more mapping. We're starting to build reservoir models and we'll be able to place a lot of wells in some of the areas where we've seen really good results. And I think, bottom line, the next group of wells will be a lot better, and that's part of how we get there for the production growth for the year.", "Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil", "Okay. Perfect. But any attempt to sort of break down Terryville versus Appalachia in that growth number?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Appalachia is \u2013 we only had about 20% of the wells to come online this year. I think I would attribute some of the changes in Appalachia to \u2013 a lot of it is timing, a lot of it is the team is making really great progress in drilling longer laterals. And you're going to start seeing some of the wells that we've talked about being on existing pads start to domino in the last half of the year. And as we've ramped up activity with the new budget and everything that started in January, a lot of that activity starts domino-ing six to nine to 12 months later, depending on if it's an existing pad or whatnot.", "So, essentially we're getting really solid growth from both areas. In Appalachia, there's just a lot of timing that's going to come forward in the second half of the year. I'm really, really excited about some of the recent stuff we've done because since we've now HBP'd our acreage, one of the things that the team has really focused on is some of the very, very best areas. And the two examples I gave in my prepared remarks are certainly extremely impressive. I mean, those are some of the best economics out there, dry, wet, or super-rich.", "But there were three more pads that I could have talked about that were 25 million, 26 million, 16 million a day equivalent type constrained rate conditions again. Which I think as you see us do more of that, focus in great areas, long laterals, existing pads, we're going to see really strong growth in the second half of the year out of Appalachia, just like we're going to see I think stronger growth out of North Louisiana. And we're really still solid on our production annual growth targets.", "Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil", "Yeah. Okay. Well, maybe switching gears to Appalachian for the follow up, you mentioned a lot of infrastructure constraints, adding the Harmon Creek plant, the downtime at Houston, and then the new gathering systems. Can you just maybe talk about the timing of these things and how it sort of impacts the near term volume?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "The MarkWest plant, it's something that \u2013 what they're doing there is the original cryogenic plant was about 30 million a day plant, and they are basically going to use that spot and put a new generation 200 million a day plant. So, again it's building a lot of infrastructure for our growth in the coming years. In order to do that, they have to take the whole plant down for day or two to reroute a bunch of power and do different things there. I won't get into too many details. Also part of that, the de-ethanizer will be down for about a week. And so while that will impact our second quarter some, it won't even be a blip in MarkWest's infrastructure. I mean they've gotten so huge now. So it's something we knew about, we forecasted. It's been built into our annual growth plans for some time. So, we're pretty pleased with that.", "The new wells up around the Harmon Creek, the future site for the Harmon Creek processing facility, we need to get up there and start drilling wells in preparation for that. We have some basic backbone of the infrastructure up there, but just like our position in southwest Pennsylvania is really, really large. We're far from having all the infrastructure built out, and so as we move to the north, and so forth, you're going to see us add more and more of that infrastructure in compressor stations, the restructure and compressor stations, the processing plants and so forth. And I think the exciting thing is is that could be potentially some of the best rock in the whole core up there. So we're pretty excited about that.", "Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil", "Great. Thanks guys.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Gentlemen, say, question first just guys, I looked, noticed about the \u2013 this is more about sort of allocation of activity in northern that, noticed that northern Marcellus, kind of the drop we've seen year-over-year and sequentially. Could you just talk about kind of rig allocation or activity allocation? Should we expect kind of similar? And I know now you're kind of blending the whole Appalachian together, but as we look particular to northern Marcellus, how should we think about that for the next remainder of the year?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, it's a good question, Neal. We did combine all the operations in Pennsylvania into our southern Marcellus division, or what was previously called that, and it's now we just refer to it as Appalachia. You're right in that we have over the last several years put less and less capital up there as the differentials have been really tough. It's good rock, it's just hard to sell the gas when you've got those kinds of discounts in place up there.", "So, we have put it all under one team. It will be much easier to allocate capital with that team up there. They'll put it in their whole mix of assets that they've got across Pennsylvania. I think that they're likely to find some new things. Any time to get a fresh set of eyes looking at project, they're likely to come up with new ideas and they'll put their grass roots plan together going forward and if it competes economically with the projects in southwest PA, then we'll fund it going forward. But at this point, they literally just took it over in the last month. So, I think it will be some time before we see anything happen up there. The good news is it's HBP'd, so we're not really rushed to do anything.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "No, great flexibility there. And then, Ray, just one follow-up, as far as looking at the level of the change that seems like, or encouraged I should say, about the changes in Terryville, when you look at kind of your new pressure management, how should we think about, you did mention, it's not a surprise that the IPs might be a little bit lower. But how should we think about sort of that cumulative production over, I don't know, either the first six, nine or 12 months as you sort of dial that in versus what the previous team had?", "Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, I think what we have \u2013 this is Alan, Neal. I think what we have in the appendix portion of the book, we have some type curves associated for both the Upper Red and Lower Red. And I think what you see in those forecasts is a lower initial rate coming through. And so we would expect to probably with the wells, with the 29 wells going forward that Ray talked about, that we've had our design and everything in there, we would expect those well performance to kind of look somewhat similar to that. I don't have the exact page. I think if you look at -", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "46, 47", "Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.", "47 and page 47 in the book kind of gives you an idea of what it would look like. Probably what we would see, is you probably won't be starting at that peak rate. You'd probably have to slide that out about 15 days or some for wells to kind of, for wells as they come on, they kind of increase productivity for a little bit. So I would expect it's going to look something similar to that, so a little bit lower rate overall. Similar for the Lower Red that's also in the book as well.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "But overall, Alan, your returns, I guess the way you now are position that, it certainly appears to me like on an EUR return basis, they are a bit better despite that initial little bit lower rate, correct?", "Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, I think that's fair to say.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "With the lower well costs.", "Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.", "With the lower well costs.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Great add. Thanks, guys. Good color.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Good morning, guys. Just one quick follow-up on Neal's question. Ray, is it safe to assume that part of the same or better economics despite the lower production rates is associated with the upfront costs? I think you mentioned facilities, gathering, flow-back equipment, how much is the cost savings associated with that flow-back to offset the lower initial production?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "That's a good question, Ron. We could get back to you with more exact numbers, but off the top of my head, when you're renting that expensive flow-back equipment for 30 to 60 days, it's several hundred thousand dollars, probably $0.5 million. It tops somewhere in that range. So you're saving a lot of money off the top up front.", "Also like much like we've learned and done in the Marcellus over the years, you learn to optimally size your production equipment and make it more generic in nature, so you can kind of stack it, move it around, reallocate it to new wells, pull it off wells that have fallen below that and so forth. So it allows us a lot of overall project flexibility going forward. The team is doing a lot of things on the LOE side. They're doing lot of things on the salt water disposal side.", "Again, we've only had it six or seven months, and gone through significant organizational changes. I think the teamwork is really coming to fruition, and you're already seeing, we've already lowered costs faster and further than we thought we would in our expectations. So, we're pretty excited about what we see. But again those well costs, we've cut a lot of the low hanging fruit, but I still think there is a lot of fine tuning that we're going do going forward over the next year. And again, we'll see I think begin to see a lot of that performance and economics really happen in the second half of this year.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Okay great, and then moving to my question, the super-rich pad that you brought on, you talked about that being in a more lightly drilled portion of Washington County. Why was that area more lightly drilled? Does that de-risk for, in years in industry minds that that portion of the acreage and has that flowed through to kind of the resource potential you thought that area may have?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. Well again, we have a really large position southwest Pennsylvania and we sort of started in the wet area around the Houston plant and you've sort of seen our development expand from that area over the years. We drilled years ago several wells up into the northwest portions of the field and got some early indications. We have full seismic coverage. We've got a lot of information on the field and these recent wells we've gone up there, they're 10,000 foot plus laterals. They're completed with 54 stages using all of the latest technology and we've made wells that are essentially 5,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The wells were making over 1,000 barrels a day of condensate apiece, each well.", "So I mean the bottom line is yeah, all that area is completely de-risked. And I think now, we're beginning to become more excited about drilling a whole bunch more 10,000, 15,000 foot laterals up there as we go forward, and it gives us a whole lot of confidence that helps us in sizing the infrastructure and things that are going to be developing over the years ahead. This was something that's been in our plan for many, many years going forward. It's just now really exciting to see it come to fruition and how good those extra long laterals are going to be up there.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Great. I appreciate the answers.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Subash Chandra with Guggenheim.", "Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Yeah, hi. I wanted to ask about your frac protect plan in Terryville. Do you expect these offset wells to return to their pre rates, to their prior rates? And could you give us a sense of was it a mile radius or so that you saw the frac interference and how many wells might have been impacted?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, that's a great question. We're still learning exactly how far these wells will impact offset wells, but generally speaking today, I think the thoughts are around 4,000 or 5,000 foot, so about a mile. I think that to answer first part of your question, yes, that production, those wells will eventually come back, some faster than others. And so, that's what I meant in my prepared remarks, while we shut in 40 million a day, while we had all that frac activity going on, some wells come on sooner than others and some come back to where they were sooner than others and there's just a huge variation in that. So I think as we go forward, when you take a much more balanced approach in the second half of the year, you will see wells where we planned that out better to try to mitigate and minimize the amount of impacts, so we don't have to shut in as much production and a lot of those things going forward.", "Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Could you comment on how many wells were shut in?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "I don't know off the top of my head. I guess that's something we could, you could follow with Laith and the guys and we could get an answer, but I just don't know that answer.", "Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Oh, sure, sure. And my follow-up is the Terryville well cost reductions, what was in the CapEx guide? Are you, it sounds like you're overachieving the CapEx guide for the year.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. I think we were probably a little higher than where we were today. Again, we achieved it faster and further than we thought. We're going to do what we always do. We're not going to change our stripes. We're going to use that capital to optimize the plan. There is still a lot of things we want to test. A lot of the southern edges of the field we want to test, the extension areas, it's going to allow us to do more science and diagnostics in that area, help us move that plan forward faster. So, I think that's a good thing in the long run for us.", "Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi.", "Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Good morning.", "Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Jeff, in your slide presentation, you highlight the three pipeline projects that are coming on in the second half of the year. Do you expect to, apart from an initial ramp-up period, fill your firm transportation capacity on those lines? And if so, is some of that moving gas from other existing lines to be more economic on these new lines, and still leaves you with some excess capacity in the system that you could fill if you continue to see better than expected well results?", "And separately from that, for the industry, we're not at the 100 rigs you've always talked about that the industry needs to fill the pipe capacity, but as we get to year-end, do you see all this pipe, apart from which you're going to do, being filled by the industry?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. Let me kind of work backwards through that. In order to fill all that capacity, current rig count in Appalachia is somewhere around 64, plus or minus. I'll quote one of our competitors, Rice said they believe I think it's 125 rigs that are needed now in order to have all that filled. We've actually done our own internal work and our number is right around their number. So we think the basin basically needs to almost double the rig count in order to fill the pipes and that needs to happen almost immediately because some of those pipes are going to come on by the end of the year. So we actually believe the pipes all won't fill and there will be excess capacity in the southwest part of the play.", "Of course, up in the north, far northeast part of the play, there is really no new pipe coming on this year and probably at the earliest, it's middle of 2018 or something for Atlantic Sunrise to come on up there. So one advantage of where we are in the southwest part of the play is better infrastructure, better takeaway, and it's a really important point. As those pipes come on, it will allow us to \u2013 to get to the first part of your question \u2013 to redirect some of our gas to better markets which should result in continuing to improve margins. A big part of the story this year that I think will extend into next year is margin improvement which translates into better cash flow, better cash flow per share, and coupled with that second half ramp, really helps us set up 2018.", "So I think when you look at the infrastructure, the other thing \u2013 and then if you look really forward, the team's done a good job of setting up a diverse portfolio of transportation. We got a huge position where we continue to grow volumes, and as we grow volumes, then we'll have optionality whether to move some of that gas out of basin, to sell some in basin, which will ultimately really drive down, if you look forward, our transportation costs.", "Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "So I guess there, I guess part of my question, the corollary is that \u2013 your guidance really isn't dictated by the available pipe capacity, that it could move up given that there could be excess capacity from where you're diverting gas of existing lines.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "There will be that optionality. A big part of that will be cash flow. Our spending for next year will be a function of cash flow or \u2013 at or near cash flow. So, it depends on where you think gas prices are next year, but clearly we have the inventory and ability to grow and move gas. But we'll be somewhat disciplined. We'll be disciplined in order to be at or near cash flow.", "Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then my follow-up for Ray, real quick is, Ray, you mentioned in the press release, you're drilling the two further extension wells to offset the two Terryville wells to the east and west of the Vernon Field. And your press release shows a third extension well. Is that going to be targeting the area to the north that before you had the Lower Red well that came on at about 5 million a day, which was less than the other two? But is there activity to the north of the Vernon Field part of the plan this year, also to go back to that area and see if you can get some better results up there?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "We don't have anything going on right now to the north side of the Vernon Field. That third well is in a different fault block from in the first three that we've talked about. The east and the west ones are pretty encouraging. They both cumed about 1 Bcf each and so we're going to offset those two wells to the east and west. The north one, we haven't done a whole lot with and there is another fault block where that third well is, and we're right now doing a lot of testing on it. So, it's turned into more of a science well than anything at this point.", "And so we've kind of got that activity going, and then we've got another area where we're going to put a couple of vertical wells in and do some real serious core-ing and log analysis and micro-seismic imaging and a lot of different things in that area to try to optimize our reservoir models and figure out what the very best target is. I mean, the good news in several of those different fault blocks, and all of those fault blocks are Terryville size or larger, so the potential is really huge. But again, we're going to take our time methodically and strategically and test each one of those as we go forward. But all those fault blocks are different and they all have tons of gas in place, so that's the exciting part of it. We just want to make sure we've got really solid plans going forward.", "Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "In that third fault block that you're going to test, that's east, west, or where is that?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "I don't know that we've disclosed that yet. But I'm sure we'll be talking a lot more about it in the next call.", "Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Thank you. Good morning.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Good morning.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Just following up with regards to the extension wells in Northern Louisiana, you've gotten the 1 Bcfe per well over I think it's about 160 days. Can you just add some more color there and parse it with your type curve? What do you think that suggests so far regarding economics and opportunity? Obviously, you've talked to your next steps there.", "Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, Brian, this is Alan. We continue to plot those wells up against both the Upper and Lower Red, and they're producing kind of in line with what both those curves that are out there. That's kind of consistent with what we said on the last call when we disclosed the well results at that point in time. So, wells continue to produce similarly with what those type curves are. We're continuing to help understand where we are within the section, continue to gather a lot of data, and I think we're encouraged where we are to date to feel about going ahead and offsetting both those wells. We still like the fact that there is a tremendous amount of gas in place. There is multiple horizons out there, and of course, there is a lot of information we are continuing to glean from the production data as well as offset well performance from both vertical wells as well.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great, thanks. And then shifting to Appalachia, Range is historically very early in signing low-cost takeaway contracts to get gas out of the region. And recognizing that the wave of new pipelines are coming on now from what you contracted a couple years ago, wanted to get your view on the strategy for growth in the next decade and whether you think it makes economic sense to be thinking about contracting now or whether your flexibility to shift capital geographically means Range down the road will depend more on local market prices and Louisiana prices?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Brian, let me start and others can chime in. I think one thing, if you look at the next decade out, something that's I think not real well understood actually was part of internal work we've done, and I've heard other people talk about it a little bit, but not much, is the concept of sweet spot exhaustion. I think if you really look at core areas in Appalachia, but I think it's true in the Permian, the only two plays I think with more than a decade worth of true sweet spot drilling left is probably Permian and Appalachia.", "But when you look in Appalachia, there is only a couple of companies that have more than a decade worth of really high quality wells. Not that a lot of people won't claim that, but when you look at the data and you look at the EURs per thousand and cost per thousand.", "So I think again, I think there is only two plays that have more than a decade worth of true sweet spot drilling. A lot of the other plays will be exhausted quicker than that. So if you look in Appalachia, even early on, our thoughts were when you look at all these plays, infrastructure tends to get overbuilt with time. I mean that's true historically.", "We assumed that we would get what we thought was right-size transportation early on to allow us that flexibility to grow. So, I think given the position we're in, we're in great shape as we look forward. Again, we don't think the pipes fill early on, but particularly if you look out over the next decade, there will be that optionality probably to sell gas in-basin or we'll have the ability to probably move it out, whatever is more optimum. And with that, I think that will continue to drive down unit costs with time. Again the advantage we have is just a huge inventory of high quality prospects plus we have now the optionality of drilling in Northern Louisiana or in Appalachia. So I think we're well positioned for the future.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We're nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Blaise Angelico with IBERIA for our final question.", "Blaise Matthew Angelico - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC", "Yeah hey, good morning guys. Apologies if I missed this early on. But just was wondering if you could talk about what specifically you're going to be changing on the completion design on those Range controlled wells in North Louisiana versus what the prior operator was doing. And then in terms of that well that is completing, is that a second quarter or a third quarter call type of event where you release production rates?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. This is Ray. As far as completion designs, I don't want to get into too many details, but we're looking at stage spacing, the perforation cluster designs. As you can imagine, this is a sandstone. It's not a shale. There's a lot of differences involved here. We're still trying to optimize the targeting and figure out what makes sense to be. And we understand that being in the zone for 100% of the well is certainly, appears to me, making a good difference so far and we got some good examples of that.", "So I think that we're doing well on that. It's going to be looking at different fluids, different proppant mixes, different perforation designs and we're far from understanding what we believe the optimum is going to be going forward. We're still working on that issue in the Marcellus, and so I think we'll have a lot of that going forward. And then, the last part of your question, I've already drawn a blank on.", "Blaise Matthew Angelico - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC", "Yeah, it was just in terms of that Range controlled well.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Oh yeah, yeah.", "Blaise Matthew Angelico - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC", "That you're just completing, just kind of timing on the production rates on that.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, we only just started completing it literally a week or two ago. There is going to be a little bit of a lull of time period until the next group of wells that we start completing. So, assuming it comes online in the next month, then we would probably want to see \u2013 I'm looking at Alan here \u2013 but probably three months plus.", "Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.", "Right.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Of production history. Because again, we've got a completely different flow-back protocol and early production protocol, and so the well we know is going to be constrained a lot longer. So, I would think it's going to be at least probably the call after next before we'll have anything that we can talk about definitively as far as EUR per 1,000 feet or anything like that. I think we'll continue to improve costs, but I think it's just going to take us some time before we can tell you much about that.", "Blaise Matthew Angelico - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC", "Got you. Thanks. I appreciate the time, guys.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "You bet. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thanks to everyone for participating on the call.

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's fourth quarter earnings call. The speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Chief Financial Officer.", "Hope you've had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we've posted on our website. We'll be referencing some of the slides this morning. We also filed our 10-K with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.", "Before we begin, let me also point out that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. In addition, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of these non-GAAP measures and to provide more details on both natural gas and NGL pricing.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thanks, Laith. Before I discuss what we'll see for 2017, let me briefly review some accomplishments and results from the fourth quarter and 2016.", "The fourth quarter was our best quarter of the year, not only from a cash flow perspective but also because it was the first full quarter with our North Louisiana assets. The office integration has gone very well, and the team is making great operational strides, some of which we'll discuss this morning. Our unhedged margins for the quarter were the highest that we've seen since 2014, as operating expense and interest per Mcfe declined substantially, and pricing differentials improved by selling more of our products to better markets.", "Our reserve report for year-end 2016 also had a number of highlights that speak to the depth and quality of our inventory. Our F&D costs, however you like to slice them, were very competitive, with drill bit costs of only $0.34 per Mcfe. In addition, our resource potential now stands at over 100 Tcfe, with thousands of locations, providing us a tremendous runway for future investment.", "Looking towards 2017 and 2018, we're excited about what's happening at Range, as we have the ability to generate significant growth while spending at or near cash flow on the back of improved pricing differentials and margins. As it relates to pricing, we're projecting significantly better netback pricing for all three of our products: natural gas, NGLs, and condensate. In addition, we're expecting continued improvement in our cash costs. The net effect is that our margins are projected to show a substantial increase versus 2016. The significant improvement in margin, coupled with our very low development costs, results in one of the best recycle ratios in our business for either an oil company or a gas company.", "I'll take a minute to walk through the numbers. Beginning with netback pricing for natural gas. We're projecting a 33% improvement in our natural gas differentials for 2017, to NYMEX less approximately $0.30. The reasons for the improvement are primarily twofold. The first reason is that we'll have a full year of marketing on the Gulf expansion project, which came online in October of 2016. This project moves 150 million per day of our production from Pennsylvania to the Gulf Coast. The second reason is that we'll have a full year of our North Louisiana gas production, which receives near NYMEX pricing.", "Our NGL pricing is also expected to improve to about 28% to 30% of WTI for 2017, which is significantly better than pricing in 2015 and 2016, while producing over 50,000 barrels per day of ethane and about 50,000 barrels per day of C3+. This is particularly exciting, considering WTI prices have also improved. There are three primary drivers behind the NGL improvements. The first is that we'll have a full year of transportation on the Mariner East pipeline, providing us better netbacks to international markets with the optionality of domestic sales if it makes sense seasonally. The second is that we'll have a full year of our North Louisiana NGLs, which are well located and receive Mont Belvieu pricing. The third reason is that overall NGL pricing has improved relative to WTI on improved supply-demand fundamentals.", "Condensate pricing for 2017 is also expected to be significantly better as a result of having a full year of our new condensate agreement sales in Appalachia, plus a full year of our North Louisiana condensate production, which receives near NYMEX pricing. We're projecting a 40% improvement in our condensate differential to WTI minus $5 to $6.", "Now looking at costs, we're expecting to see continuance of our low-cost structure in 2017. Combining improved netback pricing with lower cash costs results a projected margin of 40% for 2017, which is a great uplift over what we've seen the past couple of years. Taking this one step further, our expected future development costs for PUD reserves is $0.42, which results in an unhedged recycle ratio of approximately 2.8 times. This is excellent and will be at or near the top of our peers when considering either oil or gas companies.", "Shifting now to an asset base that underpins these financial improvements, I'd like to start in North Louisiana, as the team has made some very significant progress early on. In North Louisiana, our well costs were $8.7 million when we closed the acquisition in September. Today, we're drilling and completing wells for $7.7 million. Ray will discuss this is more in detail, but this capital cost reduction obviously has a dramatic impact on the economics of a well, and we're very encouraged by the early improvements of the team. Importantly, these lower well costs also expand the inventory of wells to drill, including generating attractive returns in the Lower Red and potentially in the Pink horizons.", "In addition to driving the cost to drill and complete down, our team has done so while keeping the wells entirely within zone. This should improve the wells' performance versus any well that was out of zone for a portion of the lateral. In addition, we're now targeting a much tighter landing zone, and we're keeping the wells within the tighter target. This technique significantly improved the performance of our Marcellus wells and has done so in other plays as well. As we complete wells with this tighter targeting over the coming months and have some production history, we'll see if the technique works here as well. The bottom line is that the team has completed the trifecta. They're drilling the wells at a significantly lower cost while keeping them totally within zone and also within a tighter target window.", "In regard to the North Louisiana extension areas, we've drilled three wells and have disclosed the results of those wells in our earlier press release. Based on the encouraging initial results of the wells east and west of Vernon field, we're also planning additional tests this year. As we mentioned before, the Upper Red thickens in these wells and consists of three zones versus one in Terryville. Likewise, the Lower Red thickens in these wells and becomes three zones versus one in Terryville. Bottom line, there's about two and a half times the net pay and about two and a half times the gas in place in these two areas versus Terryville. The extension area activity in 2017 will be focused on how to best drill, target, and complete and produce the wells in this area to recover as much of the resource as possible.", "As for the majority of our 2017 North Louisiana activity, we will stay focused on driving up production in Terryville and driving down cost, which is consistent with how we originally evaluated the assets. We'll gather additional data and be very scientific and thoughtful as we continue to evaluate the extension areas, which is the way we do business at Range.", "Moving to the Marcellus, we're seeing improvements in normalized well costs and therefore rates of return. These improvements are driven mostly by lateral lengths increasing from about 6,400 feet in 2016 to over 8,000 feet in 2017, which is reflected in our updated economics for the dry, wet, and super-rich areas. Given the recent improvements in NGL pricing, coupled with longer laterals, the wet gas economics are significantly improved versus 2016. Consequently, we'll focus much of our activity there in 2017. We've also made tremendous operational strides in reducing our days to drill and lowering costs through innovation and a focus on costs, which Ray will discuss in more depth. Lastly, our capital efficiency is expected to improve not only from longer laterals and operational improvements, but also from going back onto existing pads and drilling within our built-out gathering system.", "So 2017 is shaping up to be a good year for Range. Importantly, the improvements we see in 2017 should continue into 2018 and beyond, resulting in better margins and a class-leading recycle ratio. Range is one of the few in the industry with a decade plus of high-quality drilling locations. We have a deep bench of stacked pays in both Pennsylvania and North Louisiana. Plus, we have the optionality of drilling dry or wet, which is important considering the recovery of NGL pricing.", "Hitting on the natural gas macro, first looking at the near term, 2017 is shaping up to be a better year than 2016, or much better than 2016. Last year was the first year since 2005 that natural gas production in the U.S. declined on a year-over-year basis, setting up a more balanced market that we believe the current activity levels are not sufficient to supply the increased demand that we see coming in 2018 and beyond. Looking at NGLs, propane pricing relative to WTI have improved to levels that we've not seen in years. And the rest of the NGL barrel has also improved. This is meaningful to Range, as we're going to be producing approximately 100,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids in 2017.", "Looking beyond this year, there's significant demand for natural gas coming from LNG exports, Mexican exports, power generation, and industrial use. In total by 2020, about 14 Bcf per day of additional natural gas demand is projected to occur. In addition to the roughly 14 Bcf of additional demand, it takes more than 6 Bcf per year to offset the base decline in the U.S. In aggregate, that's 14 Bcf of demand, plus about 24 Bcf per day of base decline, which is a total of about 38 Bcf per day of new gas that's required by the end of 2020. Looking forward, Range remains well-positioned in the two best gas and gas liquids plays in North America.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff. Production for the fourth quarter came in at 1.854 Bcf equivalent per day, and for the year we grew production 11% over 2015, with our exit rate 16% higher than it was in 2015. Guidance for 2017 is 33% to 35% growth, which will put us at approximately 2.07 Bcf equivalent per day net for the year. Guidance for the first quarter will be set at 1.92 Bcf equivalent per day, with 30% to 32% liquids. For 2017, our CapEx budget is approximately $1.15 billion, split about two-thirds in the Marcellus and one-third in North Louisiana.", "As you're aware, a portion of this year's budget will serve to reverse the significant ramp down in spending over the past three years. So while generating solid growth for 2017, this year's capital program really contributes to production growth in 2018 by getting us back on a normal trajectory. This encompasses spending on things like pad construction, roads, water infrastructure, production facilities, top holes, and things that we term, quote, \"generating completable, lateral footage,\" close quotes, where the production from these expenditures really occurs in 2018.", "Incredibly, if you look at our D&C budget of $1.07 billion for 2017, we're actually spending less than we did in 2012, 2013, and 2014 prior to the downturn, but our 2017 program is still generating impressive growth and setting us up for 20% growth in 2018, despite having a production base that is triple the size that it was in 2012. This is possible because of the efficiency gains we've seen from hydrating our assets and now going into a full development mode in the Marcellus. Our 2017 capital plan has us running approximately five rigs and two to three frac crews in Southwest Pennsylvania this year, and four rigs with up to three frac crews at a time in North Louisiana. Starting with the Marcellus, we continue to make great strides in unit cost reductions, and our capital efficiency continues to improve.", "I'd like to take a few minutes here and talk about some impressive examples. Looking at water logistics and sourcing, because we don't own a separate water MLP, we're 100% focused on reducing costs associated with water handling, and our shareholders receive 100% of that benefit. This has been a big area of improvement, not only improving LOE by 39% over the prior year, but also reducing our capital expenditures for water by over $30 million in 2016. We've reduced the average completion costs per foot of lateral by 14% year over year, while pumping a record number of stages in 2016 with less frac crews than we had in the prior year.", "Our top three pads completed in 2016 averaged over eight and a half stages a day for a total of 432 stages. The best pad achieved a completion cost per foot almost 23% below the average, which again was already 14% lower than the previous year. We achieved a 17% reduction in CapEx for production facilities, resulting in over $6 million in savings as a result of design improvements, reductions in contract labor and materials, and redeployment of existing equipment.", "On the drilling side, we've realized a 40% increase in lateral feet drilled per day as compared to last year. This results in a 27% reduction in average drilling costs per lateral foot compared to the prior year and our top 10 best days for lateral feet drilled in a day were all accomplished during the fourth quarter. In fact, just a couple of weeks back, we set a company record of over 6,100 feet drilled in a single day. The drilling and G&G teams accomplished all of this with zero sidetracks from 2016, illustrating that we're still improving and expect to continue to improve going forward.", "In Southwest Pennsylvania, our current plans have us drilling about a third of our wells on existing pads in 2017, and that number could increase to as much as half of our wells in 2018. Our average drilled lateral length in 2017 is projected to be well over 8,000 feet, and our expectation is that the 2018 average will be longer. For example, we're currently drilling the third of three wells on a pad that will average over 15,100 feet per well. What's important is that we have the ability to drill longer laterals, drill on existing pads with permits in hand and infrastructure in place.", "Let me call your attention to our updated economics cost and type curves in the presentation on the website. Please take a look at slide 10, which summarizes the data from all the Marcellus areas with activity in 2017. Again, we believe our cost and performance are the best in the southwest portion of the basin. I also want to point out that these are expected averages for the year and are inclusive of all the costs, including facilities, and factor in all the midstream expenses using actual realized prices. Our well costs include all expected increases in services and supplies that we see in 2017.", "As we go throughout the year, I believe our technical and operational team will continue to optimize the plan and continue to beat these averages, as they have year after year. A good example of how this happens is a seven-well pad that we just approved a few weeks back that is projected to average 10,079-foot laterals with 50 stage completions per well for an average cost including all the facilities of $6.3 million per well. Thus, on a normalized per thousand foot basis, the cost is estimated to be $625,000, yielding a projected EUR of over 3.5 Bcf per 1,000 foot per well \u2013 clearly much better than the expected average case.", "I would also like to highlight a wet area pad in Southwest Pennsylvania that we brought online during the fourth quarter. It was a four-well pad averaging 9,265-foot laterals completed with an average of 46 stages per well. The average peak 24-hour production rate to sales under constrained conditions was 35.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well. The seven-day average to sales, again under constrained conditions, was 28.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well. Importantly, on a normalized basis, the 30-day cumulative production of these wells is 30% higher than the average offset, with the new wells flowing at significantly higher and constrained flowing pressures. I believe this pad represents some of the upside we expect to see as we go back into our underdeveloped core areas with longer laterals. We literally have thousands of these opportunities going forward. Again, please refer to our earnings release, where we provide the expected number of wells by area with all the average cost, recoveries, and economics that we have in our current plan for 2017.", "Our team continues to investigate creative new technologies. For example, in April of 2016, the team successfully executed a three-well pad in our wet area with a new pinpoint stimulation technology. The idea is to get more uniform and consistent proppant placement on a cluster-by-cluster basis along the wellbore. Production of the three-well pad at year-end was on average 22% higher than that of the closest offsets. The cost of this initial test on a standalone basis was about 20% higher. However, we expect the costs to come down significantly as we do more of these completions. We're currently planning additional applications for 2017.", "Another example: The team rolled out initiatives to exploit Big Data technology using machine learning or artificial intelligence. These groundbreaking tools have significantly reduced the time required to update well forecasts and assess the economic performance of different development scenarios in almost real time. We are big believers in making data-driven decisions that are based on, and tailored to, our large inventory of core area assets. And the team's innovation and resulting successes speak to that.", "So shifting to North Louisiana. We're incredibly excited about what John and the team there are doing. But, first, let me take a step back to where we were in mid-September. Our expectations for the acquisition were initially grouped into three categories. First, we believed strongly we could lower well cost, improve operations, lower unit cost, and improve targeting in Terryville. This is where our focus is and will remain so throughout this year. We've made great strides and exceeded a lot of those expectations already. Secondly, we believed our cost and targeting focus could increase our potential drilling inventory in other horizons in Terryville, namely the Lower Red and the Pink intervals. Additionally, we believed there were marketing synergies and advantages. Both of these look promising. Thirdly and longer term, we also believed there was significant upside in the extension area, potentially developing more Terryville-like fields with expanded stacked pay opportunities that also exhibited significant overpressure and higher gas in place. As you know, we recently released the early data from our first three tests, which verified that that potential is real. So we'll be working very methodically and strategically to delineate that potential as we go forward. But again, as you would expect, our primary focus will continue to be on Terryville.", "So let me cover some of the successes and highlights from our activity at Terryville. We've reduced our average all-in well cost for a 7,500-foot lateral by another almost 12% to $7.7 million while reducing drilling time, refining the target window, and staying 100% in zone. This is over $1 million less than we reported just last quarter, which obviously has a major impact on the economics. It not only improves the economics on an Upper Red well, but also opens up some of the Lower Red and Pink potential in Terryville.", "So how did we get there? On the drilling side, Scott and his team have made great strides, setting all sorts of company and field records resulting in lower cost. Since taking over, they've drilled the fastest two wells, spud to rig release, the most daily footage drilled, the fastest curve, and the longest drill-out under intermediate casing with a single bit. They've reduced drilling time by 11%, lowering costs by over $300,000 per well by increasing mud motor and MWD reliability using more aggressive motors and bits, and responsive and real-time decision-making.", "New drilling rig contracts with reduced day rates, along with ancillary contract negotiations, have lowered overall spread cost, dealing an additional $125,000 per well cost savings. Casing costs have also been reduced by over $50,000 per well by utilizing the Range supply chain management team. We reduced our mobilization time significantly. We've brought in different vendors and a lot of new technology. And this was all done while routinely staying 100% in the new refined target window, which is now around 30 feet versus 90 to 100 feet before.", "On the completions front, Jeremy and the completions team have refined our completion designs, resulting in less impacts on offset production. We're routinely pumping almost twice as many stages per day as in the past, greatly reducing costs and cycle times. We've reduced the flowback equipment and coiled tubing costs by over $300,000 per well by utilizing more efficient designs and operations. And our design changes have helped us reduce our fracturing costs by over $200,000 per well. We started the year with a plan of completing eight stages per day, and I'm happy to report that we're routinely pumping 12 to 15 stages per day. And one crew achieved a high of 17 stages per day on a three-well pad while pumping between 330,000 and 350,000 pounds of proppant per stage. All of this accelerates our return of capital.", "And on the G&G side, Kyle and his team are approaching near full 3-D seismic coverage across the Terryville area and the expansion areas, as well as acquiring significant new core and reservoir characterization data that will help direct our development going forward. All of this helps to open up a large inventory of future locations on our Terryville acreage. Please see these economics presented on page 11 in our updated presentation. Again, these economics and our capital plan in North Louisiana have baked in our service pricing for the year. We fully expect that improvements in our operations and designs will more than offset any modest service price increase that we have baked into our 2017 plan.", "By the end of March, we'll have completed 26 wells so far this year, utilizing up to three frac crews since the start of the year. These include 19 completions in the Upper Red, five in the Lower Red interval, and two in the Pink intervals. Of these wells, 18 were drilled by the Memorial team prior to Range and have waited an average of 10 months to be completed. Eight of the wells were drilled by the Range team with improved targeting and will average just three months waiting on completion. While the first quarter was dominated by all of the completion activity, we do expect to smooth the frac schedule out over the year to get to a steadier pace of one to two frac crews working consistently as we go into 2018.", "So switching to marketing for a few minutes, as Jeff mentioned earlier, our netbacks continued to improve in the fourth quarter, with a full quarter of North Louisiana production and with the addition of Spectra's Gulf Markets project going in service in early October. Additionally, we've received favorable news regarding other takeaway projects where Range is a long-term capacity holder. Spectra's Adair Southwest Project and TransCanada's Leach and Rayne XPress projects have now received final FERC certificates with projected in-service dates in late 2017. The combined capacity from these projects for Range is 400,000 dekatherms per day out of the Appalachian Basin to the Gulf Coast, further improving our expected pricing. In addition, Energy Transfer's Rover project was approved earlier this month.", "Touching on North Louisiana quickly, there is an incredible amount of existing downstream infrastructure in the area to markets and liquidity at near NYMEX pricing. This does not require any significant contract capacity commitments, as there are several large trunklines around our acreage. You almost couldn't place a field in a better area for accessing demand in the Gulf and the Southeast.", "Combining our existing base of transport capacity, our Louisiana production, and the 400,000 dekatherms per day from Adair Southwest and Leach/Rayne, approximately 85% of our gas will move to better markets by year-end 2017. As Jeff mentioned, this solid base of natural gas sales gives us confidence that we will improve our corporate differential dramatically to approximately minus $0.30 for 2017. This is nearly a $0.20 improvement over what we've realized for the past couple of years and significantly improves our margins.", "In summary, our Marcellus team is continuing to improve returns through lower cost and improved well performance as we continue to develop our extensive inventory of core locations with longer laterals. In North Louisiana, we've achieved outstanding results in a short amount of time and expect more of the same going forward. And our marketing philosophy that we've followed for many years now is paying off by improving our margins and setting us up well for many years of profitable growth.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials.", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, Ray. Continued financial progress was made in the fourth quarter to complement the operating progress Ray just mentioned. Financially, we turned the corner in the third quarter of this year, and the fourth quarter results show that we're gaining momentum as we further exit the down cycle. The fourth quarter results exhibit demonstrable improvement in top line revenue, cash flow, and cost control over earlier quarters in 2016 and over the fourth quarter of 2015.", "Revenues from natural gas, NGL, and oil sales, before hedging entries, was $459 million, 81% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. Cash flow at $254 million was 24% higher. EBITDAX at $299 million was also 24% higher than last year. Cash margin at $1.48 an Mcfe was 80% higher than the third quarter of this year. Fourth quarter earnings calculated using common analyst methodology, which excludes nonrecurring items, was $56 million, 33% higher than last year's fourth quarter.", "To help place the fourth quarter in perspective, cash flow in the fourth quarter was more than double the third quarter of this year and more than the first two quarters of this year combined. The last quarter where cash flow was higher than $254 million was two years ago, in the fourth quarter of 2014. These improvements from prior periods stem from continued margin gains from our new long-term takeaway capacity on Mariner East and the new Gulf Markets expansion project, combined with improvements in our cost structure, consistent organic growth, and completion of the Memorial transaction.", "Full-year 2016 cash flow was $569 million, and full-year EBITDAX was $723 million. These figures include only 15 weeks of results from North Louisiana. If one includes a full year of EBITDAX from the North Louisiana assets, as used when calculating a trailing four-quarter debt to EBITDAX leverage ratio, EBITDAX totals $1.033 billion. Fully diluted cash flow per share for the fourth quarter was $1.04 and for the full year was $2.99 per share.", "The DD&A rate is always reset during the fourth quarter of each year to reflect the results of our year-end reserve report. Our DD&A rate for the fourth quarter was $0.88 per Mcfe, down 9% from the fourth quarter of last year. Five years ago, in 2011, the DD&A rate was $1.80 per Mcfe. Reducing the DD&A rate by almost half over a relatively short period of time reflects the dramatic improvement in capital efficiency brought about from high-grading our asset base through the sale of non-core assets and further improving our processes as we develop our sizable position in the Marcellus.", "As for our cash operating expenses during the quarter, all items came in at or below fourth quarter guidance, except for G&A, coming in $0.02 high due to some nonrecurring land administration expenses. Another expense item impacted by nonrecurring activity was transportation, gathering, and compression expense, which at $0.96 was $0.08 below guidance. The major contributor to this cost improvement was a one-time cash payment associated with the extension of our MarkWest agreements. The extension provided an opportunity to settle the cumulative true-up items of both parties. To assist listeners with their financial projections, the fourth quarter earnings release contains detailed expense item guidance for the first quarter of 2017.", "Over on the balance sheet, things were quiet and stable following the closing of the Memorial transaction. Total debt was down slightly from end of the third quarter. And with cash flow building sequentially each quarter, we expect the leverage ratio has peaked and will begin to drift down as we move further into 2017 and 2018. Thanks to improving margins and our strongest-ever finding and development cost performance, our forward-looking recycle ratio, using either hedged or unhedged revenue, approaches 3 times, which demonstrates our ability to not only replace our production but also meaningfully grow within cash flow.", "The fourth quarter provided many opportunities to add to the Range 2017 and 2018 hedge positions. Significant volume increases were added to our hedge positions across all products. Currently, over 75% of our 2017 natural gas production is hedged, with an average floor price of $3.22 an MMbtu. Going forward, our hedging practices remain consistent: to opportunistically hedge a significant portion of our expected production in order to have a more predictable cash flow which supports efficient operations and our ongoing capital program. Please reference the just-filed 10-K and Range website for specific hedge volume and price information.", "As good as the fourth quarter of 2016 was from a financial perspective, we look forward to even more improvements in margins and cash flow going further into 2017, as the out-of-basin capacity on Rayne and Leach XPress becomes operational, production increases from both of our core areas, and we experience a full year of higher prices and better margins from our diverse portfolio of marketing contracts.", "Jeff, I'll turn it back over to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Ventura. The question and answer session will now begin. And the first question is from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Arun Jayaram at JPM. My first question just regards the 80% planned allocation to liquids or the wet area and super rich in the Marcellus. Why was that the right number? And I'm thinking about just the returns that you guys cite in your deck versus the Southwest PA dry gas area.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, Arun, this is Ray. I think the answer's got two parts. I think, one, we see a greatly improving market for liquids over the next several years, and with the great contracts we have, and when you fold in the large core inventories of liquids-rich locations that we have, we think this is going to create a ton of value going forward. And you've really seen improvements in liquids showing up, of course, in the fourth quarter numbers as a result of some of our great contracts, but we've also seen substantial improvements in ethane and propane and so forth since the first of the year.", "And then, secondly, we've got a huge inventory of existing pads and infrastructure and really a core liquids-rich area that's underdeveloped at this point. And I think as you see us moving into a true development mode, we're taking advantage of that. And I think that's an advantage that's really unique to the Range story, and you're going to see improving well performance, improving capital efficiencies. At least a third of our wells are going to be on existing pads this year.", "And I don't know if you heard in my remarks about that four-well pad we just did that's 9,300-foot laterals and has already cumed in 30 days 30% more than the offsets, and we're talking substantial improvements in Bcf per thousand foot over what we've seen in the past. And literally, we have \u2013 I said it before \u2013 we have thousands of those opportunities going forward, and I think I can say with confidence that the team is going to far exceed those average numbers that you see in the press release, and clearly those economics are going to be outstanding going forward. And we just really see a great market looking into the future over the next couple of years with all the ethane and propane improvements that we see there.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "And I'd just tack on what Ray said. When you look at the economics in the book, as we have every year, that's just strip pricing as of December 31. If you look at where we are today, gas is lower, liquids are probably better in the NGLs. So in addition what Ray said above, when you take that into account today, that gap is narrower, and really that's saying the strip is very volatile over a short period of time. If you look at what we're trying to do, we're managing through the cycles. We're looking forward a year, two, five, and 10 years. Ultimately, we're going to drill all those locations.", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Fair enough. Thanks for that. And my follow-up, just wanted to get your perspective. There's been some talk from the buy side regarding potential gas-on-gas competition if the TRP Mainline kind of goes through with their rate reduction. I know you guys have some volumes committed on Rover, so I wondered if you could, from a marketing perspective, talk about the potential impact to netbacks to Dawn from a Range perspective if that project goes through.", "Chad L. Stephens - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, hi. This is Chad Stephens. I run our marketing team. So on Rover, half of our volume goes to MichCon Citygate and Dawn, and half goes to the Gulf Coast. We think that the TransCanada offering that they just had an open season on is going to be difficult to feel because the arb or spread between the prices they're getting in the Western Sedimentary Basin and Dawn and the cost to get the gas there, it's going to be difficult. But whether it gets done or not, we feel like with our volumes going \u2013 about half going to MichCon and half going to the Gulf Coast, it doesn't put us in a difficult situation.", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Fair enough. Thank you, gentlemen.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Pearce Hammond of Simmons.", "Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray", "Thanks for taking my questions. Jeff, obviously the winter has been very warm, and gas storage estimates here for April 1 have been ballooning upwards. And then the price of gas has settled lower. Is there a gas price that you would say, hey, we're going to dial things back a little bit? Or do you feel like with all the hedging that you have in place, that right now you're pretty comfortable with your plan and you're just going to move forward with that?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, I think if you look at where we are for 2017, we're well-hedged, we're comfortable with our plan, and we'll move forward. And then I think if you look into 2018, there are several thoughts there. One is there's multiple ways to win, even if gas is a little lower and closer to strip. We see differentials that could even improve, beyond what we have in there. NGL pricing and netbacks could be better. Cost structure inefficiencies I think will get better. So I think you look across 2017-2018, we're in good shape. And then I still think if you look out far enough and you take into account incremental gas demand's coming and account for base decline that has to be overcome, there's a story brewing for gas. And, last but not least, I'd add in with gas prices where they are for people that aren't hedged, or even with some people saying oil prices may fall back in the second half of the year, actually lower prices in 2017 might help 2018, even though the strip doesn't reflect that right now.", "Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray", "Great. Thanks, Jeff. And then my follow-up \u2013 I appreciate the prepared remarks on the improvements in the NGL market. I'd love to get a little more color on what you guys see as far as the opportunity set for Range over the next few years with the ethane market and how you see ethane's supply-demand over the next few years in the U.S.?", "Chad L. Stephens - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, this is Chad Stephens. I'll take that. We think that the ethane markets, both domestically and globally, are improving. There's several crackers coming online in the Gulf Coast in mid to late 2018 and coming into 2019. Those stocks are high right now. We feel like they'd be \u2013 several hundred thousand barrels a day demand that's represented in those crackers that's coming online will more than offset the supply that's available there. Also, propane with the ME 2 (sic) [ME 1] project that we're involved in and the propane that we're flowing through and putting on boats to the global markets is really flowing through currently into the improved NGL prices you see. And we see global propane demand increasing, PDH plants in China, the energy use for propane in Japan. So we see over the next several years propane demand increasing as well.", "Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray", "Great.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, and I'll just tack onto that, Pearce. Chad said ME 2, but we're actually on ME 1, right?", "Chad L. Stephens - Range Resources Corp.", "ME 1, yeah, sorry.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Didn't want to confuse anybody there. But with the great contracts we have on Mariner East 1, on Mariner West and ATEX and the improving markets that Chad was just referring to, we're pretty well set up. Our goal all along for years has been to have a diverse set of outlets and a diverse set of pricing scenarios. I think we're finally beginning to see how that's serving us really, really well. And what's important \u2013 it's going to offer us a ton of optionality going forward. So we can sit back and wait and see what Mariner East phase 2 is going to look like, or Mariner East 2X and the Shell cracker and all these other things. We've got lots of opportunities going forward, and I think that that's going to be a unique story for us as since we were so early on in these other projects.", "Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray", "Thanks, Ray.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Good morning.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "The ability to increase lateral length relative to the contiguousness of your acreage has long been a question, and it's certainly notable, you're at Range is substantially increasing lateral lengths in the 2017 program. Can you talk about whether the 2017 program is representative of the lateral lengths through the rest of the southwest Marcellus portfolio? And can you give us a sense of where you expect the lateral lengths to trend in future years?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, Brian. It's a great question, and I think something that's not well-understood. But we literally have thousands of opportunities when you think about the hundred and some odd existing pads that we have that were all set up for anywhere from 15 to 20 different well locations, and most of them are five or six wells or less per pad. So it sets us up really well, and you've seen consistently, I think last year our average lateral length was around 6,400 or 6,500, something in that range. This year I think I can say with confidence it's going to be well over 8,000 feet. I think with the same amount of confidence, even more so, I think I still see those numbers going up significantly in 2018 and 2019.", "I think eventually, if you look at it on a whole, I think the optimal lateral length that we see in the dry gas areas is probably over 10,000 feet. And I think in the liquids-rich areas I think we see some \u2013 the optimal average is probably going to be a little less than 10,000 feet. But, again, we've got more and more examples every day coming up like the one I talked about in my prepared remarks, that we're currently on a pad where we're drilling the third of three wells that's going to be over 15,000 feet. I think the average for that pad's going to be 15,100. And we've got several more of those pads coming up. So the fact that we've got this large core inventory of existing pads, we have a lot of flexibility in how those units are formed and reformed, and the ability to do that is really going to set us up for some big capital efficiency improvements going forward.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great, thanks. And then shifting to Louisiana. You mentioned before that post the extension wells that you drilled that you see a gas in place that's pretty significant and expectations for EURs to be in line with what you're seeing in Terryville. What is the specific plan activity-wise in the extension area in 2017? And what are your expectations for what the wells you're drilling this year are going to deliver and tell you?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, like I said, in our last press release, we put out the early results on the first three wells, and those three wells are \u2013 two of the three wells, the ones east and west, are still performing right in line with what we had talked about previously, right in between the Lower Red and the Upper Red type curves, so we're real pleased of those. Those are first up at bats. We've got a lot of work to do in reservoir characterization and modeling and a ton of science we need to do. We've permitted three more wells. We're in various stages of drilling pilot holes and taking cores, and I think we got one lateral waiting on a completion. I'm not sure what the timing's going to be on that.", "All of that stuff we're developing very methodical, strategic plans that are going to be very data based, and they're going to be pretty slow going through this year. So I think the results, as we get more meaningful results that we have a lot of confidence in, we'll be able to talk about those, but I think those are going to be later this year. And our focus is still going to stay at Terryville, because that's clearly where we're seeing all the big wins. Lowering the cost by $1 million just in the last quarter is phenomenal, and I can say with great confidence it's going to go a lot lower. So I think that we're going to see some big, big things out of Terryville going forward. It's pretty exciting.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And your next question is from Ron Mills of Johnson Rice.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Good morning, guys. A question just on capital allocation, this year's two-thirds Marcellus and one-third North Louisiana. As you get more wells drilled in Louisiana and given the relative return profiles, do you foresee a situation where in 2018 or 2019 or beyond that the spending could be more equal between those areas?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, I think well, the good news is we have optionality there as you look forward. So there's good things happening in Louisiana, and of course with the pricing, that's a big advantage and all that, but there's good things happening up in the Marcellus, too. You're seeing a lot of improvements, longer laterals, better netbacks, new transportation agreements kicking in. So we'll continue to look at that as we go forward and turn that knob to where we think is optimum for any one particular year or time.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, Ray, can you go over again in terms of lateral lengths on the dry gas versus the liquids-rich areas up in the Marcellus in terms of where you think they can go? And does that have any impact on potential well spacing?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Sure. I think what I've been saying for some time now is we believe, from looking at what the optimum spacing and lateral length and all that is, I would say today that we're thinking in the dry areas of Southwest PA, you're looking at probably in excess of 10,000 feet. I don't know if I'd say 11,000 or 12,000, but somewhere between 10,000 and 12,000 foot, we feel like will probably be the optimal lateral length from an economics and return standpoint. I think as far as well spacing, we're probably looking at between 750 and 1,000 foot in general.", "I think as you go more and more liquids, that spacing could get a little bit closer, and we still have in our presentation some of the extended tests, 500-foot spacing, and some of that stuff that looks really, really good. And then also the infill wells that we put on some of the existing pads, we've continued to update those examples in the PowerPoint also. So I'd encourage you to look at that, and the results are still very impressive. So I think to sum it up, dry areas are longer; liquids-rich areas are probably a little bit shorter just simply because of the physics of the issue.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Maybe flipped the other way, Ray.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Oh, did I say it wrong?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, you said it backwards.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "I'm sorry. Well, I'm talking about lateral lengths. The lateral lengths will be longer in dry and probably a little bit shorter \u2013 probably a little less than 10,000 foot in liquids. Spacing would be closer in liquids and a little bit further apart in dry. I think that says it clearer.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. Yeah. The other thing I'd say is we have a really big acreage position.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Right.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "And we have the ability, back to Brian's question, it's really a big blocky position. If somebody says otherwise, that's fake news, to use that term. So we have the ability to drill long. And what you're seeing us do, again, is we try to be very thoughtful and methodical, scientific, data-driven, so we're drilling some 15,000-foot wells as we speak. We have some 10,000-foot wet wells, like Ray said, that are phenomenal. So we'll look at where that optimum is. It's probably a little early to say where it is. It's longer than we are, so we'll continue to march out, but we'll step out like we are with 15,000-foot wells, so we can see what that data looks like, and then again, dial it to where we think is optimum as we move forward with time. But that'll drive increasing efficiencies.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Great. I appreciate it. The rest have been answered. Thanks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question is from Bob Morris of Citi.", "Robert S. Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Ray, just following up on the lateral lengths in Southwest PA. The average lateral length you said is going to be just over 8,000 foot this year, but you talked about a lot of 10,000 and even 15,000-foot laterals with very good results. So 30-year wells are being driven on pads; that implies that there are going to be a good number of wells drilled at 5,000 or 6,000-foot laterals. Are those shorter laterals strictly on continuing to hold acreage? Or why would you drill shorter laterals anywhere in your program?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Well again, like referring back to Jeff's comments, we have a huge position out there, and there are some areas where you physically can't go more than 5,000 or 6,000 feet, just because it may be somebody else's lease or just a lot of different reasons when you look at that large of an area. So in general, the team is always pushing to drill longer and longer laterals. And again, what we put in the earnings release showing you the plans, that's the plans as of we see them today. And the one thing I can tell you is we're going to change, and just like we have pretty much every year, those lateral lengths will all go longer, and the performance will be better and the costs would be lower. I mean, we've seen that year after year with what the teams have been able to do up there.", "So again, I mean you're exactly right. What we're quoting is averages. So there will be some that are, like I talked about, that seven-well pad we just approved that's over 10,000 foot average. There's a three-well pad that the three 15,000-foot wells, actually on that same pad there's a 5,000-foot lateral. So you average all that up, but in general, we're going to be going a lot longer. And we see that continual improvement in capital efficiency over the next several years for sure.", "Robert S. Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "So the shorter laterals are just due to physical limitations? Just where you don't have acreage blocked out to drill the longer laterals right now?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Or you could have an old well out there that's butting up against that lease, so there's some of that in there.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "But we have a lot of wells that we can drill longer laterals on.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. Like I said, our focus is going to be always going longer.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah.", "Robert S. Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Morning, guys. A question on that slide 38, where you just talked a little bit on the Utica/Point Pleasant. Totally understand your box where you talk about the low-risk, high-return in the Marcellus and North Louisiana, kind of with the focus there. Is there a few more well \u2013 I guess, what would you be waiting to see in order to accelerate the program there, would be my, I guess, larger question?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, it's a good question. And our well \u2013 I mean, the good news is we've drilled I guess three wells in the Utica, and our third well is clearly one of the top four in the play. And so when looking at going forward, we're still basically in a wait-and-see mode, Neal. The issue is, as much as we've improved cost and understanding and everything else, you're still looking at something that cost 2.5 times more than a Marcellus well. And I quoted one in my remarks, a four-well pad that averaged over 9,200 feet for around $6.3 million per well that's making 30% more. It's going to be way above a 20 Bcf well. And so we just don't see it \u2013 it's going to be a compatible play or comparable play, something that at some point it's going to make sense to pull the trigger on. But in this current market and given the fact that we have literally thousands of these kind of locations that we're talking about to do going forward, I just don't see it competing with the Marcellus in our case anytime soon.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, and it's back to, that play's in an earlier state, so you'd be spending a lot of R&D dollars to try to unlock it when, like Ray said, we've got a lot of much higher probability, stronger economic wells to drill instead. But at some point, there'll be a lot of value to it.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Sure, sure. And then just lastly -", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "We hold all those deep rights, by the way, so we -", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, we have 400,000 acres so -", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, it's captured.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "It's all HBP, Jeff?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Right.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yes.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. And then just lastly on the hedging, how active I guess, or how liquid is the NGL market if you're able to try to not do a dirty hedge but try to hedge each of the components right now out a year or two or three?", "Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, this is Laith. There's really no problem hedging out a couple years. Liquidity gets a little more challenged if you get out beyond a couple years, but we're also on the physical side able to hedge some of that. If you're looking at propane and some of the sales out of Mariner East you're able to do that through some physical sales as well.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Yeah, I've seen that. Okay. Great. Thanks, Laith.", "Operator", "We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Marshall Carver of Heikkinen Energy for our final question.", "Marshall H. Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC", "Yes. Thank you. Most my questions were answered, but I do have one left. You had very good results in two of the initial extension wells in North Louisiana. With the higher net pay in the extension areas in multiple zones, do you think those first couple wells targeted the best possible zone? Or do you see any room for improvement there in terms of targeting now that you've been looking at it a little bit longer?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "That's a great question, Marshall, and back to \u2013 what we said is those wells, really they're east and west of Vernon. They're more like Vernon, so you've got instead of just Terryville, you've got one Upper Red; down there you've got three Upper Reds. In Terryville you've got one Lower Red; there you've got three Lower Reds. And all these laterals are just in one of the six zones. Did we pick the optimum zone? Did we optimally drill and complete it? And actually \u2013 I mean, you can go on and on. That's why there's tremendous upside. We're excited about the 400 Bcf per section, the high pressure, the thicker interval. And which of those six laterals is best ultimately that we developed \u2013 who knows? Four of six or five of six or two of six? So there's a lot of upside and a lot of potential there, so it gives us optionality. We just want to be very thoughtful how to go forward. Like Ray said \u2013 he talked about all the types of data we're gathering to help understand that.", "Marshall H. Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC", "All right. And the next wells will be likely the second half of this year?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, I think before we can talk about any results that are meaningful, I think, yeah, we're looking later this year. Like I said, we're in various stages of drilling pilot holes and thinking \u2013 I think we've got one lateral that's ready to be completed, but we're waiting on a lot of the rock data and the stuff back from the cores and valuations of all the logs that we've run to figure out and design those ultimate completions and figure out the best fluids for it and that sort of thing. Like Jeff said, there's just a ton of work to do, and with all the great success and our focus on Terryville, we're able to basically take our time and make some real data-driven decisions going into this extension area.", "Marshall H. Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC", "All right. Sounds good. Thank you very much.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "You bet.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question and answer session.

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney L. Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2013 with record reserves, record production and continuing decrease in unit cost. Both earnings and cash flow per share results were greater than the First Call consensus.", "The order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have Chad Stephens, our Senior Vice President in-charge of Marketing will be available to answer questions after our prepared remarks.", "Range did file our 10-K with the SEC today. It should be available on the home page of our website or you can access it using the SEC\u2019s EDGAR system. In addition, we have posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of reported earnings to our adjusted non-GAAP earnings that are discussed on the call today.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you, Rodney. I will begin by looking back on what we accomplished in 2013 and then I will look ahead to what we expect for 2014.", "Last year, we grew production 25% with capital budget of $1.3 billion. Cash flow increased 25% year-over-year and cash flow per share debt-adjusted also grew 26% year-over-year.", "Our proved reserves grew 26%, 8.2 Tcfe, which equates to replacing 612% of our production. This was done at an all-in cost of find and develop at $0.61 per mcfe. Reserves per share debt-adjusted increased 25%, while production per share debt-adjusted grew 26%. As a result of our development activity, we have moved 6.4 Tcfe of unproved resource potential to proved reserves over the past four years. Because of this excellent performance, our total DD&A rate has declined from $2.33 per mcfe in 2009 to $1.44 in 2013. And in the fourth quarter of 2013 was a $1.36. Looking at the same time period, our operating expense per mcfe declined from $0.83 to $0.36 and in the fourth quarter of 2013 was $0.36.", "The bottom line is that Range is continuing to improve its capital and operating efficiency and the results are flowing through to the bottom line. Net income for 2013 was $116 million, up from $13 million in 2012. Late last year, the Mariner West project became fully operational and the ATEX project started line fill on December. Also in December, we reached two new milestones of our gross Marcellus production reached 1 Bcfe per day and our corporate net production reached 1Bcfe per day. In summary, 2013 was an excellent year in both operational performance and financial performance.", "Looking to 2014, I believe there will be three key items that will distinguish performance between companies in our industry. The first is, owning a sizable position, sizable acreage position in the core area one on the key plays such as the Marcellus. The second is the ability to consistently execute well; and the third is having a strong forward thinking marketing team.", "The first item is critical because the application of the technology of horizontal drilling in multiple stage hydraulic fracturing has been applied to most of the domestic basins. Therefore most of the major plays have probably already been identified and leased. The key then is to already have a large concentrated acreage position in the core one of the key plays.", "The economics are very different in the core versus non-core portions due to the differences in raw quality and its impact on productivity of wells. It\u2019s also interesting to note that in shale plays, the core areas usually represent a small fraction of the play, somewhere around 6% to 17% of the total shale acreage. The non-core then totaled 83% to 94% of the play. Fortunately, we have a huge position in the core of the Marcellus, which is the best gas play in North America, maybe the world, given the economics of the Marcellus and the rest elsewhere.", "I also believe the ability to consistently execute at a high level, we came in 2014. In 2013 for instance, simply drilling a horizontal well and announcing a high fee rate will sometimes efficient to increase the Company\u2019s stock price. At this point in time, those plays and resource potential are considered known and I believe they are reflected in the stock price. The key now will be to consistently drive our foreign gas production from these plays.", "Fortunately, Range has a 10 year track record of consistently meeting or exceeding its targets, a 10 year period with a 20% CAGR. Although past performances is no guarantee of the future, we have created a team and culture that consistently performs and meets or exceeds targets. Time after time, rather than succumbing to events like freezing weather, hurricanes and significant infrastructure delays our team finds ways to overcome and achieve its targets.", "Third, for 2014 and beyond having a strong forward-looking marketing team will be vital. Given the renaissance of the U.S oil and gas business, supply is temporarily ahead of demand although I firmly believe demand growth is coming. We believe that Range is very well positioned in this category too. The best evidence for this again is our performance, after discovering the Marcellus in 2004 and bringing the first well on line in 2005.", "We knew the quality of our gas was very high BTU and would not meet pipelines classifications because it contains so much ethane. Early on some in the industry viewed gas this rich is a negative, we were approached by some companies who want the Range to pay a fee to them in order to fix our ethane problem. Rather than accept this solution our team was very creative in building a diversified portfolio three ethane contracts based on three different pricing formulas that will not only ensures our gas net pipeline quality specifications, but would also provide market diversification and enable Range to grow production to greater than 3 Bcfe per day.", "Very importantly rather than these solutions costing us money our team solution enhances the value of the project. If all three marketing arrangements were fully operational today Range\u2019s ethane revenue would increase by 25% compared to leading ethane in the gas stream. That\u2019s net of all transportation and processing cost and including additional propane recovery. I believe this is the best ethane sales portfolio for any company in the U.S. that\u2019s a direct result of our team doing the hard work to make a reality for many people felt could not be done, such as selling ethane to companies in Norway and Canada.", "The same is true for our propane marketing. In addition to supplying propane into good markets in the Northeast in the winter, we can now seasonally export propane to Central and South America and Europe in the summer. Our marketing team has also ahead of the curve in making sure that we can move and market our natural gas. In addition to marketing gas in the Northeast, in 2013 we added 25 new customers in the South, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, secured firm transportation and firm sales to get the gas to the customers and enhance pricing basis. We have tied the sales price of our gas to approximately nine different industries creating a strong diversified natural gas sales portfolio for Range.", "We are currently selling our Appalachian gas to customers in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, Louisiana, Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Delaware, Maryland, Washington D.C., Connecticut, North and South Carolina, Indiana and Illinois. By 2017, our marketing team is working to have the capability of selling our Appalachian gas to customers as far west as Wisconsin, on Atlantic South of Texas, east of Florida and north, the main were projecting that we could be able to move four to five Bcf per day of Appalachian gas where two-thirds of the current U.S. consumption exists.", "For 2014, there will most likely will be intermittent challenges in Appalachian moving gas and in basis differentials for some in the industry. By 2015, we expect as the market improves, the Texas Eastern turns part of the pipeline around the flow gas south and by late that year Transco is expected to having serve partial reversal to move gas out of Appalachian as well.", "In 2016, we believe we will see more Transco, Columbia, Dolphin, Texas Eastern capacity going backwards as compared to the original flows. And in 2017 is projected all of the major pipelines will be bidirectional. I believe that our marketing team assets as well positioned as anyone in the basin and better than a lot of the competition. Capacity constrains in basis differential do not impact all producers equally. The priority of transportation capacity in the markets and pipeline where the production is coming from and moving to, are the key differentiators. Range has been or will remain focused on finding creative and effective solutions for marketing our production.", "On the financial front, we have a strong flexible balance sheet to fund our operating strategy. Range continues to build economies of scale and our structure continues to enhance our competitiveness. Range has continued operational success, use of embedded call options in our debt and the macroeconomic environment and lower interest rates has provided greater access to lower-cost capital.", "Overall, for 2014, I believe that we\u2019re well-positioned. We have a large footprint in the core of the best gas play in the U.S., a technical and operations team that has demonstrated it can execute well and a strong marketing team with a demonstrated track record. As always, we\u2019ll stay focused on safely executing our plan of being good steward to the environment.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr.", "Thanks, Jeff. 2013 was a great year. We saw improvements in well performance, capital efficiency, infrastructure and cost control across all divisions and we expect to see similar improvements in 2014 and beyond, all while working safely.", "Like Jeff said, we have some really great metrics and reaped some important milestones in 2013, but there\u2019s just a couple more achievements that I\u2019d really like to point out. Even with selling our New Mexico assets early in the year and in spite of the delays in the Mariner West pipeline startup, our teams achieved the high end of our production guidance at 25% year-over-year. At the same time, we also saw our direct operating expense decline by 12% for the year.", "I want to take this opportunity to offer congratulations to all our employees for a job well done in 2013. The innovation and focus on per share growth coupled with core values of cost control while working safely and maintaining sound environmental protections, all are translating to the bottom line.", "As Jeff described in his remarks, one of the key items that will distinguish companies with an asset base like Range is execution. Execution is one of our strong points and getting better at what we do year after year is simply what we do here at Range. Let me give you just a few examples based on our last four years. In 2009 we averaged 57 million cubic feet equivalent per day from the Marcellus and in 2013 we averaged 790 million per day. That\u2019s 1161% growth over four years.", "Our direct operating expense per Mcfe corporately has dropped from $0.75 to $0.36 or a drop of 52% from the fourth quarter of 2010. Three examples from southwestern Pennsylvania for the last four years. Today we drill 93% faster and our cost per foot of lateral drilled has decreased by 24%. Today we average about 98 frac stages per crew per month, which is 87% more than we averaged four years ago. And our facilities cost per well is 3% cheaper, while importantly cutting construction time in half and deploying design improvements to enhance facility safety, operations and to exceed emission reduction requirements.", "Needless to say, I can go on and on demonstrating how we\u2019ve achieved tremendous improvement across many metrics while always meeting or exceeding our targets. We believe our track record speaks for itself and again the expectation that improvements will continue year after year is supported by that track record. We own the largest net acreage position in the core of the highest hydrocarbon in place within the basin when considering the Utica/Point Pleasant, the Upper Devonian and the Marcellus. Like Jeff said, having a large acreage position in the core of a top-tier play will be important going forward.", "And thirdly, having an effective team to handle the evolving logistics of gas and liquids marketing in the basin is of critical importance. As discussed in our earnings release and just now by Jeff in his comments, we are well-positioned for several years to move all of our gas and liquids. Marcellus and Utica/Point Pleasant volume growth by industry in the region does not affect these plans and commitments. Range has current firm transportation and/or firm sales in place totaling 1.1 Bcf per day to the key regions previously mentioned and we have 1.6 Bcf per day lined out through 2016, designed to match our planned volume growth. Keep in mind that we\u2019ve also built a broad network of strong relationships with primary buyers in these markets and will continue to maximize the opportunity to sell our gas to them under their firm transportation capacity.", "Importantly, we are one of the very few companies that kept all of our customers hold during the recent polar vortex storms when others could not, due to the extreme weather conditions. We were able to do this as a result of some really innovative facility designs coupled with our operations team going 24x7 and so forth. Teaming up with our midstream partners and led by our marketing group, no Range customer went without product and that fact is really paying dividends.", "As we continue to grow our wet gas volumes, we work closely with our midstream partner, MarkWest to assure that we have adequate gathering, processing and fractionation capacity.", "Our inventory of wells waiting on infrastructure continues to be one of the lowest in the basin. As Jeff discussed, our marketing team has been extremely innovative as demonstrated by our three ethane projects, which again \u2013 when all three projects are fully served, Range\u2019s ethane revenue would increase by over 25% as compared to leaving the ethane in the gas stream and selling it as Btus.", "For 2014 our CapEx budget will be $1.52 billion with 87% of that directed to the Marcellus. There is detailed breakdown of that allocation in our earnings release and in our investor presentation on the website. Most importantly, with this CapEx budget we\u2019ve elected to drill our Marcellus wells with significantly longer laterals and more stages than previously announced.", "This will drive greater EURs and better capital efficiencies that will primarily flow through in 2015 and we expect those lateral links to get even longer as we further and continue to optimize our plans. Production guidance for the first quarter should be right at 1.05 Bcf equivalent per day with approximately 30% to 35% of that being in liquids. While able to supply all our customers during the winter storms we did not go completely unscathed when it comes to production growth.", "There were times when we simply had to shutdown frac operations due to the extreme cold over the last couple of months and we did experience some production downtime. That downtime will impact first quarter growth in volumes as has been the case historically. This is nothing new and was forecasted in our growth trajectory just as we\u2019ve been in the past. For the year, our production guidance remains 20% to 25% year-over-year as we previously stated.", "Going to the southern Marcellus division, we\u2019ve updated the production from the super-rich wells in 2013 in our investor presentation. We now have a zero time plot of all the wells as compared to the 2013 type curve. The takeaway is that the super-rich area wells are performing above our expectations and getting better as we go. I should also point out that we furnished the zero time plot because the six-month production data provided by the state only shows wellhead gas and condensate and some people continue to miss that distinction. This is really important. For example, in the super-rich area you would miss as much as 1.2 million or more barrels of NGL that are really valuable and often represent half or more the total EUR of the well.", "In 2013, in the super-rich area, we had an average lateral length of 3,853 with 20 stages. In 2014, we expect to drill wells with average lateral lengths 38% longer at 5,300 with 26 stage completions resulting in an average EUR of 2.05 million Boe per well.", "For 2015, the lateral lengths in our current plan average 5,600 feet with 28 stages and an average EUR of 2.23 million Boe. In the wet area in 2013 our average lateral was 3,200 feet was 16 stages and for 2014 we are planning a 4,200 feet with 21 stages resulting in an expected average EUR of 12.3 Bcf equivalent. For 2015, the lateral lengths in our current plan averaged 4,800 feet with 24 stages and an expected average EUR of 14 Bcf equivalent.", "In the dry gas area of the Marcellus and Southwest Pennsylvania in 2014 we are planning 5,200 foot laterals with 26 stage completions resulting in an average expected EUR of 13.4 Bcf. This is up significantly from 2013 which averaged 2,950 feet with 14 stages. And for 2015, the lateral lengths of today are identical to 2014. Although that EURs, lateral lengths and number of stages are updated in our investor presentation and we have upgraded the type curves and the economics to reflect our current plans for 2014 based on recent well performance in each of these areas.", "Again, I want to point out that we do expect that these lateral lengths will get longer and thereby resulting in higher EURs and higher returns as we continue to optimize those plans. We\u2019ve talked about improving capital efficiencies in the past and I would like to point out a tangible example of that occurring this year. And in Southwest Pennsylvania our plan is to go back on to five producing pads and drill approximately 14 more wells. Just in pad construction alone and not counting all the other already present infrastructure such as compression, gathering, watering roads for the well planned on most pads we estimate that will save over $200,000 per well just in pad construction alone.", "Even more importantly the real efficiency comes from the savings in time. We essentially save 9 to 12 months in preparation and permitting best brand new significant production volumes from these 14 wells online 9 to 12 months earlier. As we do this more and more over the coming years the increase in capital efficiencies will be significant, and this is a tangible example of just one of those improvements. There are many more factors that should also significantly improve our capital efficiency in value going forward.", "Just a few examples would be improved recoveries of hydrocarbon in place, better completion designs, longer laterals, closer space laterals, development of multiple horizons from the same pad and the list goes on and on, again making that inventory of resource potential more and more valuable return.", "Also of note, we are planning to drill a Point Pleasant well in what we believe is the core of the play underneath our Marcellus position in Washington County. The well should start this spring and the current plan would yield us production test prior to year end. Based on our expensive high quality 3D and Trenton/Black River test in the immediate area we already know a lot about the rock. The Point Pleasant is expected to be approximately 130 foot thick with around 10% porosity. Gas in place is expected to be as high as 140 Bcf or more per square mile and we expect around a 1,000 [indiscernible] exceptional year.", "We have strong indications that the reservoir pressure to be extremely high thereby resulting in really high gas in place and really high productive. And the TBD will be about 11,500 foot which is very workable. The plan is to drill a long lateral and complete it with an RCS style completion. We have all the ingredients for a highly productive well including thickness, the right maturity, very high gas in place, exceptional rock quality, high pressure, a 3D survey and a set of very reasonable and workable debt.", "Shifting to the Northern Marcellus the team continues to maintain our position while drilling some really impressive dry gas well as listed in our earnings release. For 2014, the division will average lateral length of 4,600 foot and 23 frac stages. The team recently brought on line a three new wells on a pad that together came to a little over 4 Bcf at 90 days. One of those wells have a lateral length of 6,300 and 53 feet with 32 stages, it\u2019s first 30 days production to sales averaged over 23 million a day, and it has a projected EUR of right at 18 Bcf. We have a 100% working interest and an NOI of 86% in that well. Again, we believe our position in Lycoming County is a prime dry gas area that is essentially HBP-ed and ready for us to ramp up when the time is right.", "In the Midcontinent division, we remain focused on delineating and testing our Mississippian Chat acreage on the Nemaha Ridge along with developing our St. Louis production in Texas Panhandle. For the Chat play we are continuing with our larger stimulation designs and those are updated in our investor presentation, while it\u2019s still early these results are encouraging, as we analyze our recent 3D data in the Oklahoma portion of the play, we expect to make good progress and developing our understanding of the reservoir and its delineation throughout 2014.", "For the Southern Appalachian division, the horizontal Huron shale wells drilled in 2013, where our best ever. The CVM wells continue to improve resulting in positive revisions, and a vertical tight gas sands wells continue to outperform our forecast in two of those wells, being the best we\u2019ve drilled to-date. The team continues to hold production on a minimal decline with very limited capital essentially holding production flat.", "In closing, 2013 was a great year and we have a plan that will make 2014 in many years into the future also great. Range has about 1 million net acreage and one of the best plays out there with a lot of that provision in the core of the highest hydrocarbon in place in the Appalachian basin. We believe we can execute as well as anyone and we have the people and the track record to support that belief. And we have a marketing and logistics team that\u2019s been innovative and class lean while positioning us to remain confident in our ability to consistently grow production 20% to 25% year-over-year and leverage shareholder growth in many years into the future.", "Now over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny", "", "Thank you Ray. Top line revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales for the fourth quarter, including cash-settled derivatives was $446 million, 7% higher than last year and 20% higher production volume. Cash margin for the quarter at $2.68 per Mcfe decrease slightly from the fourth quarter of last year due to much higher NGL realization and fourth quarter of last year, and lower realized prices for both gas and NGLs this year. Cash flow for the fourth quarter was $252 million, 2% higher than 2012, driven by higher production and continued expense control. Cash flow for fully diluted share was $1.56 slightly above last years fourth quarter of the year.", "And fourth quarter EBITDAX totaled $295 million, 2% higher than last year. Cash flow for all of 2013 totaled $943 million, a year-over-year increase of 25%, cash flow for fully diluted share for the year was $5.84, 24% increase from last year. EBITDAX for the whole year was $1.1 billion, 22% higher than 2012 and the first year our EBITDAX has broken through $1 billion mark. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $28 million while earnings calculated using analysts methodology, which excludes asset sales, derivative mark-to-market entries, and various non-recurring items was $68 million or $0.42 per fully diluted share.", "As Rodney mentioned both cash flow and per share earnings per share for the quarter exceeded consensus estimates. GAAP net income for all of 2013 totaled $116 million a nine fold increase from the 2012 net income figure of $13 million, all of our non-GAAP measures are fully reconciled to GAAP on the various supplemental tables posted to the Investor Relations section of our website.", "As evident in our 2013 financial performance whether one year\u2019s GAAP or non-GAAP measures as income and cash flow improvements in our capital and cost efficiency are clearly flowing through to the Range bottom line. One of the most visible indicators of improving capital efficiency is our DD&A rate per Mcfe. The DD&A is the most significant cost item flowing through the income statement and in the fourth quarter of each year we\u2019ve reached out our DD&A rate all in completion of our year end proved reserve.", "The DD&A rate for the fourth quarter of 2013 was a $1.36 per Mcfe down 7% from the $1.46 in the fourth quarter of last year. And as Ray and Jeff mentioned the DD&A rate is down 38% from 2009, not from ceiling test rate down, but from real improvement in capital efficiency, unproved property impairment for the quarter at $6 million was unusually light inflecting a year end true up.", "However we do expect this expense to be significantly lower in 2014 than prior years, with first quarter unproved property expense, coming in between $12 million and $14 million as we continued to block up and high grade our acreage positions. Likewise cash exploration expense for the fourth quarter at $13 million came in significantly below guidance as we experienced fewer dry holes and less delay rental expense than planned.", "The first quarter of 2014 reflecting a reloaded 2014 seismic budget, should see exploration expense return to the $17 million to $19 million range. All other quarterly expense items came in at or below guidance, although I should mentioned that unlike prior quarters, direct operating expense guidance is going to be flat to slightly higher in the first quarter of 2014 at $0.37 to $0.39 per Mcfe.", "A bit pause in the quarterly reduction again in operating expense is due primarily to the 24x7 shift coverage by our lease operators and improving weather conditions that Ray mentioned. We expect direct operating expense to resume its gradual drift downward after we get to the first quarter. Please reference our year-end 2013 press release for additional first quarter 2014 expense style of guidance.", "Our balance sheet at year-end was right on plan, with our trailing fourth quarter debt-to-EBITDAX ratio at 2.8 times that\u2019s down from the 3.2 times figure at year-end 2012. Leverage continues to decline as our cash flow grow outpaces our growth and leverage and with $500 million and bank debt outstanding we\u2019ve ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion an unused committed availability, under our $1.75 billion bank facility.", "Fourth quarter was another active quarter for hedging, thus Range adding natural gas, NGL and low hedges for 2014, 2015 and for the first time 2016. The Range website in press release tables contained detailed hedge volumes and prices, by product that investors may use in preparing their updated forecasts.", "In summary, 2013 reflected another year of improving unit costs and capital efficiency and holds a strong double-digit in our production and reserve growth. 2014 looks to be similar and off to a really good start. Higher natural gas price in two of our long-term NGL offtake contracts up and running [indiscernible]. Also unit cost continue to decrease while we project another year of steady production growth of between 20% and 25%.", "Jeff, over to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "", "Operator, let\u2019s open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Ventura. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Gil Yang with DISCERN. Please proceed with your question.", "Gil K. Yang \u2013 DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc.", "", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for all the details in the call. Jeff, growth clearly on track, cash flow is growing. Could you talk about what your expectations are for CapEx versus cash flow trends over the next several years?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, I mean we really feel comfortable with that 20% to 25% line of sight growth for many years. We have a big inventory. It\u2019s largely de-risked. You can look on the slides that talks about the percent of the wells were drilled upside in many different ways, either through incremental recovery, other horizons things like that. We feel comfortable we can grow 20% to 25% for many years. We talked about in the early years like we are now, we\u2019re getting the 20% to 25% growth with the cash flow outspend depending on where commodity prices are of between $250 million and $350 million. If you project forward a couple of years depending on where prices are we\u2019ll be getting 20% to 25% growth within cash flow.", "So, I think we\u2019re well-positioned, continue to grow consistently, and one of the highest rate of return, lowest-cost plays out there with a really strong team that has a great track record of delivering quarter-in, quarter out, year-in and year-out.", "Gil K. Yang \u2013 DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc.", "Great. If you just look at the strip, when would you get to that cash flow CapEx breakeven?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "It\u2019s hard to say. It might be in a couple of years or something like that. It depends where prices are ultimately be. I really think if you look forward, we\u2019re in a great position of where the strip is, but I think the good news, I think there\u2019s a lot upside in terms of gas. There\u2019s different studies out there about this company \u2013 quote a few of them and I\u2019m not picking any one company, but Goldman Sachs is saying 20 Bcf of reserve growth by 2018. Citi has 20 Bcf by 2020. There\u2019s other people out there.", "So, I think natural gas will be great in this current pricing environment where the strip is, but I think there\u2019s actually good upside to that because natural gas really is a superior fuel. A lot of things are happening, a lot of people are spending money on everything from converting more gas for power generation, LNG for export, gas for transportation, gas for manufacturing, gas for petrochemical business. So, a lot of upside out there.", "Gil K. Yang \u2013 DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc.", "Okay, great. And then, a follow-up in that context. With that 20% to 25% growth rate, you mentioned you could drill your Northeast gas at the right time. So, within the context of the pricing expectations in a 20%, 25% growth, what is the right time for that gas drilling to accelerate?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, we\u2019re drilling some of it right now. Ray mentioned some outstanding wells. One of them with 18 Bcf well from a reasonable length laterals 6,000 plus feet a little bit. So, I think we have good returns on that drilling now and the good news is we have a great inventory of dry projects, wet projects and super-rich projects. And we sort of have a portfolio within a portfolio and we can allocate capital where we think we can get the best returns as we go forward.", "Gil K. Yang \u2013 DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc.", "", "Do you need a specific price though to start accelerating versus what the liquids are doing right now?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, I think it comes back to 20% to 25% growth since \u2013 we think it\u2019s strong, particularly for a company our size. Every three to four years we\u2019ll be doubling 20% to 25%. So if we can double in three to four years and then double again for a company our size with the returns we have we think that\u2019s great. We are currently drilling some dry gas wells now both in the northeast and in the southwest. It will just become part of our portfolio.", "Gil K. Yang \u2013 DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.", "Neal D. Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "Good morning, gentlemen. Jeff, you\u2019ve obviously put on a lot of solid contracts with Mariner West and some with ATEX and some of these others, just tried coming on. Are there a number of additional ones that you\u2019re considering at this time or what\u2019s your thoughts as far as putting more of those going forward?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "", "I think we\u2019re in great shape. The marketing team, led by Chad and Greg and others, has done a great job. Again, I think our portfolio on the ethane side is good as any company I\u2019m aware of in the business really for any size. So what that does for us that plus all the firm takeaway, the 25 new customers and bringing gas really all over to the South, Southeast, to Mid-Atlantic, West, Northeast coupled with the ability to sell propane in the good markets or export in the summer when you can bring it to better markets, that\u2019s really cleared the path for us to get greater than 3 Bcf per day.", "So we\u2019re in a great position. We don\u2019t have to do anything to take our production to greater than 3 Bcf per day net and beyond. Our gas will be on spec, we\u2019d great contract, great prices. To the extent there\u2019s things that makes sense, clearly we\u2019ll continue to look at those things.", "Neal D. Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay. And then, you detailed, great detail about the longer laterals and how you come up with higher EURs. Just wondering on your thoughts, I mean I know there is some peers out there that are doing somewhere around your southwest PA, some of these monster laterals closer to 9,000 or even further. Your thoughts about going out, stepping out and try some of those. Are you going to still consider more around that 5,200 foot average?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, you\u2019ve kind of hit on it there in your last comment. I mean, the 5,200 foot is an average and so all those numbers that we\u2019re quoting to you and that we show you in the investor presentation is an average of literally 100 plus or minus wells that come online. So we have drilled some longer laterals and we do plan to reach out drilling longer laterals if it\u2019s appropriate. But again we\u2019re really focused on optimizing the recovery of hydrocarbon in place and a lot of that we focus on as EUR per 1,000 foot.", "Are we targeting the most optimum place in the zone, are we pumping the right size frac job, the right spacing between the per clusters. So we will continue to do like we\u2019ve done for the last several years and we\u2019ll update these curves as we go along. I think you\u2019ll see us continue to get longer and longer, but we don\u2019t wanted to get so long that we really cause our optimal recoveries of hydrocarbon in place to suffer.", "So we\u2019re going to really proceed along that line, just specifically data base, not outrun our technical understanding of the play. And I think right now in southwest PA for sure, our recoveries per 1,000 foot lateral class leading. We are proud of what the team has done there, Marcellus is a great rock, it\u2019s just getting better and better all of the improvements that we are making, the adjustments that we make year-over-year are getting as higher recoveries, and I expect those to continue to go up with sometime.", "I still think we are in the early innings of the ball game and being able to optimize that, and I think that\u2019s completely different than we\u2019ve seen in a lot of other shale plays, and [indiscernible] have some of the other ones that have a lot more history. We\u2019ve seen like we got through the bargain pretty quick in a lot of those, and it was just simply stack in laterals closer together. I think we got a lot of efficiencies and improvements to be going forward, and I think that a lot of that has to do with the fact that we are in a very core of the sweet spot in Southwest PA. And then of course, when you stack through upper development in Utica, up and top and below that, we got even more efficiencies that we can get over the years to come.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Now I think having a large foot print in the core of the best play out there with really strong technical team I totally agree with Ray that we ought to be able to continue to improve with time.", "Neal D. Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Hey Ray, just as one follow-on to that if I could, just you mentioned about the stack pay and obvious to gas in place math really show that you have a lot of Utica potential, just the sort of cautious approach by maybe not drilling the first there until spring. Is that more a result of just how good your current Marcellus results there or why not obviously just ramp that up quicker on the Utica side if certainly if those gas in place not so as good as they are showing?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr.", "Well, we HBP everything as when we drill Marcellus, so it\u2019s been a really a matter of focus on the Marcellus. We are making really good at project economics there. We are seeing improvements year-over-year. We\u2019ve known that Utica is there for sometime, I think there has been wells drilled closer to as we got lot more 3D together, and over the years, it sort of always been there, people tend to forget, we actually drilled the very first horizontal Utica well as we drilled back in 2009.", "So, we\u2019ve been working on it longer than anybody. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve been focused on the Marcellus, and I think with the data we have today, I think the timing is right, I think the team has put together some really good technical work. We are really excited about this project, I don\u2019t know if you could tell that or not, when we are [indiscernible], but it\u2019s going to be, I think a great well and we have taken our time, we got prepared for it.", "We actually believe we can bring this well online pretty quickly after we test it and that\u2019s critically important. We don\u2019t like to have wells sitting around waiting on the infrastructures, so I think that we are really excited about it, and we think it has the potential to be hugely economic, and a great play that we can really ramp in and develop in as the years go forward. But again it\u2019s going to be HBP and as it fits into our plan, I think we are just kind of see us do more and more evidence as the years go forward.", "Neal D. Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "All great points. Thanks Ray.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Holly Stewart with Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question.", "Holly Stewart \u2013 Howard Weil", "Good morning gentleman.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Good morning.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil", "Hoping to dig a little bit more into the NGL marking side, given your expectations for increased volumes through this three-pronged NGL marking strategies have begun operations. So, can we maybe use January and February as an example of how the realizations are changing, and then maybe a little color on your outlets and how you use them thus far?", "Chad L. Stephens", "Holly thanks, this is Chad, I will try to give a little bit color on that, so in January beginning of January this year, we were flowing 15,000 barrels a day of ethane on MarkWest and approximately 10,000 Mariner West and that\u2019s gross. And about 10,000 barrels a day gross on ATEX. The MarkWest pricing is tied more to Appalachia index price and ATEX is more of a true Mont Belvieu price less the transportation cost. So, if Mont Belvieu prices in January, they had a little jump up or increase in price. So, they were around $0.39 or $0.40. We see that going forward into later end of the year and in 2015 coming back down to a more historical average. Price were around $0.30 a gallon. That\u2019s the Mont Belvieu index price before index, before transportation deduct.", "But really what you need to look at is going into 2015, once all three projects are in service we\u2019re delivering 15,000 barrels to MarkWest, NOVA, 10,000 barrels a day to ATEX to Mont Belvieu and then 10,000 barrels a day on Mariner East, which has a more European a Napa-based index price. All three of those gives you that 25% uplift and we get a deeper cut. The more ethane we take out of the gas we get a deeper cut of propane, which again gives us a little bit more uplift on our overall NGL realization.", "So, you really need to look at it that way. Current prices January and February for ethane are up, because gas prices have moved up and ethane will follow that full price of gas, but going forward you need to look at really the 2015 portfolio of all three projects and service.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil", "", "Perfect. That's helpful. And then, maybe on the basis. Looks like $0.22 during the quarter, but then Appalachian prices have moved up in the first quarter. So, can you just give us a sense of how this is evolving maybe in the first quarter compared to 4Q and then your execution throughout the year?", "Roger S. Manny", "", "Yes, and what I really like to do is address. I know there\u2019s a lot of people on the call that probably have \u2013 want to know what our thoughts are and want to just get some color on basis differential. So, I\u2019ll kind of try to address that more generally. As Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks, the basis differentials don't impact all producers equally. Especially that's true in the Appalachian basis, Appalachian basis, notably very depending on which pipes you\u2019re delivering into or which markets or producers you have access to. So, if you look at our supplemental tables it shows corporate gas prices, third quarter 2013 differentials of 17 units and fourth quarter of 2013 was minus $0.22 per Mcf, but if you drill down a little bit and to give a little color on that, if you look at a subset of that corporate differential and just look at our Marcellus differentials, it improves quite a bit.", "For example, in third quarter 2013 our Marcellus gas price differentials to NYMEX was minus $0.06 and in fourth quarter 2013 it was minus $0.11. So, that should give a little bit of context going forward of what we\u2019re doing with our Marcellus gas, and how to use firm transportation arrangements out of the basins are really helping us.", "A majority of our acreage in production is in the Southwest portion of PA near large and already existing pipeline such as TECO in Columbia. We have great relationships with them. It gives us access to multiple markets. And as Jeff and Ray have both reported, we currently have 1.1 Bcf either firm transportation or firm sales in place. You want to add into 2016. We have 1.6 Bcf of firm transported firm sales. These arrangements allow us to supply as much as 50% to 60% of our gas to multiple consuming regions outside the basin and Jeff talked about some of those regions of Gulf coast, we have great arrangements on TECO in Columbia to get our gas to the Gulf coast in the Southeast.", "Midwest, the Ohio Valley where there is lots of \u2013 we have great relationships with power and utility users, so that\u2019s a key area for us and as well as the Mid-Atlantic area and this percentage could increase in future years with a lot of flexibility we have on our upfront transport.", "So, and also Ray mentioned we worked hard to add 25 new customers and create strong relationships with these power and industrial users outside the Appalachia basin. And we\u2019ve been successful in doing that. There is no question that likely there will be challenges due to the volatility in the market between now and probably late 2016 with demand, we see demand increasing, but we\u2019ll continue to use this strategy that we\u2019d use in the past to diversify our pricing and expand our capacity in markets and number of customers using our portfolio firm transportation and these relationships that we have.", "So, really back to your question, what do we think basis is going forward? We understand the importance of that, Range doesn\u2019t typically give guidance on any specific commodity pricing particularly basis. It\u2019s really because of the high volatility and you have seen that of late. In addition, the current dynamics and going forward the volatility in the gas markets is constantly changing, so it\u2019s difficult to give any specific guidance on particular basis of pricing. But what I can tell you and the shareholders is that we are diversifying our risk, our team has done a great job and are continuing to do a great job out there and we are well prepared from a gas marketing standpoint. Thanks.", "Holly Stewart - Howard Weil", "Perfect, thanks gentlemen.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice. Please proceed with your question.", "Ronald E. Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Good morning guys. A couple of real quick questions. Should we view as you move to both longer laterals and drilling more wells off of exiting pads including currently producing pads? Is 2014 more of a transition year in terms of the cycle times pushing some of the growth more to the second, third and fourth quarters, so later in the year, but then in 2015 and beyond, is it something that we can start looking at as more moving into acceleration mode, is that a fair way to look at your points?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr.", "Well Ron this is Ray, the \u2013 I mean part of that I could say is every year we\u2019ve consistently drilled a little bit longer laterals and we\u2019ve done more and more things like going back to existing pads and testing 500 foot space laterals and RCS completions and so, every year I think we\u2019ve made steady improvements. I think that recent couple of years certainly we\u2019ve seen more of those, have larger impacts, and I think that will continue at least for a few more years I think. As far as acceleration we are going to grow 20% and 25% per year for as far as we can see out there and that essentially seems pretty aggressive to me and that\u2019s doubling, for three years, so there is an operation that grows year-over-year a couple of years out is huge.", "So that\u2019s certainly accelerating from where we are at today, if you want to look at it that way. So I think that\u2019s going to happen now as far as production seeming to always be back-end loaded. There is a simple fact in Appalachia that we can\u2019t mess with Mother Nature, if we could figure out how to warm her up, in January and February we wouldn\u2019t have these six week periods that we have consistently every year, where it\u2019s just simply hard to frac period one is negative degree, known as negative 15, negative 20 degrees, even 10 pound salt water freezes solid, so you just can\u2019t complete wells during that time.", "There are control lines on compressors that will freeze up, there are things like that that will always happen when it gets that cold. As much planning as we do and my hats off to our operations teams. They have absolutely done better every year that goes along, but I don\u2019t think, we are ever going to a point where we can just sell right through. The really cold weather in January and February is a blessing and we certainly are very appreciative this year that we had cold weather and polar vortex storms and all that, especially since I don\u2019t have to live in Pittsburgh any more, it\u2019s really great. But the fact that it is cold, it\u2019s hard to have operations going consistently through January and February, and it\u2019s going to be that way forever.", "So, I think you are always going to see the first quarter down. We forecast and in our numbers, we\u2019ve done that as far back as I remember. And it\u2019s going to always be that way. So, I think that is just part of it. But did I tell you about those super-rich wells that we\u2019ve been drilling lately. It has turned really well, [indiscernible].", "Ronald E. Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "", "And then, when you talk about the going back existing producing pads, one just to make sure I understood, will you go back to five currently producing pads this year and drilling 14 more wells. I am assuming the 14 is an aggregate number. I guess number one, and then number two, you had the excitement or the description of why you\u2019re so excited about the Utica on your acreage, came through loud and clear. But do any of \u2013 are you also doing any other stack pay test? Are you continuing to test Upper Devonian and some of these areas, and/or is that part of what you\u2019re going to do on some of these producing pads, you go back into?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "", "Well the 14 wells is an aggregate number that is across all five pads of 3,4,5 wells pad kind of thing. The Utica is \u2013 we are very excited about it. We just have \u2013 we just have the one well this year, of course we want to drill it. We want to test it, put it production, analyze it, optimize our plans from that point. And so, it\u2019s going to take us a while to see that.", "The Upper Devonian, we got figured it out. We drilled enough wells, every time we drill in Marcellus well, we go through it. So, we\u2019ve got hundreds and hundreds of wells worth of information about it. There are now enough Upper Devonian test all around our acreage not even including ours that certainly have delineated and really de-risk that. To us it\u2019s more simply a fact of focus on the Marcellus. And let\u2019s continue to optimize that and I do believe at some point we will start putting Upper Devonian wells on the same pad as we get into that. Once, if you want to refer to it as a manufacturing mode, when we more or less drill all the wells on a pad whether that is 10, 20, 30 wells whatever that is. Eventually going forward, I think you\u2019ll see that more and more starting to occur over the next several years.", "Ronald E. Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Great, thank you for the information.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "", "Thank you, Ron.", "", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Jack Aydin with Keybanc. Please proceed with your question.", "Jack N. Aydin \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "", "Hey, guys.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Hello, Jack.", "Jack N. Aydin \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Good morning. Could you \u2013 I know you\u2019ve been talking about uplift. If you have all the ethane projects on a play [ph] and you\u2019re talking about 25% uplift in revenue. Could you put a circle around what could mean that to the cash flow potential? I\u2019m sure you modeled it.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, I mean I\u2019ll turn it over to Roger and Chad in a minute. This is Jeff. I think one things is, when those things online, again to Jack\u2019s point, extracting the ethane, once all three projects are up, there\u2019s a 25% uplift relative to leaving it in the gas stream. So for the analysts and investors that run NAV models or whatever, clearly you\u2019re going to add significant NAV when you model that in for a particular year. One of the other thing I\u2019ll say too, I think we did a great job in 2013. We said we grow 20%, 25% and we did almost every metric you look at including cash flow or cash flow per share debt-adjusted reserves production, all drill in that range. In fact we hit the high end of the range. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Roger or Chad for any additional color you want to add.", "Ray N. Walker", "", "Jack, I think when you look at our cash flow growth, it really has twinned our production reserve growth fairly well and this has been a pretty good year last year in terms of comparison. While NGL prices were down fairly significantly, gas prices and oil were pretty \u2013 pretty much offset each other. So you saw really 25% cash flow growth in 2013 with relatively flat to down prices. So I think as you start pulling ethane and particularly when, as Chad mentioned, the 2015 enhancements come into play on Mariner East, I think you\u2019ll continue to see cash flow grow in somewhat per well fashion with our production and reserves.", "Chad L. Stephens", "If you look out there far enough and depending on what prices do, it could even grow in excess of that if you go out a few years, which is pretty exciting.", "Jack N. Aydin \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Second question for you is basically on your budget. You allocated about $210 million for leasehold and renewals. Could you break it down or to \u2013 second, instead of drilling to hold leases on production, now you are renewing it and paying the money? Is that what you are doing? Could you explain it a little bit?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, Jack, it\u2019s a good question. The majority of that is driven of course by the Marcellus. We have 1 million net acres plus or minus there and a lot of that is still in progress of HBP. So it\u2019s just what I would call normal blocking and tackling. It's filling in holes. It's bolting on things to units. It's renewals. It's all of those things that you just mentioned. So we\u2019ll see that taper off. In the future, there's no question about that. We\u2019re getting closer and closer. Our at-risk acreage is becoming a very, very low number. We show that in our investor presentation. And so, we\u2019re doing a much \u2013 we\u2019ve made great strides, I would put it that way, in holding as many as four units worth of acreage from one surface location and it gives us not only a lot of operational and capital efficiencies, but it's very efficient at HBP and land.", "So we\u2019re feeling really good about that. So I think we have a very large acreage position and just normal blocking and tackling, it's going to be that way, but the good news is, there's at least one good leading indicator that we\u2019re seeing in the 10-K. We look at expiration expense. You\u2019re seeing that crest over and come down. So I think that\u2019s our excellent leading indicator, and that shows us that and we are about to get to that point where it comes over, Southwest PA has a lot of small tracks and it just simply going to take us sometime to fill in all of the little puzzle pieces but we do \u2013 we\u2019re feeling really good about that.", "Jack N. Aydin \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thank you, very much.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We are nearing the end of today\u2019s conference. We will go to Phillips Johnston of Capital One for our final question.", "Phillips Johnston \u2013 Capital One Securities, Inc.", "Hey, guys thanks. Just on the first Utica Point Pleasant well. I\u2019m wondering if you can say what the ASE might be, and what sort of cost for signs that might include, and given the depth and the pressure what sort of average well cost would you expect in the full development pad drilling mode. And just as a follow-up to the earlier question that Ray answered, if you like what you see there, how many wells, do you think you could feasibly drill looking at in the next year?", "Roger S. Manny", "Well, the first set of questions on all the detail is no, no, no, and no. The first well, we can\u2019t really talk about the first well. We build a lot of insurance in there. We do a lot of things. From a science standpoint, it is our very first well, the way we tend to look at things like that is on a project basis, is just like any exploration project. Let\u2019s go drill the first well, let\u2019s look at it. The question is in a development mode if it all test out, will it make sense. And all our numbers, what I can\u2019t say is, it looks really, really good, with the high pressure, high gas, it\u2019s in a very workable depth.", "We got a large position, we know we are in the core from a lot of \u2013 we have actual Trenton/Black River test with well logs, lot of modern scientific catalogs right in the area. We have infracture on the surface where we can put some of these well on line early on, so it\u2019s a pretty exciting projects. It\u2019s something again, we\u2019ve been working on since literally back in 2008 and 2009. So I think this first well with lot it\u2019s a little early to say would we drill another one in 2015 or 2016, when would it be. But if we did a good test by the end of the year and things look good, I could definitely see us drilling the second or maybe third well in 2015, but certainly in 2016.", "From that point forward I think it\u2019s just a matter of when it make sense to ramp that up and it gives us some other great option. Again, we control our own destiny, we don\u2019t have a lot of JV partners. We got great marketing and commercial logistics for the area, got a lot of takeaway capacity and we think it\u2019s got a huge potential for us going forward\u2026", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And the wells drill \u2013 will be drill of in existing Marcellus?", "Roger S. Manny", "Yes, I add and there is room for additional wells, so it could really be great upside for us.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr.", "I was going to say, plus it\u2019s really easy to build volumes quickly with dry gas, so with big wells like that it just gives us a lot of good options in the future.", "Phillips Johnston \u2013 Capital One Securities, Inc.", "And just as a follow-up to Ron\u2019s question earlier, are there any Upper Devonian wells that are planned in this year\u2019s capital budget?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr.", "No, we currently don\u2019t have any plans right now in the schedules.", "Phillips Johnston \u2013 Capital One Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for closing comments.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Range had a great year in 2013 and we expect another great year in 2014, given our approximately 1 million acre position in Pennsylvania focused in the Southwest portion of the state whether there is great stack pay potential and because we have a great portfolio of dry, wet and super-rich wells, we believe we can continue to grow at 20% to 25% for many years.

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question and answer period. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources.", "Rodney Waller", "Good afternoon and welcome. The results for the second quarter of 2009 leading the consensus number and clearly continuing to execute our business plan for 2009. In trying to be transparent as possible, but still maintain our competitive advantages, Ranger shared a tight curve of our first 24 horizontal wells in the Marcellus that have had at least 120 days of production history.", "We've also compared our Marcellus results with various other shelf plays pulling that data from existing public data. Both Jeff and John will give more color on our Marcellus results today on the call.", "On the call with me today are John Pinkerton, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Ventura, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Roger Manny, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Before turning the call over to John, I'd like to cover a few administrative items. First, we did file our 10-Q with the SEC this morning. It's now available on the home page of our website or you can access it using the SEC's anchor system.", "Also available on the home page is the slide showing our Marcellus tight curve and comparison of other shale plays. In addition, we've posted on our website supplemental tables which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBIDAX and cash margins and the reconciliation of our non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today.", "Tables are also posted on the website that will give you detailed information on our current hedge position by quarter.", "Second, we will be participating in several conferences and road shows in the upcoming weeks. Check our website for a complete listing of those in the next several months. We will be at Enercom's Oil and Gas conference in Denver on August 10 and 11, the Energy Forum in Houston on August 18 and 19 and Barclay's CEO Energy Conference on September 9 and 10 in New York.", "Now let me turn the call over to John.", "John Pinkerton", "Before Roger reviews the second quarter financial results, I'll review the key accomplishments for the second quarter. On a year over year basis, second quarter production rose 14%, meeting the high end of the guidance by almost 10 million a day. This also marks our 26th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth.", "The driver for the higher than anticipated production was some exception drilling results both in the Barnett and the Marcellus shelf plates. Our drilling program was on schedule throughout the quarter as we drove 145 wells. We continue to be extremely pleased with the drilling results and in despite the low prices, continue to generate attractive rates of return.", "Currently, we've got about 14 rigs running which is down about a half from where we were last year when we had about 30 running. The 14% increase in production was more than offset by a 32% decrease in realized prices. As a result, second quarter financial results were lower than the previous year.", "We're most pleased on the cost side as our controllable costs were well in line with expectations. Unit operating costs came in at $0.86 per mcfe. That's 18% lower than the second quarter of last year.", "Right at the quarter end we closed the sale of our Furman property in West Texas for $182 million. We received an excellent price for the property and will recycle the proceeds into a higher return projects.", "As I've said before, we view asset sales as a way to fund our capital program, hydrate our asset base, maintain our low cost structure and focus our technical teams on our higher return projects. I want to congratulate Chad Stevens and his team for excellent work they did on the Furman sale.", "With regard to our Marcellus self plate, significant headway was made in the quarter as we continue drill some terrific wells, hydrate our acreage position, build out infrastructure and bring down our oil cost. In addition, we continue to add some high quality technical personnel to our growing Marcellus team in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.", "All in all, I couldn't be more pleased with how much we've accomplished so far in the year. It's a real testimony to the entire Range team. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger to review our financial results.", "Roger Manny", "The second quarter of 2009 bears many similarities to the first quarter this year as oil and gas production set a new record high, up 14% from the second quarter of last year. Direct operating costs were down significantly and our liquidity and balance sheets were stronger at the end of the quarter than at the beginning. ", "Unfortunately all of these favorable items occurred against the backdrop of continued lower oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices on an mcfe basis were 32% or $2.85 lower than the second quarter of last year. Quarterly oil and gas sales including derivatives totaled $244 million, down 22% from the $313 million in revenues last year. As John mentioned, the 32% drop in prices, more than offset the 14% increase in production.", "As we will discuss further in a moment, upward costs were significantly lower this quarter; in fact, the lowest since 2007. Cash flow for the second quarter of '09 was $156 million. That's 29% below the second quarter of 2008. Cash flow per share for the quarter totaled $0.98, $0.02 per share higher than the analysts' consensus estimate of $0.96.", "Quarterly income tax of $185 million was 25% lower than the $244 million earned in the second quarter of '08. Second quarter cash margins were $3.93 per mcfe compared to $6.37 per mcfe in 2008.  While cash expenses per mcfe were down an impressive $0.39 or 14% from last year, these savings were overshadowed by the decline in oil and gas prices.", "Mark to market hedge accounting drove a $62 million non cash market loss in the second quarter compared to a loss of $162 million last year. Another non cash revenue item worth mentioning is a $4.6 million loss on our equity investment primarily at 50% investment in an Appalachian drilling company.", "Skipping to the bottom line for a minute before discussing our cost performance, quarterly earnings are calculated using analyst's consensus methodology in the second quarter of this year were $34 million or $0.21 per fully diluted share. That's $0.03 higher than the analyst's consensus of $0.18.", "The GAAP net loss for the quarter was $40 million compared to a net loss of $32 million last year. As Rodney mentioned, the Resources website contains a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures including cash flow and EBIDAX in cash margins.", "The expense categories for the second quarter of '09 reveal the impact of lower oil and gas prices as a resulting reduced demand for services. Cash direct operating unit cost was $0.86 per mcfe in the second quarter of '09. That's $0.07 lower than the first quarter this year and an impressive $0.19 per mcfe lower than the $1.05 figure unit cost in the second quarter of last year.", "Work over expenses were $0.02 per mcfe. That's $0.08 lower than last year, and that accounted for some of the decrease. As I mentioned earlier, the last time cash direct operating costs were this low was back in 2007.", "Production and oil taxes per mcfe were 53% lower than last year's second quarter and that reflects lower oil and tax prices. Production taxes totaled $0.19 per mcfe for the second quarter of '09. That's compared to $0.46 last year. We expect direct operating costs to be in the mid to high $0.80 range for the rest of the year.", "General and administrative expense adjusted for non cash stock compensation was $0.51 per mcfe. That's up $0.01 from last quarter and up $0.02 from the second quarter of last year. The area where G&A expenses are increasing is in the continued build out of our Marcellus shale division.", "With the Marcellus production now growing concurrently with the G&A expense, we are beginning to see the rate of G&A unit cost expense growth begin to moderate and cash G&A expense is anticipate to be in the $0.53 to $0.56 per mcfe range for the rest of '09 as we staff up for 2010 Marcellus development.", "Interest expense for the second quarter of '09 was $0.75 per mcfe. That's up $0.04 from the first quarter and up $0.0o6 from the $0.69 figure last year. The extra pressure on interest expense stems from our decision to refinance $300 million in short term floating rate bank debt with longer term fixed rate subordinated notes during this quarter.", "Exploration expense for the second quarter of '09 excluding non cash stock compensation was $10.5 million, and this expense was $8 million below last year with the reductions being evenly split between lower drive home costs and lower seismic expense. That's somewhat unusual in this business even for Range that had not drive holes in the entire quarter as we did this quarter, but expect exploration expense to return probably to the $12 million to $14 million range per quarter for the rest of the year.", "Depletion, depreciation and amortization per mcfe for the quarter was $2.25, even with the first quarter and $0.17 higher than the $2.08 figure from second quarter last year. $2.10 of the $2.25 figure is from depletion. $0.15 is from depreciation and amortization of our other assets. Our DD&A rate should remain at or just slightly above the $2.25 figure for the rest of the quarter.", "On the first quarter conference call, I explained the nature of the unproved property account and how the impairment and abandoned process works, and I stated that the expense figure would continue to vary quarter to quarter and our best estimate of future quarterly non cash expense was in the $16 million to $19 million range.", "Since the second quarter of 2009 impairment and abandonment figure was $41 million, the first half of my prediction about the number varying was clearly correct, but the second half was off. $22 million of the $41 million provision for impairment relates to Barnett leases where we elected not to renew the leases due to marginal economics at today's prices.", "The remaining $19 million amount represents a combination of our regular amortization and provision for specifically identified leases that we believe should be impaired by some current economic conditions.", "Because so many of you have asked questions about this unproved property process and the unproved property impairments, I would like to again revisit the issue this quarter, but instead of explaining the detail of the unproved property process, I will focus at the macro level this time.", "Range is one of the only major shale resource players to use this successful method of accounting for oil and gas properties. This is significant in that there are major differences in how these accounting methods treat the disposition of undeveloped leasehold, or what accountants call unproved properties. One difference is that delay rental and other costs to hold unproved properties are expensed under successful efforts but capitalized under full cost.", "The more significant difference however, is what happens to unproved properties when they are impaired or abandoned. Under successful efforts, once an unproved property is deemed to be impaired for any reason, whether it's a dry hole drilled on the property or the property next door or a cut in your exploration budget, or just marginal projected economics due to declining oil and gas prices, these things happen, you must immediately take the impairment against earnings.", "Full cost producers on the other hand do not expense the impairment even if the property is impaired to the point of being worthless. An impaired, unproved property under full cost rules is transferred from the unproved property account to the full cost pool where it becomes part of the amortization base and is depleted through DD&A based on units of production.", "In effect, this spreads the costs of worthless acreage over the producing life of the full cost pool of assets, resulting in a higher ongoing DD&A rate, but no one time charge. This is very similar to the way full cost accounting method handles dry holes. They're not expensed as they occur, but amortized over time as part of the full cost pool.", "The day of reckoning for full costers of course is the quarterly ceiling test which uses strict point in time oil and gas prices to test these capitalized costs in the full cost pool against the calculated net present value. The 10 full cost shale companies posted an aggregate pre tax ceiling test impairment at year end '08 of $27 billion and an additional $25 billion in the first quarter.", "Embedded in this $52 billion of write offs are previously capitalized dry holes and impaired acreage. These non cash charges are largely ignored by investors as an inevitable by-product of the full cost accounting rules, yet because so few shale players use the successful efforts accounting, similar yet much, much smaller non cash impairments seen unusual and out of place.", "Southwestern Energy for example, a full cost company we admire greatly that has shown to everybody how to properly execute a shale play had a $907 million pre tax property impairment in the first quarter this year. So not being familiar with the nuances of the accounting rules, one could easily come to the false conclusion that a successful efforts company like Range would continue an unproved property impairment, must have inferior acreage to a full cost company without such impairments, or that acreage impairment by a successful efforts company should be treated differently than a ceiling test write down by a full cost company.", "This is clearly not the case. There are two companies besides Range that are significant shale players and use the successful efforts accounting method. They're EOG and Cabot. There are $41 million provision for unproved properties this quarter if consistent with historical impairment figures reported by these other companies.", "We continue to believe that the totally provision for unproved property impairment will run in the $16 million to $19 million range but this amount will vary based on a myriad of factors many of which remain outside of our control.", "Range recorded a benefit of $23 million in deferred taxes for the second quarter and we recorded $619,000 in State level cash income taxes, and while producing no book gain or loss, the successful sale of the Furman properties resulted in an approximate gain for tax purposes of $140 million.", "Range will shield this gain using deductions from this year's drilling program such that our $160 million NOL carry forward will not be reduced. Range is essentially fully hedged for the remainder of '09, with approximately 80% of our gas production hedged at the full price of $7.49 per mbpu.", "Early in the second quarter of this year, we began to layer in hedges on our 2010 gas production. We now have collars in place covering approximately 47% of the first half of 2010 production at the full price of $5.50 per mbpu and a ceiling of $7.44. We have approximately 24% of our second half 2010 production hedges at collars of $5.50 by $7.50 per mbpu.", "There are several good news items from the balance sheet this quarter as we ended the quarter with a lower debt to cap ratio than we started, and we successfully achieved $300 million on 10 year, 8% senior sub notes at a yield of 8 3/4. As a measure of Range's standing in the credit markets, these notes have been the only 10 year note qualified notes issued by a high yield A&P company this year, and we're the first 10 year note qualified subordinated notes issued by any high yield issue in any industry this year.", "The 8 3/4% yield is the lowest that any year to day double B E&P issuer, regardless of maturity or structure. The combination of the $300 million note issuance and receipt of the proceeds of the Furman asset sale reduced our bank debt balance to $403 million, down from $807 million at the end of the first quarter.", "The $403 bank debt balance provides Range with over $1 billion in unused borrowing base capacity and approximately $850 million from liquidity.", "Looking back on the second quarter of '09, Range delivered better than expected operating results, and another double digit quarter of production growth and significantly lower operating costs. The successful asset sale completed during the quarter, combined with the $300 million note issuance, strengthened the balance sheet and more than doubled our liquidity cushion; both good things to accomplish in this business environment.", "John, I'll turn the call back to you.", "John Pinkerton", "Let's now turn the call over to Jeff to review our operations.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "I'll begin by reviewing production. For the second quarter production averaged 444 million cubic feet equivalent per day, a 14% increase over the second quarter of 2008. This represents the highest quarterly production rate in the company's history, and the 26th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth.", "Looking forward, continuing this streak will be a challenge. We closed on the sale of our Furman properties right at the end of the second quarter so our net volumes in the third quarter will be reduced by about 15 million per day.", "I'll begin the operating update with the Marcellus shale and the Appalachian basin. To date, Range has drilled and completed 46 horizontal Marcellus shale wells. 41 of those wells are currently online and today we're producing over 50 million cubic feet equivalent per day net. ", "24 of those wells have been producing for more than 120 days and some for almost two years. Utilizing these 24 wells for the first time, we've released what our tight curve is for the average expected ultimate recovery of these wells. The expected gross ultimate recovery for this type well is 4.4 bcfe.", "Our current cost to drill and complete one of these wells in southwest Pennsylvania from a multi-well pad is $3.5 million. Through a wet gas case, after processing the btu content of the gas is 1,150. We currently get paid for the btu's, therefore our gas price is NYMEX times 9.15 plus $0.28 since this gas still receives a premium for NYMEX because of it's location in the Appalachian basin. Our average royalty here is 15%.", "Economics for Range's average southwest Pennsylvania Marcellus shell well to date; we spent $3.5 million to get $4.4 bcfe. Factoring in the production profile which is shown on our website, our average royalty and current gas price adjustments and assuming a $5.00 premium btu gas price, results in a 50% rate of return and a cost of find and develop of $0.95 per mcfe. At $7.00 gas, the rate of return increases to 79%. We believe this is the best rate of return and finding costs of any large scale, repeatable play in the United States. ", "In the past, I've stated that the average reserve expectation across our acreage position is in the three to four bcfu range. To day, our average well has been about 4.4 bcfe which is above the top end of that range.", "I must caution that more wells and more production are necessary to determine what the actual number will be. We're still very early in the development of this play. For now, I'm still comfortable with the three to four bcfu range for the expanse of our acreage.", "In the southwestern part of the play we have approximately 550,000 net acres. To date we have drilled and complete 108 wells in this area. 46 of these wells are horizontal wells and all were successful excluding the initial science wells.", "The distance between our northern and southernmost horizontal Marcellus shell wells in southwest Pennsylvania is 40 miles. The distance between our eastern and westernmost horizontal shell well in southwestern Pennsylvania is 41 miles. Within this box we have 173,000 net acres or 32% of our 550,000 net acres in the part of the play.", "Of course we feel very strongly about this area. We consider it low risk and have moved it into the commercial development of this area. In the same area, the distance between the industry's northern and southernmost wells is 81 miles. The industry's easternmost and westernmost wells in southwest Pennsylvania is 59 miles.", "Within this box, Range has 380,000 net acres or 69% of our 550,000 net acres in southwest Pennsylvania. Approximately 250 industry wells, including Range's wells have been drilled in and around Range's acreage which has significantly derisk even more of Range's acreage.", "Using just the 380,000 net acres within this low risk, high chance of success area, in essence the derisk box and assuming 80% of the acreage is ultimately drilled, and assuming 80 acres facing, we can potentially drill 3,800 horizontal wells. Assuming 3.5 tcfe per well, that's 13.3 tcfe growth or 11.3 tcfe net unrisk reserve potential for Range.", "Range is currently a 2.7 tcf company; therefore we have the potential to grow significantly from just this play and just this area. Importantly, the rate of return on this capital expenditure is exceptional.", "In the part of the play, we have an additional 350,000 net acres. This represents another five to seven tcfe of unrisk reserve potential for Range. By the end of August, we'll be studding the first of two back to back horizontal wells in the northeast. Both horizontal wells offset excellent vertical wells that were previously drilled and tested.", "We also see significant upside in both the Utica shoal and upper Livonia shale on portions of our acreage. We currently plan to spud two horizontal wells to test each of these concepts by year end. At year end 2007, Range's Marcellus production was about either million per day net. At year end 2008 we were producing about 26 million per day. At year end 2009 we will be producing between 90 and 100 million a day and we currently plan on doubling that to 180 to 200 million per day by 2010.", "Future growth beyond that looks very encouraging. By late this year, early next year, we expect to have 200 million a day in process and capacity. We've just recently announced adding an additional 120 million per day of process and capacity which will bring our total capacity when installed, up to 320 million per day.", "We have a first class mid stream and marketing group and I'm confident that they'll keep ahead of our drilling team. ", "I wanted to take some time to discuss our capital efficiency, where we've been in the past and where I believe we'll be in the future. According to a Bank of America study, considering the all in cost structure, Range has either been the lowest cost producer in our peer group or the second lowest cost producer for the last five years in a row.", "When Range was first, Southwestern was second. When Range was second, Southwestern was first. The five year time frame that I'm referring to here is 2004, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Today, Range's top three projects are the Marcellus shale, and the Barnett shale. Over the last five years, these projects played a very different role than the role they'll play going forward.", "Over the last five years, the Marcellus shale either insignificantly or negatively impacted these numbers. The reason is that our first test of Marcellus was in 2004. Our early efforts involved pioneering deploying, exploratory and delineation drilling, experimentation, data gathering and acquiring land.", "Once we found commercial gas, we began to go up a learning curve and finding ways to improve production and reserves and just recently, this year in particular, began to drive down costs. 2009 is a watershed year for us and as the first major processing plant that was installed in late 2008, allowing us to begin development pad drilling this year.", "Pad drilling, coupled with new specially designed rigs allowed us to achieve development wells that currently cost $3.5 million to drill and complete. Over the last five years, the Marcellus exploratory/delineation/land grab/science project has been a drag on our operating results. Given the success that Range has had in discovering this field and pioneering this project, the Marcellus now has become the premier shell play with what we believe are the best economic and largest upside of any upside in the United States, or for that matter, in the world.", "Going forward, the low F&B, low LOE and premium to NYMEX to keep Range in the best or one of the best low cost high organic growth companies in the business.", "The same is true of our other two plays, the Barnett shell and Nora. Range didn't start drilling in the Barnett until mid year 2006. Our first full year of drilling was in 2007. In the five year Bank of America study references previously, the first three years, 2003, 4, 5 and 6, included zero or minimal impact from the Barnett.", "The last two years, 2007, 2008 did include Barnett drilling, and included in that was our effort to push the play south into southern Johnson County and further south in Hill County in an effort also to push it east into Ellis County. Although we were successful at finding gas in the Barnett, these areas are outside of what is now the well defined core of the Barnett.", "These areas have a significantly higher F&B cost and significantly lower rate of return than the core of the Barnett. Beginning in 2009, all of Range's drilling will be in the core. This area has a much lower cost structure and therefore we expect the next five years will have a much better cost structure going forward that the previous five years.", "We have over 1,000 locations left to drill in the core. Nora should also have a much more significant impact on keeping Range's cost structure down in the future than in the past. There are three reasons for this.", "The first is that Range did not begin drilling in Nora until 2005; therefore Nora had zero impact on the first year of the referenced Bank of America study. The second reason is that until Range equalized its interest in Nora with EQT in the spring of 2007, we had a significantly lower interest in Nora. So although Nora results are included in 2005, 6, and 7, it was at a much lower interest. The first full year of impact of Nora was in 2008.", "The third reason that Nora will be more impactful going forward is due horizontal drilling technology. We expect the drilling to tight gas and shale's horizontally will result in improved economics.", "Keeping with the theme of improved capital efficiency from Range, not only will each of our top three projects get significantly better with time, they are now becoming the dominant portion of our capital spending. For the five year period from 2004 to 2008, we spend significant capital in Furman, Conger, Clayton and Madonna type gas sands, and the Gulf Coast, etc.", "This year in 2009, 90% of our capital is going into the Marcellus, Nora or the Barnett shell. These three plays have a significantly higher rates of return, significantly lower F&B and LOE, have better rate growth than any of other projects listings and also have significantly higher reserve upside.", "So as good as Range has been in the past, we should be even better in the future. The F&B costs for these three properties ranges from about $1.00 to $1.50 and the LOE from all three properties are low. It's also important that two of our top three projects are in the Appalachian basin where the gas price is better than anywhere else in the U.S.", "Range has consistently delivered top tier organic production and reserve growth with one of the lowest cost structures in the business. This is a direct result of our simple strategy of strong organic growth to top core cost structure or better and in addition, consistently building and hydrating our inventory coupled with one of the best teams in the industry.", "Range today has more upside and lower risk upside than at any time in the company's history. With our inventory, we have the opportunity to grow the company more than ten fold primarily from the Marcellus shale and lower end of Barnett shale.", "We believe our excellent organic growth combined with an excellent cost structure will result in continuing to create strong shareholder returns over time.", "Back to you John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks Jeff. That was a terrific update. Now let's look ahead a bit.", "Looking to the second half of 2009, we see continued strong operating results. For the third quarter we're looking for production to average 430 to 435 million a day, representing an 11% increase year over year. ", "The third quarter will reflect the full impact of the sale of our Furman field which we closed on the last day of the second quarter. Furman produced approximately 15 million a day net, so due to the timing of the Furman sale, third quarter production will most likely come in slightly less than the second quarter.", "If so, we will break our quarterly production increase streak. However, selling Furman was clearly the right thing to do, especially given the fact that we got a very good price for it. All that being said, with the momentum from the excellent drilling results that we've had so far this  year, we currently believe we'll achieve double digit production growth again this year, even after taking into account the asset sale and a much lower capital budget.", "Given our reduced capital program, we are focusing over 90% of our CapEx Jeff mentioned in the Marcellus, Nora and the Barnett plays. These three plays generate attractive rates of return even at low gas prices. ", "We are fortunate that the remaining properties in our portfolio have only shallow decline curve. In particular, our gas and CBM properties in Appalachia are in decline at less than 10%.", "One of the key elements that had a very positive impact on our results this year relates to the capital efficiency. In the past, we've spent considerable capital on the Marcellus without seeing much return and as Jeff mentioned, in October of last year this all changed as the first phase of infrastructure was completed and production began to ramp up.", "As the Marcellus production continues to ramp us in 2009, we will see the capital efficiency impact have an ever increasing impact on Range. This is allowing us to do more with less. In the second quarter our CapEx totaled $165 million, including $16 million of Marcellus acreage we acquired in exchange for Range common stock.", "So, our cash CapEx was $149 million in the second quarter which was fully funded by $166 million of operating cash flow. So for the full year 2009, our cash flow and completed asset sales will be more than adequate to fund our capital program.", "Lastly, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the Marcellus shell play. In our operations news release that we put out a few weeks ago, and as Jeff talked about, we announced our estimate of the average gross ultimate reserves of our 24 horizontal Marcellus wells that have been on production for 120 days or longer.", "On average these wells have been on production for 313 days, almost one year. Our estimate indicates gross ultimate reserves for these 24 wells will average 4.4 bcfe. Given how early in the play, we still believe that three to four bcf per well is a reasonable estimate when one thinks about Range's entire acreage position. More than ever, we strongly believe that where is your acreage is located is extremely important. ", "We have also provided an updated well cost number of $3.5 million for pad drilling in southwest Pennsylvania. We also posted on our website a slide that shows not only the decline curve projection for the 24 wells, but also our rate of return estimate.", "The reason we did this is to provide a picture of what really matters which is the rate of return we're generating in the Marcellus. Using a $6.00 NYMEX gas price held flat forever, adjusting for base differentials, Marcellus drilling projects 64% rate of return and Jeff also gave the number at $5.00 and $7.00.", "This compares to 52% for the Fayetteville core, 39% for the Barnett core and 36% for the Haynesville core. While the numbers will certainly change as each of these shell plays drill out, this is our best estimate given the public data that is currently available and looking at other company's presentations.", "What's interesting to note is that the initial IP rate does not automatically translate into highest rate of return. Other factors such as well cost, royalty burden, gas quality, transportation cost and basic differential also play a very important role in determining rate of return for each of the shell plays.", "While we were in the R&D phase of the Marcellus shell play, we provided IP rates for both our vertical and horizontal wells. The IP rates were important as they gave us a rough understanding of the productivity of the wells. More important in IP's however, is longer term production history from which we can estimate gross ultimate reserves and projected rates of return.", "The good news is that based on our first 24 wells in the Marcellus, we have a play that generates very attractive rates of return. The question is how consistent and repeatable will the Marcellus be over those very large acreage position.", "To date we've drilled over 100 vertical and horizontal wells in the Marcellus which is derisk and a material portion of our acreage. As we continue to ramp up drilling and gain additional information, we will hopefully derisk more and more of our large acreage position. Said in a simple way, we know that the Marcellus works in an attractive way in certain area. The question is, how much of the acreage will drill out.", "As we move forward with the development of the Marcellus play, we're providing more and more information as to reserve quantities, well cost, etc. and less and less IP information. This is the same MO that we used in the Barnett shell project. ", "As we all know, well IP data can be calculated in many different ways. It's difficult to compare IP rates calculated by one company to initial production rates calculated by a different company. We believe by providing estimated reserve quantities, decline curves, well cost etc., investors will be able to make a more informed decision as to the quality and the potential of our Marcellus acreage. From time to time we'll continue to provide IP rates for certain wells as we deem newsworthy.", "On our website we've posted a slide that compares the Marcellus to the other major shell plays. I want to make it clear that we're not trying to predict the outcome for each of these shell plays. There will be wells drilled by other companies in the other shell plays that will be better or worse than our analysis.", "This is our attempt to broadly compare the plays based on information we have at hand today. In each of the shell plays, where a company's acreage is located is critically important. The core of each of these plays will be far less than the gross play outline. I strongly caution investors, do not attempt to hand over a large acreage position of the various companies and assume they are going to be the same.", "The definitive way to know how good an acreage block is is to drill the well and see what the production and see what they look like. All in all, we believe this information will be helpful and will assist in distinguishing Range from other companies. Most importantly, it should give our shareholders a much better feel for the potential we have in the Marcellus play.", "It's been roughly five years since we drilled our first Marcellus vertical well, the Range number one, and we've come a long, long way since then. I want to give most of the credit to our Marcellus team in Pittsburg as they're the ones that are making the Marcellus real.", "In summary, looking at Range today, we have our largest and highest quality drilling inventory in our history. Our inventory together with our emerging plays; represent 20 to 28 pcf of future growth potential. This equates to seven to ten times our existing crude reserves.", "We're excited about the growth potential of Range. We're intently focused on delivering each quarter. The second quarter of 2009 is a shining example of the commitment by all the employees at Range.", "With that, let's turn the call over for some questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Thomas Gardner \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "Thomas Gardner \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "I have a few questions related to the Marcellus specifically on those 24 wells that went into your tight curve. How many of those were below your 4.4 bcf well average and if you remove the problem wells, what impact would that have on your average EUR?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Out of our whole data set, the only wells we really removed from that were the first three wells which were our first three attempts and our fourth well was our great success back in August of 2007, and give the team again great credit for figuring out the plays so quickly, particularly when you compare that against the Barnett or any of the other shell plays.", "The results are reasonably consistent across there. Granted there is some spread but there's a lot of consistency as well. But I couldn't be more excited. I thought three or four B's was great and I'd still be thrilled with that, but the fact that these wells are 4.4 B's and get economics that are that strong, I couldn't be happier with.", "Thomas Gardner \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "I really do appreciate your shale play comparison. I just wanted to ask you to kind of fill out the terminal decline rates and perhaps the life of each of those. I'm sure I could back into them but I just wanted to know what you were assuming.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "The decline rates we used for each of them was 6% and life of 40 years. And again, the key is ultimately on all these plays, what kind of rate of return does that generate? The shape of the curve, the gas price you get, the royalty, the cap you pay and then of course rate of return takes into account the discounting of that and again, I think for any large scale repeatable play in the U.S., that's about as good as it gets that I'm aware of.", "And we tried to be very fair with all the plays. Like John said, we just use the public data Rodney mentioned on the other three plays, but we tried to bias the other plays to the high side by taking the core, best operators and compared it against that.", "Thomas Gardner \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "And your thoughts on development plans for your northeast portion of the Marcellus and your thoughts on the quality of that acreage relative to what you're developing now.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "I'm excited about that. Like we mentioned earlier, the best Range has the best horizontal well which is in the southwest actually peaked out at 36 million per day on average, over 10 million per day for 30 days. Out best vertical well was actually up in the northeast and we announced that. I don't remember the exact rate, but it was over 6 million a day and it was working very strong.", "We're just beginning horizontal drilling up there. Our first rig should be on location middle of August, by the end of August. We'll drill two back to back, and actually we're excited about both of the wells because we're offsetting the best vertical well and also another excellent vertical well. ", "We've already shot three 3-D over those areas so we're offsetting great vertical off of existing 3-D's in areas where we've got nice blocky positions and a lot of running room. Time will tell, but we should have those results well before the end of the year.", "Thomas Gardner \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "Any thoughts on your acreage in Robertson County with respect to the Granite Wash?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "We have the Granite Wash play up in the Texas Panhandle primarily that we're pursuing. Those are good wells. There was big news this morning with the horizontal wells by Newfield. The stuff we're doing in the mid continent is great. Given the size of the acreage positions we have and repeatability, they're strong economics, strong rates of return, but we don't have 900,000 acres like we have in the Marcellus with that large scale and repeatability. ", "But the economics of our plays up there in the Granite Wash in St. Louis are strong.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ronald Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice & Co.", "Ronald Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice & Co.", "Just one question on your northeast PA development, any additional information on where that well was drilled? ", "Jeffrey Ventura", "I think we said that earlier. We're going to start drilling in Lycoming County.", "John Pinkerton", "We have nice acreage position from Bradford down into Lycoming and into some of the other counties there. We haven't specifically put it all out, but 350,000 acres is a big position. And again, we're offsetting some excellent, the best vertical wells that I'm aware of in the entire play which is our well.", "Ronald Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice & Co.", "As you approach looking ahead to 2010 and have a six rig program, would you still have a predominant amount of your activity in southwest Pennsylvania and would you start concentrating a lot of that activity within that 65% or so of your acreage which ahs been bounded by industry activity or how you progress in terms of testing the remaining 150,000 to 175,000 acres in southwest PA that isn't within that industry box that you described?", "John Pinkerton", "We'll be doing three things next year. One will be continuing, really we know its about driving up production at low cost and driving up production per share and capital per share and we're going to do that predominantly in the southwest in the low derisk area.", "In addition, by the end of next year, by the end of 2010, we should have take away capacity up in the northeast, so we'll also begin drilling in the northeast. But we'll be doing development drilling up there. A lot of the drilling is going to be down in the southwest. And then if you go to 2011, you'll see a significant ramp up in the northeast as well. ", "In addition, the third thing that we'll be doing is continuing to delineate the rest of the acreage so that we understand what we have and where it is. And if that's in the Marcellus, and like I mentioned earlier, this year we'll actually drill two wells by the end of the this year, one for the Utica shale and one for the upper shale's.", "John Pinkerton", "I think one thing that's also important, when you get a big acreage like that; you've got to obviously be cognizant of expiring leases and terms on your leases and what not. The news is, we've got a lot of acreage is held by production so there is no term on it so that's really good news.", "The next big chunk of our acreage is acreage that has three to ten years left on the term. So we don't have that much acreage in the short term that's going to expire on wells to the 900,000 acres. So I think we only have commitment wells, two or three commitments, maybe a handful of commitment wells that we have to drill over the next 12 months.", "So that's really going to afford us a lot of flexibility to really put the rigs in places that we know are going to drive up production or in areas that we've got big acreage lots that are still relatively untouched that we can go see what's going on and try to get some technical data on those.", "We're not being driven by the land so much. It's just where the opportunities are and what can really drive up our rate of return and our stock price quite frankly.", "Ronald Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice & Co.", "When you look at your expected activity levels, I'm assuming part of that is dependent on your cash flows, therefore the pricing. To maintain a six rig program through next year is that $554 million that you're putting in a pretty good number that you need to fund that kind of program?", "John Pinkerton", "You've got it. It's pretty simple. We'll spend our cash flow and the 550 by 750 just made sense in terms of not only in the way we view the market but also what it takes for us to be able to double the production from the end of this year to the end of next year. So we feel really good about that as well.", "Obviously just like last year, just like this year and last year, Ted and his team will be looking at assets and divestitures and what not and I think we've still got a few little ones that we're working on this year and then we've got some other ones that we're thinking about for next year and that will just add to that. ", "So we feel really good about our ability to fund the CapEx program this and next year given our cash flow and the asset sales that we see down the road. So we feel really good about. And the other things is, and again, don't want to beat a dead horse here, but the capital, I can't be more excited about the impact of the capital efficiency.", "It sounds trite to say it, but we're just doing more with less, and the reason is, we're focused on the things that have the least finding cost so what it does is allows you to do more. That coupled with the fact that the Marcellus is now going from a little turbo boost to reverse the drag, and plus the fact that you're seeing, we're starting to see some of the full benefits of lower service costs as well.", "So when you take all that into consideration, our capital efficiency is really, that to me is the most exciting thing about Range right now, is just the capital efficiency and how that drives through your capital budget and everything else you do and how you look at that and look at the company in terms of value per share and things like that so that's kind of how we look at it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "Is the 24.5 million a day well in the tight curve? Has that been on for more than 120 days?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes. That well in there as is probably the worst well in there. It's all in there. It doesn't significantly drive it as one well out of 24.", "The other thing I'd like to say too, and just to clarify that a little bit, I may be partly guilty of driving that. Being my engineering background and the other engineers we have, engineers are nerdy guys. One of the fun things to do is when we had that new plant come on last October, we knew we had an excellent well and what we did was just let that well flow full bore into the plant.", "We aren't designing our wells going forward to achieve maximum rates. We're looking at maximum rates of return and maximum PBI and MPV. So a lot of the wells in that curve, you could argue are actually restricted early, but I think you're talking about this changing the shape of the curve a little bit.", "At the end of the day, if we can generate 64% rates of return at $6.00 gas and under $1.00 finding cost, I'll do that all day long, particularly when we've got thousands of wells to do it on. So a lot of people get skewed by that. I have to admit I somewhat regret a little bit when we did that because somebody asks a question and I'll just answer it. ", "When you haven't talked about other wells or high rate wells, what does that mean? It just means that we have an engineered and designed them that way. We drilled excellent wells. We've drilled wells that recently have tested a 10 million and over per day and could have even done more. So you've got to remember for the guys that are engineers that are on this call, you can make those wells to some degree as long as you have capacity, whether you produce a well 24 million a day, 15, 10 or five, what you're doing is changing the shape of the curve, not the reserves.", "And granted it affect rate of return, but at the end of the day it's about optimizing rate of return, MPV and as long as we can make smart decisions like that, that's what we'll do. That was a fun engineering experiment.", "John Pinkerton", "I'm not an engineer. I'll put my take on it. If you look at what we're doing now, now that we've got the infrastructure built out and we've got compression throughout 2,000 acres that Jeff talked about, in some cases we don't have the ability to flow these wells at 100% of their capacity when they come on line just because we're not designing the take away capacity or the compression to do that.", "If you did, you'd be wasting money. So we don't think our shareholders want us to waste money. We think we want to maximize the MPV. So that was a little bit about my whole discussion about IP rates. And I know they're important, especially for you all out there that when you see these different plays, the only way to some degree you can tell the different is look at some of the IP's.", "But I'd be really careful when you think about IP rates because they're just one little piece of the puzzle and there's a lot more to be looked at when you're looking at that. And again, IP rates can vary all over the board by how long it was, what kind of shelf, what kind of back pressure you've got on it. There's a gazillion different things that really impact that.", "That is the primary reason that we spent the last four or five weeks and Al and his team to come with this curve and do all this other stuff, is to really give our shareholders who I care 100% about, a much better feel of what we've got here. And I think the only way of doing it was to get away from the IP rates and really focus on the decline curve and what we think on a preliminary to what the ultimate reserves are and how that translates into a rate of return.", "We'll continue to update that slide. We'll continue to give you information as those things change. One of the things we're looking at is longer lateral links, doing more stages. Just like in the other plays we're doing that. We've had good success on that as well. And that could actually increase our well costs but in some cases would actually increase our net present value and reduce our finding costs.", "So there's a lot of things. We're still tinkering with the valve to get this right and again, over such a large acreage position, one thing we learned in the Barnett, you can go five to ten miles away and you'd have to adjust the valves a little bit. So again, one of the reasons why we don't have 10 or 15 rigs running right now, we're taking it \"a little bit easy\" from some people's perspective, because we want to make sure we do it right.", "And our view of it is, quality not quantity and we did that in the Barnett and we're going to do the same thing in the Marcellus.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "In your IRR's, what's your assumption on cash operating expenses, LOE and gathering transportation?", "Roger Manny", "For the Marcellus when you look at those two numbers combined it's a little under $1.00 and then we just used public data for the other three. If you want the exact details, call Parkerson later on. I think you know him. He'll key you in better. The rest is just public data.", "That's just our best guess at taking public data. Feel free to use whatever public data out there but our Marcellus data, we're confident. We just tried to take the best most optimistic reasonable data for those other three plays.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Looking at the acreage cost, in the $14 million to $19 million that you mentioned, it seems like a high percentage of what you spend historically for acreage and I was wondering if that number is going to be coming down in the next few quarters or am I missing something in the way I'm looking at it?", "Roger Manny", "That $19 million, high end of the estimate includes just the regular quarterly amortization of your unproved and also an assessment for your larger blocks that you look at on an individual basis. And you're right. It will change. It will vary over time with our experience, how many wells we drill and all these other factors I went through on last quarter's call.", "I think that's a good estimate on where we're going to be right now going forward. The other add on as I mentioned was Barnett acreage, a couple of big blocks that didn't make sense for us.", "Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "What goes into that number of what you're writing off, especially the pure acreage cost, right? There's not other capital going into that number?", "Roger Manny", "That's right. It's the amount we book for acreage. And back to one of the parts in your original questions, if you take that $19 million amount and divide it into our total unproved property balance, you're going to see that that amount tracks very closely what we've seen from Cabot, EOG in prior quarters.", "Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "There's a lot of discussion lately about increased regulation over the counter derivatives market. Do you have any thoughts on how that might affect your hedging strategy going forward?", "John Pinkerton", "One, what I've seen is the legislation seems to be idiotic to put it plainly. But as I understand it there's a lot of discussion there and a lot of exchanging as we speak. I think at the end of the day, somebody with intelligence will actually look at it and come with something that makes a lot of sense. I don't think what they wrote they intended and intelligence and reasonableness takes over and what gets passed from that, but who knows?", "Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Your current structure, are you required to make any margin, cash margin payments or do use the reserves as collateral for hedges?", "John Pinkerton", "We do exactly that. Our hedge portfolio is very diversified essentially among our bank group. We've got 26 banks in our bank group and we've got a number of those are in the credit, are some of the big institutions that do a lot on the hedging side. We do have some basic hedges with Goldman and a couple of other people that aren't in our credit facility, but they're relatively minor.", "Over 95% of hedging book, there's no margin, because it's secured under our credit facility. And that goes both ways as well. The good news is those institutions can't pay us when we don't pay them on the interest, so it goes both ways which I think is really important given what we've seen over the last 12 months.", "Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "On the Marcellus, is there any production currently coming from the dry gas window up there or is it all being processed?", "", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Pretty much everything we have down in the southwest at this point is being processed. There's a few exceptions to that. And we are not online in the northeast yet. That will be at the end of 2010. We've drilled some great wells and tested them for 30 days, but we're just starting horizontal drilling and that will be online at the end of next year.", "John Pinkerton", "We've got several infrastructure projects that we've actually got going up there in terms of the dry gas side that I'm very pleased with in terms of the progress. We've got a great marketing team up there, so they're doing a great job and they're right on schedule doing everything we've asked them to do. And very experienced, these guys and gals, they've got a lot of experience in the base and they know all the other big pipeline companies and we've got a lot of really neat infrastructure things we're working on.", "So that actually much better, much more ahead of schedule than I would have ever though a year or two ago, so very pleased on that front.", "Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Is that also being done by Marquest?", "John Pinkerton", "All the stuff in the southwest is. There's some other stuff that's not. But that's kind of the way we intended it all along, quite frankly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Hall \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.", "Michael Hall \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Keeping on the capital efficiency theme I'm wondering if you have any totals as to what you spent to date in the Marcellus and when do you think you'll start to turn free cash flow positive? Is it a year out, two years out, five years out, any color there?", "Roger Manny", "I can answer that in a very general way. We've spent roughly $1 billion in the Marcellus and we've run a lot of models taking the project through depletion in all the different areas, sensitizing greater drilling and all kinds of different things. It's surprising. It turns free cash positive a lot quicker than you think when you start running that tight curve and model that we put out there.", "But I don't want to get any more specific than that at this point. But again, our goal is to be good stewards of our shareholders money. We've got a great project with strong rates of return at low cost that's very repeatable, so I think we've got great places to invest our money in the Marcellus as well as the Nora.", "Michael Hall \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Thinking about the southwest Pennsylvania region in general, you seem to have a lot of production of your own ramping up and a lot of other operators, a lot of gas coming in to the region. Any thoughts of locking in differentials there? Have you taken any steps along those lines?", "John Pinkerton", "We have. What's interesting is that there's been a lot of talk about a lot of rates, but probably at the end of this year, the Marcellus probably is I would guess, 200 million to 250 million a day in total. So it's going to take a number of years to really make the play in general what I call material for the industry.", "That being said, by the end and clearly by the end of next year, it's going to be very material to us, and that's quite frankly what I care about. But I think it's going to take longer. It's going to take the Haynesville longer. It's going to take the Marcellus in general just to get all this stuff sorted out.", "On the margin, could it affect your basic differentials, yes, plus or negative $0.10. It probably could, but again the way I look at it, that's fairly immaterial. But again, back to what we're doing, we're taking a very aggressive proactive stance in terms of the market and the gas and looking at things and we're looking at a lot of end user projects.", "There's an enormous amount of interest in the Marcellus and that gas in terms of long term electric generation and a whole lot of other things. A lot of people come to us. We're looking at a lot of different opportunities. It's really exciting. But we'll let our team up there do that.", "They're really exciting, but some of them are years away, but very exciting in terms of some of the things we're seeing out there in terms of opportunities to sell gas to some very nice customers that actually pay their bills.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Unidentified Analyst", "Unidentified Analyst", "On the 4.4 bcf you are expecting over 40 years, given that a lot of the wells you have are from the wet gas area, are you up ticking the volumes or running the price up with respect to the liquid extraction?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "We're just running with the current efficiency off the cryo plants in terms of the liquid extraction.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So basically your pricing that you're modeling in would reflect the liquid extraction that you get from it.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes.", "Unidentified Analyst", "On that 40 mile by 40 mile area that you're talking about in southwest PA, I'm guessing that's including Washington, how many wells of the 24 wells that you have production data for have come from more the southern PA acreage and from those wells, are they below or meeting the tight curve or slightly above?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "They're all from southwest PA and they're all inside that box. That tight curve is the summation of all those wells. There's a distribution like typically you'd see but they're all reasonably consistent with there.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So specifically in northern Washington, can you disclose how much acreage you have in northern Washington out of that box?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "No. What you've seen us do over time is continue to peel back more and more layers of the onion, give you more and more detail. We've done that again this time by coming out literally with the actual tight curve of those wells in our current cost and we'll continue to get more and more data, but it's also competitive so we're always in that position of again, we want to be good steward of our shareholder money. We're all large shareholders. It's the bulk of our net worth so the IR guys would always like to give more information because you guys always want more. ", "The technical guys always want to give none because they know it's competitive. But we'll continue to give more and more data as we go forward. Hopefully you guys have been pleased with this latest round of data. That actually is our zero time slot, or \"our tight curve\" for those wells and like John said, we'll continue to update those.", "Unidentified Analyst", "The acre spacing, you just mentioned that 80 acre spacing, does it make it sense from the gas in place numbers and the 4.4 on 80 or do you think laying out 40's or 50's are possible?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "You're right. We're looking at a combination of decline curves and tying it back to volume metrics. We're thinking about what's reasonable. We've done more simulation and modeling. I think that's a very reasonable number at this point in time. As we learn more about the Marcellus and more about the formations that's right on top of it as well as some of the things below it, we'll continue to update you on our thoughts on spacing.", "But hopefully what you saw is the, 4.4 B's is what we think is a very real number. That's literally the average of those wells today.  We're drilling for 3.5 million and generating those kinds of rates of return that are shown on the plotting, and again I think if you compare that to any large scale repeatable project out there, I think that's as good as it gets and I think our team's done a great job getting there as quickly as they have.", "But we're always going to work on optimizing. Like John said, we're never going to be happy. We always want to drill higher and higher quality wells and improve our MPV and rates of return and we'll continue to experiment and hopefully the guys will improve on that, although if they never improve on that and we can just continue to repeat it, I'll be a very happy guy.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Are you running other rigs as well to start the hole off?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "We drill the straight part of the hole with the smaller rig and then come back and drill the horizontal part with a bigger rig.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "So you have three horizontal rigs running.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "That's an important point just for clarification. When we say three rigs, I'm just counting the big rigs. There's actually three small rigs ahead of those so if you want to count all of them, we're counting six rigs and six would become 12, so double the big rigs. Don't double the big rigs.", "Unidentified Analyst", "In Lycoming, did you take cores on the first few verticals?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "We have a lot of data. We've got full log suites and EKES logs. We might have some core data. Off the top of my head I don't remember. I know we have 3-D over the areas we're going to be drilling. That's why I feel really good about those wells. Until you drill them and complete them your never know. Great vertical wells, those are the best vertical wells we've ever drilled off an existing 3-D so that's about as derisk as you can get.", "It will be interesting to see how it does and time will tell. We'll know in short order. We've got a big position up there, 350,000 acres so to the extent we have success, perhaps those reserve number there can be even higher.", "Unidentified Analysts", "And you've already organized the pipeline right of ways and stuff like that?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "We've bought that. We have our taps. Like John said, the guys are staying ahead. I feel comfortable getting on by the end of next year. So we'll have big volumes eventually coming from both the northeast and the southwest.", "Operator", "This concludes today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Pinkerton for his concluding remarks.", "John Pinkerton", "Thank you all for joining us again. Clearly an interesting environment we are in in terms of this industry. I've always said that the cure for low gas prices is low gas prices, and I think today's historic number just reflects the fact that we've dropped over 60% of natural gas rigs in the U.S. It's staring to having an impact.", "We're walking through the desert here. Nobody like to do it, but we'll get back to some positive GDP here eventually and the supply side comes down I think gas prices will normalize. That being said, I've always said, it's my advice you ought to buy rings irrespective of what you think gas prices are.", "We're not the best predictor of gas prices. We don't thing that's our job, and quite frankly we don't think we're very good at it. What we're good at is driving up production land reserves at low cost year in and year out. We think that's what really drives rates of return and our stock price over a period of time.", "I know we've given out a lot of information in terms of the Marcellus and I'm sure there's lots of people have lots of questions about all the little details of that. Feel free to call us afterward and we'll get you that data to the extent that data is available, and we'll get you that information.", "There's a cut off in terms of competitiveness where we won't give it to you, but some of the things we talked about, we'll give you some of the details if we've got it. Feel free. We've had a number of you come by the office of late. Feel free to come by and we'll update you on what we're doing.", "We're extremely excited about what we've done so far this year. We think we're in a very good position to be able to drive up value even at these low gas prices, and in some respect I think that low prices has actually been good for us in the Marcellus because it's kind of slowed things down a little bit in terms of acreage, competitiveness and it's let us really block up some of the acreage that we probably wouldn't have been able to do otherwise.", "So at the end of the day, we're very well positioned and we look forward to giving you in the third quarter our results and progress to date.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney Waller", "", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome. Rang reported results for the first quarter in 2008 posting continued record production revenues, cash flow and analyst adjusted earnings. With the first quarter of 2008, we begin our sixth consecutive year of posting sequential production growth with our 21st consecutive quarter. We have posted on our Website supplemental tables to assist you in understanding many of the numbers in the press release. ", "In the press release, we have furnished non-GAAP statements which will allow you to compare our results to our historically reported numbers which include the Gulf of Mexico operations that we sold during 2007.

First, we did file our 10-Q with the SEC this morning. It's now available on the home page of our website or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we've posted on our website supplemental tables which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins, and the reconciliation of our non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today. Tables are also posted on the Web site that will give you detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter.", "Second, we will be participating in several conferences in May. Check our Website for a complete listing. We will be at the Calyon Energy Conference in New York on May the 14th and Deutsche Bank Energy & Utility Conference in Miami on May the 28. Now let me turn the call over to John.", "John Pinkerton", "", "Thanks, Rodney. Before Roger reviews our first quarter financials results, I will review the key accomplishments so far in 2008. On a year-over-year basis, first quarter production rose 21% meeting the high end of our guidance by $15 million today. This also marks the 21st consecutive quarter of sequential correction growth. The driver for the higher than anticipated production was exceptional performance by each and every one of our divisions. It was one of those rare quarters where nearly everything went right and essentially nothing went wrong. I must say, I haven't experienced many of these types of quarters in my career but hopefully we will have some more. ", "Our drilling program was on the schedule throughout the quarter as we drilled 189 wells. We continued to be extremely pleased with the redrilling results and we are generating some very attractive returns. We currently have 33 rigs running. The 21% increase in production coupled with a 15% increase in realized prices drove record cash flow of $241 million. This is a whopping $79 million or 49% higher than the first quarter of last year and compared to the fourth quarter of '07 cash flow was up $51 million or 27%. ", "We are most pleased on the cost side of our business. As our controllable cost were well in line with expectations and our margins increased sharply. Our cash operating margin for the quarter reached an all-time high of $7.15 per Mcfe, up 23% year over year and 20% higher than fourth quarter '07. By posting record production volumes keeping our cost in check and the benefit of strong prices, as you can see we've set the stage for another terrific and record year for Range and its shareholders.", " ", "Besides the operational progress, we completed three transactions already in 2008, which the results (inaudible) we make it for a better, more valuable Range. We completed two property acquisitions for $311 million. In both acquisitions, we bought additional interest in the Barnett Shale play where we've been very successful and where we see substantial upside. Conversely we completed one property sale in the quarter for $64 million. The sale included some shallow, higher cost oil properties in East Texas, where we did not own the deep rights.", "With regard to emerging plays, significant headway was made as we continued to drill some fantastic wells, expand our acreage positions and build infrastructure. And in addition, we continue to add high quality technical personnel to our teams working these plays, which gives us a significant advantage. All in all, I couldn't be more pleased on how much we have accomplished so far in the year. It's a real testimony to the entire Range team. With that, I will turn the call over to Roger to review our financial results.", "Roger Manny", "", "Thank you, John. The first quarter of each year is historically a very strong quarter for Range, and as John just mentioned, the first quarter of 2008 represents an exceptionally robust showing for the company. The first quarter of 2008 has again brought forth record quarterly oil and gas sales, including cash settled derivates, up to $322 million. Record quarterly EBITDAX of $265 million, record quarterly cash flow of $241 million, and record cash margins of $7.15 an Mcfe. John mentioned Range continued to high grade its asset base and drilling inventory during the first quarter, with the sale of our higher cost non-strategic shallow oil properties in East Texas for $64 million, and the acquisition of higher quality low cost Barnett Shale properties for $311 million.", "Looking at the first quarter, the big performance drivers were 21% increase in production and a 15% increase in realized oil and gas prices. These increases drove the 41% increase in oil and gas revenues from $228 million last year to $322 million figure this year. Cash flow for the quarter was 49% higher than the first quarter of 2007. And cash flow per share for the quarter came in at $1.57. That's 13% higher than the analyst consensus estimate of $1.39. Quarterly EBITDAX is $265 million, was 46% higher than the first quarter of '07. First quarter cash margins improved by 23% over last year from 5.8 per Mcfe in '07 to the $7.15 per Mcfe figure in '08.", "Sequentially, first quarter cash margins were 20% higher than the fourth quarter of '07 figure of $5.98 an Mcfe. Cash margins were boosted by favorable hedging results, higher liquids prices and better basis differentials. Book net income was impacted by three material adjustments: First, a non-cash $135 million pre-tax mark-to-market downward adjustment of our unrealized oil and gas hedges. This was due to higher prices at the end of the quarter. Second, a non-cash $27 million pre-tax mark-to-market expense attributable to the Range stock and marketable securities held on our employee deferred comp plan and other stock-based compensation. Third, a $21 million pre-tax gain on the January sale of our East Texas oil properties.", "Now, first quarter earnings also include a $3.8 million non-cash deferred tax expense which represents valuation allowance taken to one of our deferred tax assets and a reduction in state tax credit carry-forward. Now, our projected tax rate for the year still remains 38%. These two entries are discrete items and they will not impact our statutory rate going forward. Quarterly earnings calculated using analyst consensus methods were $95 million or $0.62 per fully diluted share. This compares to the analyst consensus estimate of $0.54.", "As Rodney mentioned, listeners are always encouraged to visit the Range Resources web site for a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, including cash flow, EBITDAX and cash margins. Looking at the expense categories for the first quarter of '08, which for comparison purposes include the Gulf of Mexico results in the first quarter of '07, the big story is a positive impact our higher production had upon many of our unit cost measures. Cash direct operating cost for the first quarter was $0.96 an Mcfe compared to $0.99 in the first quarter of last year. For comparison, cash direct operating cost in the first quarter of last year without the Gulf of Mexico properties was $0.95 and that's essentially flat with the current quarter.", "Production and ad valorem taxes came in at $0.41 for the first quarter of '08 compared to $0.38 an Mcfe last year. Our prior quarter direct cash operating cost guidance, which was mid to high $0.90 range, remains appropriate for 2008. General and administrative expense adjusted for non-cash stock compensation items was $0.38 an Mcfe for the first quarter. Now that's down 5% from the $0.40 figure in the first quarter of '07. G&A expense will increase on an absolute basis this year going forward, as we progressively staff up our emerging play teams. So we expect to continue G&A to average in the $0.42 to $0.43 per Mcfe range for the rest of '08.", "Interest expense for the first quarter of '08 was $0.69 an Mcfe. That's $0.02 less than the first quarter of last year and $0.02 higher than the full year of '07. Higher debt levels and higher interest expense, partially stemming from our October '07 refinancing of $250 million short-term bank debt to long-term debt, will contribute to keep interest costs higher in '08 than '07. So, investors can expect interest expense per Mcfe to average in the low to mid $0.70 range for all of '08. ", "Looking at exploration expense for the first quarter, excluding non-cash comp, this figure was $15.5 million, $4.5 million higher than the first quarter of last year, mostly due to higher seismic expenses. We anticipate that quarterly expiration expense including non-cash comp will approximate $18 million to $20 million per quarter the rest of year. Of course, that depends on our drilling success and the timing of our seismic purchases. Some the seismic dollars not spent in the first quarter this year will probably be spent in the second quarter, which may push exploration expense into the $20 million to $22 million range next quarter.", "Depletion, depreciation and amortization per Mcfe for the first quarter $2.12. That's compared to $1.84 of the first quarter of last year. The break down on this $2.12 figure is $1.95 representing depletion expense, $0.13 attributable to depreciation, amortization of other assets. And $0.04 came from expiring leasehold acreage. Our continuing DD&A rate should stay in the $2.12 range going forward.", "Looking at the balance sheet for a moment, two items are worthy of special mention. One, debt increased by $289 million, mostly to fund the Barnett Shale acquisitions completed in the first quarter. And two, book equity declined by $84 million, primarily due to non-cash derivative mark-to-market adjustments. These two events resulted in an increase in our debt-to-cap ratio to 47% at the end of the first quarter. Listeners should know we remain committed to our target 40% debt-to-cap ratio and we do expect to work this ratio back down over time.", "To add to our liquidity position, we increased the committed portion of our bank credit facility from $900 million to $1 billion effective April 1 of this year. This will allow us over $400 million in committed credit availability at the end of the quarter. We also added two new banks to the credit facility, concurrently with the increase, such that no single bank in the credit facility holds more than 6% of the total commitment. And also, we had no interest rate increase or change in loan terms with these changes. We ended 2007 on a high note with record operating and financial results and the first quarter of '08 proved to be a continuation of the trend, with another record quarter of production, oil and gas revenue, EBITDAX, cash flow and margins. While the first quarter set a high bar for Range going forward, the first quarter also illustrates the full performance potential of the organization when all of the operating teams exceed their targets. John?", "John Pinkerton", "", "Thanks, Roger. Now, let's hear from Jeff Ventura about our exploration development activities. Jeff?", "Jeff Ventura", "", "Thanks, John. I'll begin by reviewing production. For the first quarter, production averaged 371 million per day, 21% increase over the first quarter of 2007 and an 8% increase over the fourth quarter of 2007. This represents the highest quarterly production rate in the company's history and the 21st consecutive quarter of sequential production growth.", "Let's now review three of our key projects. First, I'll start with the Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin. Currently, we have six rigs running in the Barnett and are continuing to drive up production. Net production at the end of the first quarter was approximately 95 million per day. In less than two years, we added approximately 70 million per day through the drill bit. The fact that we have been able to significantly increase our production by only running a few rigs speaks to both the quality of our acreage and our team. In total, we now have 108,000 net acres in the Barnett Shale. Our net unbooked potential in this acreage is more than 2.8 Tcf, which by itself could more than double the company's proved reserves.", "Currently, we have rigs drilling in Tarrant, Johnson, Parker and Hill Counties. Tarrant County continues to deliver strong results, with one of our most recent wells there coming online at a rate of 6.6 million per day. Our latest Parker County well was also very strong and tested at a rate of 5.4 million per day. We have also drilled, completed and fraced our second well in Ellis County. It's currently being flow tested and cleaning up.", "Another very impactful low risk project for us is our Nora area, located in Virginia in the Appalachian Basin. This is another project that has the potential to double Range's reserves by itself. There is significant upside to all three horizons in Nora: coalbed methane, tight gas sands and the Huron Shale. Range continues to drill successful CBM and tight gas sand wells in the field. 285 CBM wells and 50 tight gas sand wells are planned for this year.", "Finding and development costs net to Range continue to be around $1 per Mcf, which is among the lowest in the country. In addition, the wells produce very little water and have low lifting costs. Given its location in the Appalachian Basin, these wells receive a premium to NYMEX, so the combination of a great gas price, low F&D, and low LOE results in a good rate of return for the wells. Given the large number of wells to be drilled on current spacing and including successful down spacing, there are approximately 6,000 wells left to drill.", "The latest development in Nora is horizontal drilling in the Huron Shale. Our first well, which was completed in the fourth quarter, came online at an initial rate of 1.1 million per day. It cost about $1.2 million to drill and complete and although it's still very early, initial reserve estimates are about 1 Bcf. Given our working interest and net revenue interest, and remembering that Range owns the minerals, our net finding and development cost is about $1.07 per Mcf. This year, we'll be drilling 10 horizontal delineation wells across the 250,000 acre Nora block.", "We know that the Huron Shale has good thickness and gas content across the entire 250,000 acres because there are 90 existing vertical Huron Shale wells on the acreage. The purpose of the 10 horizontal delineation wells is to verify that the horizontal drilling works and is an effective way to economically develop these reserves. If the Huron Shale wells are successful, they will derisk about 1.5 Tcf of net gas to Range by year end. We recently began drilling our first horizontal Huron Shale well for 2008.", "Another high impact opportunity for Range is our Marcellus Shale play in the northern part of the Appalachian Basin. This project represents the opportunity to add 10 Tcf to 15 Tcf of net reserves to Range. The 10 Tcf to 15 Tcf is the net potential on Range's 650,000 net acres that we had previously disclosed in the play. The 650,000 acres is a high-graded estimate of our Marcellus acreage based on the current knowledge in the play. Range previously announced that it owns approximately 1.1 million acres total in the play. We are actively acquiring acreage and our high-graded acreage position now is approaching 700,000 acres.", "To date, we've drilled and completed 63 vertical and 15 horizontal Marcellus Shale wells and have an additional seven verticals and four horizontals waiting on completion. We just announced our last three horizontal completions which had initial production rates of 4.6, 2.6 and 5.8 million cubic feet per day. The last well was particularly exciting in that it topped our previous highest rate completion, which was 4.7 million per day and set a new high watermark for the company in this play.", "Range was the first company to apply modern drilling and completion techniques to the Marcellus Shale and kicked off the modern exploration and development of the play in 2004. We're currently way ahead of the pack in terms of total number of wells drilled. We were the first company to achieve rates in excess of 1 million per day on vertical wells and the first company to achieve success with horizontal drilling, with several wells now in the 3 to 5 million per day range.", "Our current focus is to begin development of our core areas, continue to delineate our acreage and aggressively add to our leasehold in select areas. We still see significant opportunities to grow our leasehold in multiple areas across the state and that we feel are highly prospective and we'll be aggressively pursuing the acreage. Given the success Range has had in this play, coupled with the success of others, competition for acreage has increased considerably over the last six months and the cost to acquire acreage has gone up significantly. We currently have three rigs running and will drill approximately 40 horizontal Marcellus Shale wells this year. Current plans are to pursue the play horizontally. 2008 will primarily be a year of delineation, acreage acquisition and building infrastructure. Significant volume growth will occur in 2009 and beyond.", "As I've mentioned many times before, Range is in five shale plays. Our strategy is to be leaders in the Appalachian Devonian Shale plays and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale play and followers in the other three plays, which are the Permian Basin Barnett play, Floyd Shale in the Black Warrior Basin and Woodford Shale in the Ardmore Basin.", "Let me quickly update you on the three plays in which we are followers. As I mentioned on the last call, Range does not have any drilling plans in the Floyd Shale. We'll be watching the activity of others. In the Permian Basin Barnett play, we're drilling our first well and it should be at TD shortly. It has multiple objectives, including the Fusselman, Barnett, Woodford and Atoka. Our Woodford Shale acreage is in the Ardmore Basin. Range recently completed our first two operated horizontal wells there. The second horizontal well tested at a peak rate of 2.8 million per day.", "We have many other high quality, exciting projects, which I'll be glad to talk about during the Q&A. But to summarize, Range is in a great position. We have a proved reserve base of 2.2 Tcf. On top of that, we've identified upside of between 16 Tcf to 22 Tcf, primarily in low risk, coalbed methane, shale gas and tight gas sand plays. We have a great track record of converting that to value for our shareholders. Range is where we want it to be, a low-cost producer with a lot of low-risk built-in growth. In summary, we're in a terrific position to continue to build shareholder value on into the future. Back to you, John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Jeff. Nice update there. Looking to the remainder of 2008, we see continued strong operating and financial results. For the second quarter of 2008, we are looking for production to increase 20% year-over-year. This is similar to the 21% year-over-year increase we achieved in the first quarter. With sharply higher production and strong oil and gas prices, we again anticipate second quarter revenues, cash flow and earnings will be substantially higher than the prior year period.", "Looking beyond the second quarter, we anticipate production to continue to increase in the third and fourth quarters as a result of our drilling program. Based on the solid first quarter results, we are well on our way to achieving solid double-digit production growth for yet another year. As you all recall, at the beginning of the year, we set our 2008 production growth target at 15%, including the impact of property sales. Given the excellent drilling results achieved so far in the year, we're rethinking our production growth target and will come out with a revised target after tomorrow's Board of Directors meeting.", "Due to the higher volumes in prices and the stable cost structure, full-year 2008 cash flow from operations is anticipated to increase by more than 30% over 2007. So, as you can see, 2008 shapes up to be a tremendous year for Range and its shareholders. While focused on getting our wells drilled and hitting our quarterly production targets, we also continue to expand our drilling inventory and make some exciting progress with some of our emerging plays. As you heard from Jeff, our technical teams have drilled some additional high rate wells, especially in regards to the Marcellus Shale play. Due to our success and that of some of the other operators in the play, the competition has risen dramatically and new players continue to enter the play.", "Given our success and the additional opportunities we've identified, we will be discussing our plan and strategy for this play with our Board of Directors at tomorrow's meeting. To pursue these opportunities, we will need to move quickly and aggressively, and we will likely need to allocate additional capital resources. Although our expanded technical teams gives us the ability to move aggressively, we will maintain disciplined approach in our financial regimens.", "In summary, looking at Range today, we have the largest drilling inventory in our history with over 11,000 projects in our inventory. Our inventory together with our emerging plays represents 16 Tcf to 22 Tcf of future growth potential. This equals 7 to 10 times our existing proved reserves. While we are extremely excited about the growth potential at Range, we are also intently focused on delivering each and every quarter. The first quarter of 2008 is a shining example of the commitment by all of the Range employees.", "With that, operator, why don't we open up the call for questions?", "Questions-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Pinkerton. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Mr. David Tameron with Wachovia. Please proceed with your question.", "John Pinkerton", "Good morning, David. Operator, why don't we go ahead to the next and David may be able to come back in. And questioners, let's try to limit our questions to one per questioner, since we have a lot of people on the call today that have queued up for questions.", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt", "I had a question, thinking about East Texas and your acreage that you have there, remember, you had some deep Bossier potential at one point. Can you give you any update as far as thoughts about drilling deep Bossier and capital there given some of the recent results that we've seen?", "Jeff Ventura", "Let me talk about that. We do have a position there that I think is a very high quality prospect. We really haven't talked about it at all publicly much. I can tell you we're currently in the process of starting a 3-D and we have a nice acreage position and we'll probably drill a well next year. So, it's a good quality prospect. When we talk about the 16 Tcf to 22 Tcf of upside, that's \u2013 maybe it's the point you are getting to, there's a lot \u2013 we have a high quality team that is continuing to generate good ideas. And we sort of talk about things and in just-in-time fashion. There's a lot of other good things that the teams will continue to generate and as we get closer to drilling them or after we drill them, we'll talk about those. But, it's a great prospect. I'm excited to see the 3-D and to ultimately drill the well.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt", "Just thinking about the next layers of the onion as you move forward. Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Tameron with Wachovia. Please proceed with your question.", "David Tamerson \u2013 Wachovia", "Okay, guys, hear me okay now?", "John Pinkerton", "Yes, David, thanks.", "David Tamerson \u2013 Wachovia", "Okay. Yes, congrats on a nice quarter.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks.", "David Tamerson \u2013 Wachovia", "A couple questions, John. A bigger picture, does the market change your plans for divestitures, what you have targeted, just given the fact where oil and gas prices are trading today?", "John Pinkerton", "David, that is a great question. We've completed one divestiture, as we stated in the first quarter. We've got some other things kind of teed up that we are looking at to sell. The one thing that we are starting to see out there, that in the case of some of the smaller transactions with some of the \u2013 that are typically bought by some the smaller producers and operators, we're seeing a less aggressive behavior. And I think that's directly related to the scale back in capital and the cost of capital to those particular companies. Now, we're still going to try to get some of those things done but that is at least \u2013 again, we are just starting the process. It's early in the year. But the good news is that, that being said, Chad and his team are doing a good job. There's a number of companies that have come to us with specific ideas to acquire specific things [ph]. So, we've got some pretty decent negotiations going on on several different fronts. So, I'm still \u2013 how should I say, optimistic that we'll continue to get the asset sales done. That being said, we obviously, to the extent that we've got numbers for each one of these projects and if we can sell it at a price that we think is attractive and makes sense for our shareholders, we will do it. If we don't, we won't. So, there's really not any pressure. So, we're kind of in one of those positions that if we get an offer that we like, we'll do it. If not, we'll just move on and go on down the road and either try to sell it later or tee up something else.", "David Tamerson \u2013 Wachovia", "All right, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Joel Allman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Joe Allman \u2013 JPMorgan", "Good afternoon, everybody. Could you give us some details on that Woodford Shale play that you referenced at the end with the second well that you've got drilled? Could you talk about cost per well and what you are expecting in terms of reserves and what your plans are?", "Jeff Ventura", "Let me give you a little bit of detail. Again, it's not one of the plays we're going to be leaders in and I want to draw the distinction. We're in the Ardmore Basin, not the Arkoma Basin. So, a different play from where Newfield and Devon have done a good job and are creating value. We are south of there. It's in the infancy of that play. It is the Woodford, it has some different characteristics. I mentioned it just because even though our acreage position and it's our IR materials and presentation, it's on the order of 16,000, 17,000 acres, it's not of the scale that the other plays. It still though could be several hundred Bcf net to us. I just thought it was encouraging that on our second try we ended up with a fairly reasonable well. We still, hopefully, will do better with that. And I think it's just too early to talk about cost and reserves. I think we're in the infancy, within the next \u2013 by the end of the year, I think we'll have a real good feel for what it is. Other players are starting to drill also. So, any time you're in a shale play, one of the things that's really exciting to me about the Marcellus, is we drilled 10 vertical wells and led the play. And then, really early on started drilling horizontals and in short order, started drilling some excellent wells. And the last 10 wells of 3 to 5 million a day, have actually averaged over 4 million per day, which is \u2013 I'm really excited about. It tells me we've got quality acreage with a quality team. And the difference in the Ardmore Basin, obviously, we don't have near the position and I don't think the play has near the potential but it still could add a lot of value to Range.", "Joe Allman \u2013 JPMorgan", "Great. Thanks for that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jack Aydin with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.", "Jack Aydin \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Hi, guys. Jeff, the three wells that you announced 4-6, 2-6, 5-8, could you give us indication what is the average cost and how long were the lateral of those wells?", "Jeff Ventura", "Let me talk about the cost a little bit. In the \u2013 again, let me back up and say within the play, Range has 700,000 high-graded acreage. And our acreage exists across the entire breadth, from the southwest up to the northeast part of the play and stuff in the middle. If you look at \u2013 and we've drilled vertical wells across that entire position, roughly 90 some total wells or whatever it is. If you look at the horizontal wells, by the let's say end of the third quarter, we'll have drilled horizontal wells across the entire position as well. And depending on where you drill will affect the cost of the wells. Like I said before, in the areas where these wells are, the depths are 6,000-6,500 feet deep. In a development mode, I think ultimately our costs will be approximately $3 million. As you get into the deeper parts of the play, 8,000 feet obviously, you're going to have to add some extra costs for the extra depth. But so far, I'm really excited about the rates. Our oldest well now has been on 250 days, production looks good. As you know, we're being cautious about what we say and what we can't say about it because we think we have a great position and we're an industry leader. We want to keep that for as long as we can and continue to grab acreage or snap up acreage that we think could really add a lot of value to our shareholders. So, that's what the cost of the wells are. And you also asked in terms of lateral and length. I think that kind of stuff, until the acreage is locked up, we're going to keep that information tight.", "Jack Aydin \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Rehan Rashid with FBR. Please proceed with your questions.", "Rehan Rashid \u2013 FBR", "On the rig count for the Marcellus, Jeff, what do you think of how much can you accelerate it between now, year end and sometime next year? And also generically speaking, is there any way to sum up lessons learned in the Marcellus from the first vertical well to the 63rd and the same thing for horizontal?", "Jeff Ventura", "How fast can we accelerate it? We'll probably keep roughly three rigs through the end of the year and drill about 40 horizontals this year. One thing I'd go back to, and again it's early, but when you get in a play where you have quality production and quality wells, you can build rates fairly efficiently without running a lot of rigs. And you can look at the other analogous shale plays, like the Barnett and the Fayetteville or even look specifically what Range has have been able to do in the Barnett, where we've grown rates to approaching 100 million per day and with really only running six to eight rigs, six or seven rigs at any point in time. As we go through the year, we certainly have the capacity in our team to run more rigs and to go faster. Like I said this year, though, parts of the play, obviously where we're drilling the quality wells, it looks like it's commercial, we're building infrastructure in those areas, that will be through this year.", "Next year, you're going to get the ramp up and that's really where you'll see the increase in the number of rigs that we're going to run. We'll come out in the fall or some time late in the year and talk about what we think that will be. Other parts of the play are still going to be being delineated with horizontal wells and we'll see what that is. And of course, the third we're doing is picking up acreage. As far as lessons learned, I would love to present to you and the industry and I guarantee we will at some point in time, all the lessons we learned. It will be great, (inaudible) papers, maybe a book some day, who knows. But, I can't say that right now. But, I would love to share that with you.", "Rehan Rashid \u2013 FBR", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jeff Hayden with Pritchard Capital Partners. Please proceed with your questions.", "Jeff Hayden \u2013 Pritchard Capital Partners", "Hi, guys. Jeff, I'd love for you to copy that book when you do write it.", "Jeff Ventura", "Pinkerton said he'll autograph it for you.", "Jeff Hayden \u2013 Pritchard Capital Partners", "Excellent. You talked about some of the wells that you guys have had on for awhile, 250 days or so. Can you give us any color on how that decline curve is looking relative to the Barnett, some of the other shale plays that people are working on these days?", "Jeff Ventura", "I really can't. Really, what everybody wants to know, at the end of the day, is how much do the wells cost, what are the reserves, what's the shape of the curve, therefore what are the rate of return and finding costs and to be able model that. We have all that information. Obviously, we're excited about the play in that we're continuing and we're building infrastructure in parts of it. We're picking up acreage and we think the play has a lot of upside. But until that is locked up and I hate to keep saying the same thing, we're just going to have to keep that information tight.", "Jeff Hayden \u2013 Pritchard Capital Partners", "Okay. Let me try one other one.", "Jeff Ventura", "When the acreage is locked up, we will share that and I can't wait to do it.", "Jeff Hayden \u2013 Pritchard Capital Partners", "Okay, great. Let me try one other quick one then. You said you'd have your acreage pretty much drilled up with horizontal wells by the fall. Can you give us a sense of how many different counties those kind of 11 horizontal wells you provided test rates on so far cover?", "Jeff Ventura", "Now, we really don't want to talk about where they are either. I might drill it up, I'm saying we'll have delineation wells in each of our key areas. We've already done that vertically and we will have done that horizontally by the fall. Then obviously, when you get into development mode, then you're going to have a lot of drilling in certain particular areas.", "Jeff Hayden \u2013 Pritchard Capital Partners", "Okay.", "John Pinkerton", "That being said, I think \u2013 this is John, I think the one thing that we've learned, this is kind of the lessons learned and I will give you kind Chapter 1, at least the first paragraph of Chapter 1. I think the one thing we've learned is that it's not all the same. One, that it's not all the same in terms of the other plays, the other shale plays. But also, within the Marcellus, we've found some pretty dramatic variability.", "Jeff Ventura", "Which I would add exists in the Barnett and exists in the Fayetteville and all of these other plays as well.", "John Pinkerton", "So, the thing I would be very careful about is I would not wave your hand over the entire Basin, 60 plus million acres and say it's all the same. Because the one thing we will say with heated agreement around the table here is, it's not all the same.", "Jeff Ventura", "Just like in the Barnett, if you are in Tarrant County and Johnson County, those tend to be better areas than a lot of the other ones.", "Jeff Hayden \u2013 Pritchard Capital Partners", "All right, guys, I appreciate it. Congrats again on a great quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Brad Olsen [ph] with Strome Investment Management Please proceed with your question.", "Brad Olsen \u2013 Strome Investment Management", "Good morning, guys. Can you hear me okay?", "John Pinkerton", "Yes, Brad.", "Brad Olsen \u2013 Strome Investment Management", "I just wanted to ask you a quick question. If you guys could give some color on kind of the direct operating costs? What percentage of those are fixed and what percentage do you guys have some ability to influence or put some pressure on? And also, insofar as there are discrepancies across the geographical regions that you operate, were there any areas that experienced high rates of increase in direct operating costs versus lower?", "Roger Manny", "Hi, Brad, this is Roger. I can try to field some of that for you. The big news on the operating cost front is that essentially when you take out the Gulf of Mexico assets that we sold last year, we're flat on an Mcfe basis last year to this year in the first quarter. So, we're real encouraged by that. We began to see some plateauing of our direct operating costs last year and we've been able to keep that plateau going.", "When you look at the actual individual components fixed versus variable, I can hit on a couple of high points for you. We finally kind of broke the back a little bit on saltwater hauling. It was down $0.02 for the quarter. We're up a tick on workovers. You'll see that in the press release. Contract pumpers were up $0.01. Well services were down $0.01. You've got a lot of ups and downs going on in our up cost categories and we do track all of these obviously very closely. But, as for the general direction, we're very pleased we've been able to keep it flat, and again our guidance is sort of in that mid $0.90 range for the rest of the year.", "John Pinkerton", "Just to add on, this is John, I think to move off the detail and move up a little bit just on that, I think if you think about the lease operating costs, there is a component in there that's salaries and wages. And I will say that the salaries and wages inflation in this business is pretty dramatic and it's with the field people all the way up through the technical staff. There is huge demand for those people. And our people plus everybody else is getting offers every day. So, we're seeing inflation in that and we're combating it by just trying to be a leader. And the good news is that since we issue equity to every single employee every year, there's a fair amount of walk-away value if they \u2013 that they're going to lose it if they walk away. So, that keeps people around for awhile. But at the end of the day, we've got to pay people competitively to keep them around. So, there will be pressure upward.", "In terms of fuel, the fuel and the electrical and stuff like that that are on the leases, we're all \u2013 just like your house, these producing wells aren't any different. You're seeing those kinds of things go up. The one thing I think we're seeing flatten pretty materially is the service side and again that's very local, depending where you are and everything. But, we've \u2013 the good news is that's I think, at least from our perspective, that has risen and now it's flattening out and I think that's one of the reasons why you saw our costs stay relatively flat there.", "The other thing I think is really important is that the \u2013 is as we continue to sell off what we call the more mature or higher cost assets, that will be a way to get more cost efficiency in terms of your lease operating costs. And last year, we sold some Gulf of Mexico assets that were high operating costs and we sold some chalk properties that were very high. The properties we just sold in East Texas, which were some shallow oil properties, but they were 98% water cut, those operating costs for example were well over $1.50 per Mcfe. ", "Now, it's still really high margins because it's oil, but that's a perfect example of where, if you really work this business hard and you're really disciplined and you really look at all of these different factors, which we do every month in our reviews, you can do some things that over a period of time will influence that. So, that's kind of a 50,000 foot.", "Brad Olsen \u2013 Strome Investment Management", "Great. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Carver with Capital One Southcoast. Please proceed with your question.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "Yes, I'm thinking about the 700,000 acres that you have versus the 1.15 million total net acres in Appalachia. With the vertical wells drilled across your acreage, is that \u2013 were those drilled across the 1.15 million acres and that's how you are able to high-grade to 700 or was that drilled across the 700 and almost all of that looks good?", "John Pinkerton", "Well, let me lead in and then I'll turn it over to Jeff, just so we can get the numbers right. Range owns and we have been in the basin for 35 plus years here. We own over 2 million acres in the basin, of which about 1.15 million we believe, based on the Marcellus fairway, fits into the Marcellus play, the 1.15. So, you go from a little over 2 million acres to 1.15 million being the Marcellus fairway, of which we've high-graded through a number of different means, which I'll turn over to Jeff in a second, down to the 700,000. So, that's the progression. Jeff?", "Jeff Ventura", "Yes, and that's an excellent point. And how we high-graded it, we actually have either drilled \u2013 of those 90 wells in the summer have been dispersed through that entire acreage position. And then in addition, remember like John said, that's the roots for our company. So, we actually have existing well bores, in some cases, we were able to test through a recompletion or plug back or relatively inexpensive deepening. So, it's a combination of all those things but we have a lot of control. Plus we have a lot of historical control as well by being in the Basin so long, a lot of data.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Eric Hagen with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Eric Hagen \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "I'm sorry. I forgot to queue. They've all been answered. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Nazir Bayet [ph] with Maurie Capital [ph]. Please proceed with your question.", "Nazir Bayet \u2013 Maurie Capital", "Good afternoon. I'd like to ask \u2013 John mentioned that there might be some more capital requirements. Are you guys looking to issue more stock in the near future?", "John Pinkerton", "Well, again we've got a Board meeting tomorrow and I'm one of eight Directors. So between Jeff and I, we've got a quarter of the votes. So, even if whatever we want to do, we've got to get the Board. But I think at the end of the day, when you step back and think about what our financial regimen is and what we said at the beginning of the year, is that we wanted our capital expenditures to equal our cash flow plus our asset sales. Because we want to stay financially regimented, we want to stay disciplined. And then, on the other side of it in terms of the acquisitions to the extent that we do some material acquisitions, obviously, we'll go to the capital markets.", "So, that is the framework with which we financially drive this Company. That being said, we've done some acquisitions. We're looking at additional opportunities especially in terms of the Marcellus and the acreage grab, if you want to call it that. And we will sit down with the Board tomorrow and get their input and then we'll make some decisions on whatever \u2013 however the Board wants us to go. Obviously, Jeff and I will have our recommendations to the Board and whatnot.", "But I think that should give you a framework in terms what we are doing. That being said, in terms of just directly answering the question, given \u2013 and I can only speak for myself because there are seven other directors. I would only issue equity if I knew that equity was going to be used in a way that \u2013 not in any way would dilute our \"upside per share\", Because I'm the largest individual shareholder and I can damn well sure tell you that we're not going to dilute our upside per share as long as I'm here.", "Nazir Bayet \u2013 Maurie Capital", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Mr. Joe Allman of JPMorgan for our final question. Please proceed with your question.", "Joe Allman \u2013 JPMorgan", "Great, thank you very much. Could you give us what you are seeing in terms of latest trends for drilling and completion costs? And in terms of the Barnett Shale acquisitions, I think you said there were two of them, could you give us the metrics there? What kind of productions did you buy, what kind of reserves you guys maybe bought, what kind of upside?", "Jeff Ventura", "In terms of costs both for rig rates and pumping services, in really all of our areas all four areas they are trending down, the only thing that's trending up right now is steel and tubulars, which have gone up significantly in the last few months. But remembering that those are a small part of the total well cost. So, the good news is costs are coming down. And not only are costs coming down but we've got strong technical teams and they're working hard to become more efficient in terms of how \u2013 reducing the number of days on well, quicker ways to drill.", "So, when you couple the more efficient drilling with costs coming down, that will really help improve our bang for the buck through capital. So the good news on the service side. And the other thing, just to tack on a little bit to the last question, the other thing we do as we got through the year obviously, we look at reallocating capital to our highest rate of return, best cash flow, most important projects and we continually high-grade that. The other thing \u2013 Range is rich in acreage but a lot of that acreage that we have clearly in all of our areas is held by production. So it gives us a lot of flexibility to shift capital around.", "John Pinkerton", "On the acquisitions, we did two acquisitions during the quarters I mentioned. The largest one, which is the one that we publicly disclosed was the \u2013 we bought some Barnett Shale properties from DTE, the Michigan utility. Those assets \u2013 when we closed the deal, and that was closed I think at the end of January, we're making right around about 12 million a day in production, somewhere in that area. And we \u2013 that's about $280 million. We think when you run through the numbers and run it all out, we bought those on a fully developed basis somewhere around $2. But again, now we've got to develop it out and Whitley and the team are doing a good job. We just drilled a couple of nice wells that we'll get on production there.", "The other acquisition was a smaller transaction, about $30 million. That was really pretty interesting because it's a nice piece of acreage, not too far to the northeast of our Carter Industrial Park. As you all recall, we drilled I think one of the best wells ever drilled in the Barnett at about 12 million a day initial rate. So that little deal was somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 acres. It essentially had a couple of producing wells on it but fairly marginal wells. They were drilled by a smaller operator and we think \u2013 our team, quite frankly, just thinks we can do a better job of drilling and completing in there and it has substantial upside. So, it's really hard to tell on that one. That one, we really didn't buy for the proved reserves for any reason.", "And when you look at us in the Barnett, that's really how we're going to make money in the Barnett. We're going to drill up 100,000 acres. But we're not going to be super competitive on buying properties for their proved reserves. Where we're going to make money is where we can identify opportunities, to find things that are not proved and make them proved in a very timely basis that will create significant value for our shareholders. And to be honest with you, that is really across all of our projects, quite frankly. We are not going to be in the business of buying proved reserves. We're going to be in the business because we just think that's \u2013 it's just too costly. If we're going to try to keep paying development cost structure in the top quartile in the industry, I don't think you can do it by simply buying proved reserves, given the cost of proved reserves today.", "Joe Allman \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, appreciate that. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Pinkerton for his concluding remarks.", "John Pinkerton", "Thank you, operator. I think in summary, I think the key here is, there's obviously been a kind of a firestorm of information and goings on in terms of the Marcellus Shale play. And as Jeff said, we're keenly interested in it. We obviously have committed a fair amount of capital over the last several years and have got what I think is a leading team up in Pittsburgh that will be approaching 100 people here very shortly, and we're really excited about that play. That being said, it is not the only play at Range that we are interested in. This is a portfolio company. What drove first quarter results was this portfolio. It was each division doing as well, if not better, than the business plan for the year. So, I want to congratulate each one of those divisions.", "And the other thing I want to just make it clear to you, essentially none of this production increase was related to the Marcellus. Essentially, all of our Marcellus production after we test these wells is essentially shut in awaiting infrastructure. So, all of that increase was driven by these other plays, in particular the Barnett, in particular Nora, but also our Tonkawa play in Oklahoma, our Furman play in West Texas and some of the other plays in Nora and Virginia, which is still my favorite field because I think it has some of the best economics and it will have the best economics for the next 30 years. And we're still just peeling back the onion there.", "So again, although the Marcellus is getting enormous coverage and obviously it deserves it given the potential, the one thing that I am keenly focused on and Jeff and I are connected to the hip here, we're focused on developing the upside and that's important. But we were also I think more focused on delivering every quarter. Because we think at the end of the day, what's really going to drive this stock price is delivering each and every quarter. Our cash flow was up almost 50% year-over-year. If you just take the $1.57 and multiply it times four, which is pretty simple math and I wouldn't \u2013 you've got to be smarter than that. But if you just do those numbers and look at those \u2013 that cash flow number versus where the analysts have it, it's obviously significantly higher.", "So, we're in the business focused on developing \u2013 of creating the upside. But the real key here is taking that upside and getting it through the income statement and getting into something that's called shareholders equity, and that's really what we are focused on. I would really \u2013 when you look at companies to buy and sell, I think the real key here is not only do they have the upside and whatnot, but how good are they at taking this upside and developing it and getting it into the income statement and getting stockholders equity. And that's really the hard part of this business to do that quarter in and quarter out.", "And again, as I say every conference that I attend and that my favorite slide in our presentation is the one where we had 21 consecutive quarters of sequential production growth because that really is what drives our business. That coupled with Roger's favorite slide, which is the cost slide, where we've been one of the top quartile F&D and LOE companies in our peer group for a long time. And so, when you take those two and you couple that together with the upside that Jeff and the team have put together, not only the Marcellus, but also the Nora play, which is just really tremendous. ", "And then, Whitley and his guys have done in the Barnett and continue to do in the Barnett. I mean, Jeff mentioned that we drilled a 5 million a day well in Parker County. That is stunning. There aren't that many 5 million a day wells drilled in Parker County. And the reason that was done, we accomplished that, because it's clearly not as good a rock as the rock in Tarrant and Johnson County. It just shows you the quality of the team. And again, in this business, it all gets back to the quality of the team and it's not just the people sitting around this table. It's really the 750 employees we have at Range that are really working hard each and every day. And the good news, they are benefiting because they're all stockholders.", "So, why don't we terminate the call. Thank you very much for joining us and we'll be \u2013 if you didn't get \u2013 if you tried to ask a question and didn't get the opportunity, feel free to call Rodney and anybody else on our team or Jeff and I or Rodney will be happy to spend some time with you and get those questions answered. Again, thank you very much for joining us and we look forward to seeing you or talking to you again at the end of the second quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

(Operator Instructions) ", "Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. ", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to David Amend, Investor Relations Manager of Range Resources. ", "David Amend ", "Range reported results for the second quarter of 2008 posting our 22 consecutive quarter of sequential production growth even during the challenging quarter. We have posted on our website supplemental tables to assist you in understanding many of the number in the press release.", "In the press release, we have furnished some non-GAAP statements, which allow you to compare our results to our historically reported numbers, which include the Gulf of Mexico operations that we sold during 2007, and in table five of the supplemental tables, we have presented a summary of the reported numbers, which correspond to the analyst's models taking out the non-cash items. ", "On the call with me today are John Pinkerton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Operating Officer and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before turning the call over to John, I would like to cover a few administrative items. First, we did file our 10-Q with the SEC this morning. It is available on the home page of our website or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. ", "In addition, we have posted on our website supplemental tables which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of our non-GAAP earnings, to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today. Tables are also posted on the website that will give you detailed information on our current hedge position by quarter.", "We have also updated on investor presentation to reflect information that would be discussed on today\u2019s call and it will be available on our website tomorrow. Second we will be participating in several conferences in August and September, check our website for complete listing. We will be at the intercom energy conference in Denver on August 10, and the Lehman CEO energy conference in New York City on September 2nd. Now let me turn the call over to John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks David. Rodney Waller as many of you all know isn\u2019t with us today due to a illness in his family but he\u2019ll back with shortly. Before Roger reviews the second quarter results, I\u2019ll review the key accomplishment so far this year. On a year-over-year basis second quarter production rose 22% meeting the high-end of our guidance by $6 million today. ", "As David mentioned this marks the 22nd consecutive quarters of sequential production growth. The driver of the higher than expected production was exceptional performance by really all of the divisions, as you recall I mentioned that in the first quarter it was one of those rare quarters where, everything went right essentially nothing went wrong. For the second quarter we were now as fortunate and that we had a number of issues we had to overcome. Most significantly we had on average $18.5 million a day of Barnett production shut in due to the third party pipeline curtailments.", "To offset the shut in production, our operating teams reshuffled the drilling schedule, performed numerous work over, fast forward well turn on and pulled many rabbits our of the hat, so to speak. I\u2019m extremely proud of their performance and more publicly thanks them for extending our production growth to 22 consecutive quarters. On our drilling program, we remained on schedule throughout the quarter and we drilled about 180 wells. We continue to be extremely pleased with the drilling results which Jeff will talk about a number of the wells. We are drilling really fantastic rate of returns and there currently we\u2019ve got 30 rigs running. ", "The 22% increase in production coupled with the 17% increased in realized prices, drove up cash flow $121 million. This is $64 million or 41% higher than the second quarter of last year, since it was a terrific quarter, by posting record production volumes in the benefit of strong commodity prices, clearly we set the stage for a another record year for Range. ", "Because of the shut in production and the extra cost we incurred to overcome the shut in coupled with the continue ramp up in personnel, in our Marcellus shale plan in Appalachia. Our unit costs were higher versus the prior year. Once we get the Barnett production back on, which should happens sometime by the end of the year and the Marcellus gas on, we are confident our per-unit cost will drop back down to historical levels. ", "With regard to the, merging plays a heck of a lot of - headway was made in the second quarter as we mentioned in the press release as Jeff\u2019s going to talk about. We drilled some terrific wells, we continue to expand our acreage positions and our infrastructure projects are on track and look really good. In addition, we continue to build out our technical teams, especially with regard to the Marcellus and really given a great advantage and I think the quality of well speak to that. ", "At the end of the day, I really couldn\u2019t be more pleased with what we have accomplished so far in the year. It's a real testimony to everybody of Range. With that Roger why don\u2019t you review the financial results?", "Roger Manny", "Thank you, John. The second quarter of 2008 proved to be true to its name as we have recorded the second highest quarterly oil and gas sales, second highest quarterly EBITDAX, and the second highest quarterly cash flow in our history. For oil and gas sales, including cash settled derivates, were 313 million, 42% higher than the second quarter of last year.", "EBITDAX for the quarter, came in at $244 million, 41% higher than the second quarter of \u201907 and cash flow was $221 million also 41% higher than last year second quarter. The strong quarterly performance was driven by a 22% year-over-year quarterly production increase and a 17% higher year-over-year quarterly average oil and gas price. ", "Interestingly, the second quarter of this year unfolded just like the second quarter of last year. The first quarter of \u201908 and \u201907 both set new record quarterly highest for oil and gas revenues, EBITDAX and cash flow and in both years this first record quarter was followed by a second quarter of second best results. So while production continues to head up into the right, the second quarter 2008 realized oil and gas price per Mcfe of $9.03 was 5.5% below the $9.55 price realized in the first quarter of this year. ", "The second quarter 2008 cash margins was $6.34 per Mcfe - $6.37 per Mcfe 17% higher than the second quarter of \u201907. As per net income oil and gas companies that hedged their production to protect their cash flow had a tough second quarter in \u201908 and Range was no exception. ", "Net income was impacted by several non-cash expenses, first the non-cash 164 million mark-to-market loss on our unrealized oil and gas hedges. Second our non-cash $7.5 million mark-to-market expense, due to the increase in Range\u2019s stock price and third a non-cash $5.3 million reduction in unproved leasehold value.", "The 2008, second quarter GAAP net loss was $35 million compared to prior year of second quarter GAAP net income of $64 million. Quarterly earnings calculated as analysts do, were $75 billion or $0.48 per fully diluted share, compared to the analyst estimate of $0.54 per share and the difference was $5.3 million in non cash acreage expirations which were included in DD&A this quarter. ", "Because the mark-to-markets forward price curves for oil and gas have declined since the quarter end, for illustrated purposes we remark-to-market our quarter end hedge position using the closing oil and gas prices from last night, July 23. We discovered that had oil and gas prices at the end of the quarter been the same as they were from yesterday, the non-cash $164 million pre-tax mark-to-market loss would have been completely eliminated. ", "Our cash flow per diluted share this quarter was $1.41 matching the analyst consensus. As always please visit the Range Resource\u2019s website for a full reconciliation of all these non-GAAP measures including cash flow of EBITDAX, adjusted net income and cash margins.", "Cash direct operating costs for the second quarter of \u201908 was $1.05 per Mcfe compared to $0.96 in the first quarter of this year and $0.86 last year. There are several unusual items embedded in this higher cost figure, the largest of which is $0.05 per Mcfe associated with shut-in Barnett gas production. The shut in wells still require maintenance and incur expense even though they are not producing. ", "Also work over expense for the second quarter was $0.10 per Mcfe and that\u2019s up $0.06 from the first quarter and $0.07 from last year. Adjusting for these items cash direct operating costs would have been $0.96 consistent with our mid to high $0.90 range cost guidance previously provided. Looking forward, we expect cash direct operating expense to run in the high $0.90 range to the rest of the year. ", "General and administrative expense adjusted for non-cash stock comp expense was $0.49 per Mcfe for the second quarter up from the $0.44 figure in the second quarter of last year. G&A expense like direct operating expense suffered in the second quarter due to higher payroll costs and the production curtailment that John mentioned.", "To illustrate the point we now have over 70 full time professionals on our Marcellus team on the ground in Appalachian, building a terrific acreage position, drilling excellent wells, but producing very little gas until the infrastructure is completed, and this is a temporary unit costs increase that reflects the reality of developing a world class resource from scratch as opposed to buying existing production.", "Placed in the proper prospective, trading a nickel in short-term G&A expense for finding development and acquisition costs that are dollars below industry average is a good trade for the shareholders. Cash G&A expense will likely remain in the high $0.40 range per Mcfe for the rest of the year. ", "Second quarter interest expense was $0.69 per Mcfe flat with the first quarter of this year and $0.07 higher than the second quarter of last year and as we\u2019ve continued to increase our debt level and periodically refinance our short-term floating rate bank debt with fixed rate 10 years subordinated notes our interest expense has increased. So expect interest expense per Mcfe to run in the low to mid $0.70 range for the rest of \u201908.", "Exploration expense for the second quarter of \u201908 excluding non-cash topics was $18 million, that\u2019s $8 million higher than the second quarter of last year mostly due to a $6 million increase in seismic expense and it\u2019s been a while since I mentioned it, but please remember that Range does not capitalize any EBITs exploratory or developmental seismic expenses. So they ebb and flow of our seismic activity that timing flows straight through to the bottom line. ", "Now we anticipate that quarterly expiration expense including non-cash comp will approximate $20 million to $22 million per quarter for the rest of the year. That depends of course on our ongoing drilling success and the timing of seismic purchases.", "Depreciation, depletion and amortization per Mcfe for the second quarter of \u201908 was $2.24 compared to $1.81 from the second quarter of last year. Of this $2.24 figure $1.95 represents depletion expense, the same as last quarter while $0.14 is attributable to depreciation and accretion expense and as previously mentioned $0.15 or $5.3 million came from leasehold expirations. Our core depletion rates should remain in the $1.95 per Mcfe range for the rest of the year. ", "Reductions in unproved acreage values are more difficult to predict. However, we do expect to incur $5 million to $8 million per quarter in unproved acreage value reductions primarily from expirations going forward as we continue to drill on a high-grade our acreage portfolio. So, DD&A with the ongoing acreage expirations should run $2.24 to $2.27 per Mcfe for the reminder of the year.", "For the six month year-to-date \u201908 period oil and gas sales plus settled derivatives totaled $635 million up 42% from the $449 million during the first six months of \u201907. EBITDAX for the first six months of \u201908 was $509 million, up 44% from last year and cash flow increased to $462 million, 45% higher in \u201908 compared to the $318 million figure from last year.", "The balance sheet was substantially strengthened during the second quarter through two transactions. First we issued 4.4 million new common shares generating $282 million in proceeds which was used to repay bank debt incurred earlier in the year to fund Barnett Shale acquisitions. Second we refinanced part of our short-term bank debt $250 million of 7.25% 10 year subordinated notes.", "Now, with the issuance of equity our debt-to-cap ratio was reduced back below our 40% target, but rose to 43% at the end of the quarter due to the $279 million of negative of the comprehensive income that we recorded due to our hedged position. Range ended the quarter with nearly $800 million in unused committed bank facility funding and we had a $1.3 billion in unused bank borrowing base capacity. We have our strongest balance sheet in recent memory. ", "As John mentioned, at the start of the call, the first quarter of \u201908 was one of those rare quarters when virtually everything went right nothing went wrong and every part of Range organization exceeded their targets. The second quarter of \u201908 was not this type of a quarter. Our production curtailments in the Barnett and the need to right size the Marcellus team before infrastructure completion have temporarily increased our unit cost structure, but this should not obscure the fact that top line year-over-year quarterly oil and gas revenue growth is 42% and we have posted 41% year-over-year quarterly EBITDAX and cash flow hereof. ", "Lastly the balance sheet was substantially improved during the quarter and Range has more than enough liquidity to execute it\u2019s operating strategy going forward. With that John I\u2019ll turn it back to you.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks Roger. That was an excellent update. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff Ventura to review our exploration and development activities. Jeff?", "Jeff Ventura", "", "Thanks John. I'll begin by reviewing production. For the second quarter, production averaged $381 million per day to 22% increase over the second quarter of 2007 and then 3% increase over the first quarter of 2008. This represents the highest quarterly production rate in the company's history and the 22nd consecutive quarter of sequential production growth.", "Let's now review three of our key projects. First, I'll start with the Barnett Shale in the Fort Worth Basin. During the second quarter we experienced curtailments in the Barnett and they were significant. At times we had a well over $30 million per day shut-in. The good new is that despite that we were still able to beat our production target. We were able to do that because of the strength of our portfolio of opportunities and more importantly because we have a team that consistently rises to the occasion and delivers.", "The curtailment situation in the Barnett is improving with the start up of a new gathering/transmission line with the take away capacity of $300 million per day scheduled for later in the third quarter. Another line with additional take away capacity in excess of $700 million per day is scheduled to start off late in the fourth quarter.", "Currently, we have six rigs running in the Barnett. Net production is about $90 million per day today and in addition to that we currently have about $22 million per day shut-in. Despite the shut-ins we are still projecting 19% production growth for Range for 2008. ", "Range currently has a 109,000 net acres in the Barnett Shale play, 42,000 net acres on Tarrant, Johnson Denton, Eastern Parker, Eastern Hood, Northwest Ellis and Southwest Ellis Counties. This is the prudent part of the play and we still have over 700 locations to drill on these areas. That assumes 500 foot spacing, which equates to about 40 acres per well. It also assumes 15% of the acreages developed on 250 foot spacing which may prove to be conservative. This represents 1.2 Tcf of net un-booked upside in the Barnett.", "We also have 51,000 net acres in Hill and Southwest and Ellis counties which represents an additional 0.8 Tcf of upside. Combined this is about 2 Tcf which by itself is almost double the size of Range. The recent highlights of our Barnett drilling program are our last four wells in the Carter Industrial Park. They tested at a combined rate of $33 million per day gross or 25 net. That\u2019s an average of $8 million per day per well, which is outstanding.", "We also made significant progress reducing our well costs in Eastern Hood County. Our last four wells averaged 10 days from spud to rig release. The cost of chasing point was about $500 and the total completed well cost was about $1.6 million. These wells averaged 2 Bcfe per well, so they have excellent F&D costs well below $1 and great rates of return. Our first well in Northwestern Ellis County came on line at the rate of $2.6 million day and also we previously announced the $5 million per day well in Eastern Parker County.", "Our second Southwest Ellis County well was just like the first one. It had good thickness in gas in place but produced at a sub par rate of $1.3 per day. Our Hill County drilling is similar, good thickness in gas in place but disappointing production rates for the initial wells. We still have some experimentation to do though and we\u2019re making progress. Our last well produced at an initial rate of $2.4 million per day. ", "The other thing will seeing in Hill and Ellis Counties is that although the initial rates are lower, the decline rates are lower than the core of the Barnett. If we can replicate our latest well, we can generate good F&D and good rates of return. The key is our high quality team headed up by Mark Whitley. I\u2019m optimistic that they\u2019ll be able to solve the formula and unlock the gas. ", "Another very impactful low risk project for us is our Nora area located in Virginia in the Appalachian Basin. This is another project that has the potential to double Ranges reserves. There is significant upside in all the three horizons in Nora, coal bed methane, tight gas sands and the Huron Shale.", "Range continues to drill successful CBM and tight gas sand wells in the field. F&D cost nets Range continued to be around a $1, which is amongst the lowest in the country. In addition the wells produced very little water and have low lift cost. Given this location in the Appalachian Basin, these wells received premium to NYMEX. This in combination with low F&D and low LOEs results in very good rates of return for these wells. Given a large number of wells to be drilled in current spacing and assuming successful down spacing, which it appears that it\u2019s happening, there are approximately 6,000 wells left to drill.", "The latest development in Nora is horizontal drilling in the Huron Shale. Our first well, which was completed in the fourth quarter last year, came online at an initial rate of $1.1 million per day. It cost about $1.2 million to drill and complete and although it's still early initial reserve are about 1 Bcf. Given our working interest and net revenue interest and remembering that Range owns the minerals, our net finding and development cost is about $1.07 per Mcf. This year, we expect to be drilling 10 horizontal delineation wells across the 250,000 Nora block.", "We know that the Huron Shale has a good thickness and gas content across the 250,000 acres because there are 107 producing vertical Huron Shale wells on this acreage. The purpose of the 10 horizontal delineation wells is to verify that horizontal drilling is an effective way to economically develop these reserves. If the Huron wells are successful, they will de-risk about 1 Tcf of net gas reserves to Range by year end. ", "We recently just completed our first three horizontal shale well in our 2008 program, two of these wells are inline; one of the wells had an initial rates of $1.2 million per day. This well had a 3200ft lateral and was completed with eight stages. The other well had drilling difficulties which resulted in only 17 19ft of lateral. This well had an initial rate of 565 Mcf per day. The difference in rate is proportional for lateral length. ", "So far I\u2019m encouraged with the Huron Shale potential in the Nora field. Net project will be starting at Nora\u2019s horizontal development in the Brea sandstones which we believe has excellent potential on our acreage as well and the Brea is on of the existing type gas sands that we\u2019ve been developing vertically for years in our excellent wells. ", "And other high impact opportunity for Range is on Marcellus shale plane in the northern part of the Appalachian basin. Last week we announced that we have now 1.4 million acres of Marcellus Shale acreage. We believe our high graded acreage now stands at 850,000 acres which equates at 15 to 22 Tcfe of net un-risked reserve potential. Of that 10 to 15 Tcfe are located in the Southwest of the play with the remainder in the northeast. To date we have drilled and completed 22 horizontal Marcellus Shale wells and have an additional three horizontal wells waiting on completion. ", "In yesterday\u2019s release we announced our last seven horizontal completions which had an initial production rates that averaged 4.9 million per day. This compares to 4.1 million per day for the 10 wells prior to that. Range also recently announced these well should costs $3 million to $4 million in the development mode and we expect reserves to be 3 to 4 Bcfe per well. That generates finding and development cost of $0.90 to a $1.60 per Mcfe. We have also announced an agreement with MarkWest to develop the midstream infrastructure and we\u2019ve also announced that to date we have secured firm capacity on the pipelines with $150 million per day and are currently negotiating for additional capacity.", "In terms of water source and water disposal require to hydraulically fracture Marcellus wells, Range is making excellent progress in handling these requirements for our projects. It\u2019s interesting to note that Pennsylvania second only to Alaska in terms of water resources. We continue to work within the states regulations to securities these water sources and have made excellent progress. We\u2019ve also recently signed four agreements with existing regulatory approved water disposal facilities that should more than handle our water disposal requirements for the next several years.", "Our current focus is to begin development of our core areas, continue to delineate our acreage and aggressively add to our Marcellus leasehold in selected areas. We currently have three rigs running and we\u2019ll drill approximately 40 horizontal Marcellus Shale wells this year. 2008 will primarily be a year of delineation, acreage acquisition and building infrastructure. We expect significant volume growth will occur in 2009 and beyond.", "In addition to pursuing the Marcellus Shale we\u2019ve also initiated studies on the Utica Shale, Berquette, Genesse and Limestreet Shales. There is good potential for all of these horizons on our existing acreage in the Appalachian Basin. Range now owns 2.7 million growth, 2.3 million net acreage of leasehold in Appalachian. I\u2019d like to switch gears and talk about the curtailments that we had in the second quarter and things we did to overcome them. ", "Range has a strong portfolio of projects that we draw on when we are confronted with challenges and the high quality team that consistently rises to the occasion. For the second quarter both the Midcontinent and Appalachian teams rose to the occasion. In the Midcontinent the team drove some very good wells in the Granite Wash and the Texas Panhandle and also in the Watonga, Chickasha area.", "In particular the Granite Wash is developing into a very nice opportunity for Range. Currently it looks like we have an excess of 200 Granite Wash wells drilled in three different places. Two are on the Texas Panhandle and one is in Western Oklahoma. One is a horizontal Granite Wash play on the Southern part of our portion ranch area. The Granite Wash target zone here is about 50 feet thick and the wells are about 9300 feet true vertical depth.", "The wells come online at about $2 million to $3 million per day. The other Texas Panhandle Granite Wash play southeast of there, where the Granite Wash is over 600 feet thick. This is a vertical development and the wells are about 12,000 feet deep and come online at rates of $2.5 million to more than $3 million per day.", "In addition to achieving good drilling results, the Midcontinent team also cramped up the re-completion or work over effort. The best one of the bunch was the re-completion to our Douglas zone in a well and quotient ranch. This re-completion cost about $400,000 and resulted in a strong well that came online at the rate of $6.6 million per day and its still producing at about that rate.", "The Midcontinent team also optimized the pumping at some of our oil wells in northern Oklahoma, by changing the steel rods for fiberglass rods. This increased the oil production of our well there. The best results from an individual well resulted in a gain of more than 100 barrels of oil per day. We\u2019ve also optimized gas gathering there which increased production by more than a million per day.", "The Appalachian team also stepped up and helped the company to achieve our results. In particular, our team in Virginia did a great job of drilling some exceptional high gas sand wells, the five gas wells, but particularly noticed a big line well at Nora they came online at a rate of $2 million per day and it\u2019s still a very strong producer. Prior to that and noteworthy is the Ravenscliff well that drilled and came online at $2.4 million per day and it\u2019s also a very strong producer.", "In the northern part of the basin, the teams drilled two exceptional Beakmantown well, that combine and were inline at about $2 million per day. There are numerous small projects across all of the divisions that when combined overcame came the shut-ins and resulted in beating our production target and posting our 22nd consecutive quarter of production growth. That did come with a cost however. If we were not at being curtailed had not had the scrambled over comment, we would have lowered our LOE by about $0.06 per Mcf for the quarter.", "Clearly we would choose not to be curtailed. At this point in time though, we know that today we have 22 million cubic feet per day shut-in. By year-end all of that should be back online. Although we\u2018ve experienced curtailments during the third quarter, we still should produce about 384 million to 386 million cubic feet equivalent per day and post our 23rd consecutive quarter growth. ", "The fourth quarter should be 395 million to 400 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which will gives us our 24th quarter of growth and 19% production growth for the year. 2009 should start out strong with the ramp up in the Marcellus Shale production. We\u2019re targeting 30 million per day from the first quarter of 2009. ", "To summarize Range is in a great position. We have a proven reserve base of 2.2 Tcfe. On top of that we have identified upside of between 20.5 to 22 or 28.2 Tcfes, primarily a lower as coal bed methane, shale gas and tight gas sand place. We have a great track record of converting that to value for our shareholders. Range is where we want it to be, a low cost producer with a lot of low risk built-in growth. In summary we are in a terrific position to continue to build shareholder value on into the future. Back to you John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks Jeff, terrific update. Looking to the second half of \u201908, we see continued strong operating and financial results. As Jeff mentioned for the third quarter, we\u2019re looking for production to come in at approximately 384 million to 386 million a day, that\u2019s 18% higher than the prior year. With higher production and strong process, we again anticipate third quarter revenues cash flow and earnings will be substantially higher than the prior period. ", "Looking to the third quarter we anticipate production to continue to increase. It should be in the range of $395 million to $400 million equivalence a day. Given what we know today we anticipate that the shale-in production, bio-production to come in by the end of the year after the pipeline expansions are completed. I think the key point here is that we still currently anticipate reaching our 19% production growth target for the year despite the shut in from the Barnett, so I think that\u2019s really good news. ", "Due to the higher volumes and the prices for the year cash flow from operations anticipate to increase by more than 30% over 2007. So as you can see 2008 should be a tremendous year financially for Range and its shareholders.", "While we focused on having our wells drilled and hitting our quarterly production targets we also continue to expand our drilling inventory and make exciting progress with our emerging plays. As you heard form Jeff our technical teams have drilled some additional high rig wills in several different plays with regards to the Marcellus Shale play, in particular the 4.9 million average test rig from our most recent seven wells is extremely encouraging.", "Given our success and the additional opportunities we have identified we\u2019ll move quickly and aggressively. Our expanded Marcellus team gives us the ability to be aggressive; however we\u2019ll maintain our disciplined approach and financial regimen. ", "Importantly our gas gathering and processing infrastructure projects in the Marcellus are making solid process and we\u2019re right on track. We\u2019re right on tract to begin ramping up our Marcellus production in the first quarter of \u201909. We\u2019re also on track to significantly increase our Marcellus drilling activity in 2009 and beyond as we\u2019ve tied up additional drilling rigs as well as the water infrastructure.", "As Jeff mentioned we recently execute four additional agreements regarding the water source and disposal. These arrangements coupled with our existing arrangements will give us plenty of running room in terms of that part of our business. Of the pipeline and infrastructure we have, we\u2019ve made arrangements that provide for a considerable take away capacity, so when you think about the way we look at it while our water and pipeline issue may limit some of the operators in the play, these issues shouldn\u2019t limit us given the actions that we\u2019ve already taken, so we feel really good about that. ", "For those of you that have been shareholders when we initiated the Marcellus play you\u2019re trust and patients is very close to paying off as we are just around the corner from seeing material production volumes and cash flows from this exciting play. There is no doubt in my mind that the Marcellus Shale plays will be a key driver to the value of Range for many years to come. ", "In summary, looking our Range today we have the largest drilling inventory in our history with over 11,000 projects. Our inventory together with our emerging plays represents 21 to 28 Tcf of future growth potential. This equates to 9 to 13 times our existing proved reserves. We are excited about the growth potential of Range and we\u2019re intently focused on delivering each and every quarter.", "The second quarter in particular is a shining example of this commitment by all the employees at Range. Prior to opening up the call to questions, I would like to make one final comment. I want to show all of our shareholders that we\u2019re maintaining our sharp focus on per share value. As I mentioned many times at Range we care about our stock price not our market capitalization. ", "Several acquisitions have recently been announced in which we participated in the bidding process. We lost out on those acquisitions because we were unwilling to undertake acquisitions that make us bigger but don\u2019t result at any higher per share value. No matter how much we lack at property, we will not buy unless it clearly increases our per share value. ", "This disciplined approach is built on our confidence that we can continue to deliver double digit growth at low costs for many years to come with our existing portfolio of properties. While we continue to take acquisitions we will do so only when we believe, it benefits our existing shareholders by making those shares more valuable. With that operator let we open up the call to questions.", "Question and answer session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Joe Allman with J.P. Morgan. ", "Joseph Allman - J.P. Morgan ", "John or Jeff, those four agreements in the Marcellus Shale for water handling just to clarify so those would give you water access and will also take care of you for water disposal; could you talk about those and how long is that going to last for and what are the geographic areas covered there?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "", "Yes, the agreements are both for water procurement and for water disposal, it will take of us for the next few years and of course along with that in parallel we\u2019ll continue to pursue, otherwise in additional ways optimize handling of water, but our teams has done a great job there. We are looking at not just drilling wells but we\u2019re looking at the sources of water, the uses of water, gathering system, pipelines, firm transportation, procuring drilling rigs, pumping services and all the things that we need like John said to carry out our program for the next several years. ", "We\u2019ve got multiple areas we\u2019re looking at developing and those agreements will cover multiple areas. As I bet a lot of people know we have great acreage position, we\u2019re drilled when you\u2019re adding all of our wells, close to a 100 well, now veridical and horizontal and cross and Marcellus plus we have all the control points from all Appalachia wells that were drilled, the good Chesapeake wells that they announced as well as others, so we\u2019ve got multiple areas. ", "We think from the perspective some of our drilling this time, we\u2019ve drilled some really significant stepped out well along ways from each other. So we\u2019re developing a lot of areas, but as you\u2019re aware of and I think most of you are aware of a lot of our initial drilling and development is going to come in the Southwest parts.", "Joseph Allman - J.P. Morgan ", "And can you talk about any other regulatory or environmental issues that you need to confront in developing this play?", "Jeff Ventura ", "We\u2019re constantly working with all of the agencies out there and we think we are going down all of the paths we need to go down. Yes, I think that at the end of the day, it\u2019s not just a great opportunity for Range it\u2019s great opportunity for the state of Pennsylvania. ", "Just like the Barnett Shale here and the Fort Worth Basin has created close to a 100,000 jobs. I think we have the potential to create more than that up in Pennsylvania. So, it\u2019s going to be a great opportunity for job creation and great opportunity for bringing a lot of industry in there, wells for the land owners and the mineral owners, as well as it\u2019s a good deal for the country. It\u2019s natural gas, it\u2019s clean burning, it\u2019s a domestic fuel, so we\u2019re talking to State and local people constantly and we think we\u2019re making and building good relationships. ", "Unlike all projects, there maybe bumps along the way, but we think we\u2019re along ways down the road and importantly like we\u2019ve talked about we are going to come on in the significant way in the first quarter. We expect production to reach, 30 million per day in the first quarter we expect to ramp up to 8 rigs sometime in 2008 and continue to drive our volumes up in significant ways. We\u2019re securing more additional firm capacity beyond a 130 million a day; we\u2019re well in excess of the 150 million per day that we talked about. So we are excited about the project and just like in the Barnett here the guys have done a great job. ", "With just 6 rigs we grow production up in the Barnett to close to a 100 per day and if you add in the shut volumes which will occur, we\u2019ll get all of those volumes back online by the end of the year. We\u2019re going to be a well over a $120 million per day in that just running six rigs in a two year timeframe, so planning on going to eight rigs, initially in the Marcellus, but those are the things what we\u2019ll find too in the August, September and this fall and towards the end of the year and early next year. We\u2019ll continue to putout more updates in terms of the play.", "Joseph Allman - J.P. Morgan", "That $30 million in the first quarter of \u201909, so that\u2019s not an average rate that\u2019s just a level that you will reach at some point during the quarter, is that right?", "Jeff Ventura ", "Yes, but I\u2019m confident of our guys will hit that and continue to drive it up.", "Joseph Allman - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and then on the Barnett, are you expecting to grow the Barnett between now and the time you get those pipeline initiatives or it\u2019s going to be relative flats and then if so what\u2019s really going on the drive, what areas are going to drive the production growth?", "Jeff Ventura ", "That\u2019s really important and one of the comments I wanted to get across in this call. Quite frankly I think a lot of people there have though a few things where you guys have the Carter Industrial Park, it\u2019s great, but it\u2019s only 2000 acres and there\u2019s not a lot of drilling and you have to drill in Ellis County, that\u2019s really not true. We have a really significant position in the Barnett, and like I said we\u2019ve got 42,000 acres and more than 700 wells on conservative spacing assumptions of 40 acres or better. They\u2019re right in the guts of the play. ", "On our website, which David is going to update and it will be out I believe tomorrow or not later than Monday, we\u2019re going to highlight some of those other areas. There\u2019ll actually be specific slides up on our website showing what we\u2019re doing in Eastern Parker or Eastern Hood, Southern County, Southeast County, some more Johnson County drilling, that have really nothing to do with the expansionary. ", "So, when you look at the curtailments the whole play isn\u2019t curtailed. Really all the curtailments we\u2019ve experienced today are just in the Carter Industrial Park. So, the answer is yes, Mark Whitley and his team are going to continue drive up production and working with the pipeline companies we\u2019re going to get all that on by the end of the year. ", "There\u2019s two big programs, that\u2019s ETC\u2019s Paris line that\u2019s supposed to come on literally sometime within the next 30 days, take away capacity of 300 million per day and then the other one is Crawley line, which will be online by the end of the year. They could add depending on what pressure you\u2019re pumping, 700 million to up to 1 Bcf per day and it has not going to come on all at once, it will come on in parts starting in September and October and through November. ", "So, we\u2019ll be drilling in the Barnett and areas where we\u2019re currently not curtailed, but when the curtailments comeback on we\u2019re going to get that production. Just like I said in my notes it\u2019s a negative thing that we were curtailed, but since it happened now you can view it as a positive. We\u2019ve got 22 million of per day that\u2019s literally just opening wells to get it back online, no additional costs, no additional effort other than the third party pipelines that are going to put in place.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rehan Rashid with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. Please proceed with your question.", "Rehan Rashid - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &Co.,", "", "On the Marcellus from a water standpoint I thought I read in Halliburton earnings transcript that they might be looking into something that would allow you to use Brine rather than portable water; does that kind of ring a bill, any thoughts there?", "Jeff Ventura", "Yes it\u2019s a good point. There is a lot of technological things that are in the process that can really help out. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re planning for existing conditions as it exists and we\u2019ll have enough capacity for current technology, but what we\u2019re right on to referring to is the big issue with reusing frac water is friction reducers don\u2019t work in the sailing water. ", "The service companies all are working on the technology to come up with friction reducers that will work in sailing water. If that\u2019s true then we can really reuse a lot of the frac water, so there is real upside in terms of technology that\u2019ll come down the line just like we\u2019re not counting reserves and rates from refracting horizontal wells, I really believe that in time the industry will figure that out, that technology exists and we\u2019ll get the benefit of that as well. ", "So you\u2019re right Rehan, that\u2019s a nice technology that we\u2019re looking at in order to be more efficient with water use and there is literally three or four other things as well that we\u2019re doing as well as the industry.", "Rehan Rashid - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &Co.,", "", "Okay. On the Barnett take away capacity, 1 to 1.3 Bcf roughly around end of the year, how about beyond that? Is there more on the table to come from what I understood there might be a couple of more Bcfs that are being proposed; any thoughts on that front please.", "Jeff Ventura", "There\u2019s other projects that are in the works and are being talked about to continue to expand and take away capacity out of the Barnett. The Barnett\u2019s being a great field. I think it\u2019s the biggest on shore gas field now in the U.S. and a very economy place to drill, very robust economics and production growth, so the pipeline companies are continuing to work with the producers in getting additional take away capacity out of the base.", "Rehan Rashid - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &Co., ", "", "One last top down question; when you are trying to plan all across the board and everybody else is working on all different kind of shale plays as well. How are you thinking to your other infrastructure needs, tubular goods, frac capacity; how are you kind of -- I\u2019m not generically speaking of planning for it but maybe some time lines in terms of how far ahead you need to plan for tubular goods, frac and anything else that comes to mind.", "Jeff Ventura", "Well, for instance all of our teams and areas, we take all of our properties and we forecast them out through the life of the properties. So we have plans that look at not just development of our existing proved reserves but the probable and possible and the merging plays beyond that and then we work with our pipeline guys and commercial guys like up in the appellation base and not only plans for lying the infrastructure to it, but make sure we have firm take away capacity for the volumes of gas that we expect to produce up there. ", "Same on the drilling side. We know for 2008 or end of this year obviously all the way through 2009 and we\u2019re already looking at 2010 in terms of the number rigs and types of rigs. We talked about in our release two special built for purpose rigs that we were in for the Marcellus Shale play up there, so the guys do a good job forward planning. ", "The proof is in the track record, but that we didn\u2019t get the 22 consecutive quarters or five years of meeting or beating our marks with out forward thinking in terms of what we\u2019re trying to do, but we realize with some of the bigger projects like the Marcellus Shale and some of the growth we have in the Barnett and other areas that we need to do a lot of that kind of planning and we do, do that.", "", "John Pinkerton", "Yes, I think one thing Rehan, this is John. We\u2019ve met with every single large take away capacity pipeline in the Appalachian Basin in terms because they all want to understand what in Marcellus plays all about, the potential and we obviously since we\u2019re related we have more information and have a better perspective than anybody else and the most encouraging thing is that essentially all of these big pipeline companies and you tell these want to be in the Marcellus Shale play in terms of providing take away capacity and a number of companies, dominion and all the others, several others have announced new projects and what not and we\u2019re right in the middle of all that. So, there is no better place on the plant earth to sell natural gas than the Marcellus Shale plays. ", "So, in terms the location I think 60% of the United States lives within 300 or 400 miles at the center of the play. So it\u2019s a marvelous place to have gas and to be selling gas over a long period of time, and that there is no doubt in my mind, that just what I\u2019ve seeing so far and the encouragement that I\u2019ve seeing from the other pipeline companies, it\u2019s just a matter of time and I don\u2019t think its going to take that long. I mean, the infrastructure we\u2019re putting in place that should be up and running in the first quarters is really going to allow us to ramp up dramatically and you can just from some of the take away capacities we\u2019re tying up, we absolutely are pretty confident in terms of the commerciality of the play. ", "So, again I think you guys step back a little bit and just think about it. We\u2019ve got 850,000 acres that we think we high graded. So it\u2019s huge for us and so therefore we\u2019re planning to add more than I think we\u2019ve ever had in terms of looking at some of that stuff. I am very encouraged in terms of where we\u2019ll be one, two or three years from now. I think its going to be for those shareholders that were kind of with us in the beginning they\u2019re going to see this through. It\u2019s really going to payoff, I think it\u2019s just a little patience here and its going to -- what we\u2019re seeing today is that all of a sudden the market will realize it and I think it\u2019ll be reflected in our stock price.", "Operator", "Thank you.

In some cases it will talk about reserves and rates, well cost, so we are going to try to put that out on the website. ", "David told me it will be up tomorrow. I\u2019m giving him an extra day, so say the weekend, so by Monday it will up there. When we are out and about it in our other conferences it will become part of our pitch book.

So a small percentage and the acreage we are assuming are in the thick part of the play in Tarrant and Tallian and areas like, but we are in and amongst -- it\u2019s why Devon is drilled like that, why EOG is drilled like that, so this year we\u2019ll be drilling our first 250 foot well like in Carter Industrial Park. Other people in the industry have drilled in those areas and are proving that it works.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company ", "Okay and then you mentioned that the Chesapeake wells, as I recall those were in Ellis County; did that do anything in terms of your standpoint in terms of validating some acreage that you thought may have been potentially more French as that moves further west from where some of your early activities were. ", "Jeff Ventura", "Absolutely. I mean if you look at our wells at this point, the distance between our too farthest horizontal wells is a little over 40 miles, which is huge in our oil and gas terms and we\u2019ve got quality wells in those areas. ", "When you factor in the Chesapeake wells which were in the West Virginia Panhandle, farther west of where we are, thinner and oilier if you want to say it that way, that\u2019s quite the right words, less mature maybe is a better way to say. Yes having those wells out there is great news for us, and then also factoring in all the Appalas wells even though Appalas -- and I haven\u2019t seen the latest presentation, but talking the Rich Webber and seeing their presentations in April they got over vertical wells that look really good. ", "We are not just looking at all wells in the play. When you factor in our 100 wells and Appalas is now probably 70 wells and Chesapeake\u2019s new wells including the poor wells that were drilled by, I think they threw out some of the companies, so I won\u2019t but some of the poor wells that we\u2019re drilled in other parts of the play and outside of those areas I think we have a really strong geologic model that works and makes sense, that\u2019s why I\u2019m excited about the play and confident. ", "At some point hopefully next March, plus or minus when the acreage is tied up, we\u2019ll have an analyst day and we\u2019ll really walk through our geologic model and it\u2019s really interesting in terms of why did we target what we target, how do we targeted, how do we drill in complete, why we do that and why do we pick certain areas, but yes jumping back to your question though, those Chesapeake wells are really good news. I\u2019m glad for Chesapeake. ", "I know Steve Dixon and the guys out there -- Steve usually listens to our call, so hello Steve if you are dialing in now; I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be on tomorrow and the great guys; I\u2019m happy for them, but I am glad for us because it\u2019s good news and for those that haven\u2019t heard they announced two wells at 9 million per day. So, 4.5 million per day wells in the thinner west matured areas is good news.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company ", "Right, and then Roger, because you\u2019ve been left out a little bit here, can you walkthrough the liquidity situation you talked about. I think you said you had 800 million available and then the next breadth 1.3 billion of liquidity; can you walkthrough that balance sheet again?", "Roger Manny", "Sure, thank you Ron, let me clarify that. We have what\u2019s known as an accordion facility with the bank group and what it enables us to do is we have a legally binding commitment of $1 billion under the commitment. They have under written our asset base and are willing to land up to a $1.5 billion in the borrowing base if we need it, but we don\u2019t want to pay for that extra 500 million and they don\u2019t want to have to book it as commitment and improve capital on it. ", "So, really if you want to go from $1 billion to a $1.5 billion we tender a notice with the agent and they survey the banks and they have 20 days to basically reallocate the exposure amongst themselves and comeback to us with it. It\u2019s a not a committed over line, but it\u2019s the closest thing you can get to it without paying for it. So, my numbers there, we have 800 million left on the committed liability of $1 billion and if you have 800 to the extra 500, you get the $1.3 billion I mentioned.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company ", "Okay, great and then just on your cost guidance, I missed what your expectations were from of our G&A level and the numbers you give me, should we assume that excludes the non-cash compensation and also on the production cost, it sounded like you expected your LOEs to stay around the $1 to $1.05 Range all in including work overs and we do the curtailing.", "Roger Manny", "I think we\u2019ll do a little better in that Ron. Work overs are just notorious and difficult to predict and the $0.10 we had this quarter was among the highest quarters we\u2019ve had in my memory. I think we\u2019ll be in the high $0.90 range when we take those non-recurring ones. As for G&A, the cash number, cash G&A for the last quarter was $0.49. I think that\u2019s going to hold where it is until we get some more production on; high $0.40 range is a good number.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company ", "Okay and then production taxes really know -- any shift in your production breakdown geographically? Should we anticipate any changes in that?", "Roger Manny", "No, we continue to file and get abatements in the Barnett for production tax plus production tax as you know Ron is based on well price not hedge price so that makes a difference, but now just a percent of production however we modeled it should continue to work fine.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Carver with Capital Ones. Please proceed with your question.", "Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast", "Yes a couple of questions. First of all, the number of wells per rig, per year in the Marcellus with the ramp up, I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for how many horizontals you\u2019ll probably be drilling in 2009?", "Jeff Ventura ", "We\u2019ve talked about going to eight rigs and wells it\u2019s really early. Typically, what we do just for the people who aren\u2019t familiar with this, usually in August, I usually ask the divisions on a wish list given the finding cost and rate of return criteria that they need to meet and LOE cost, what would they like to do for next year and we go through it and enter into a process. ", "So, it\u2019s really early to talk about that, but then to try to answer your question in a rough range and I\u2019m going to put a pretty wide band around it, you\u2019re probably looked at 80 to 100 wells or something like that and again eight rigs, we\u2019re saying, we\u2019re going to ramp up through the year and in next year to buy the eight rigs. It\u2019s not eight rigs on day one or eight rigs at a certain time, so you\u2019ve got to sort of filter them in across the year, but it\u2019s preliminary it\u2019s early, we got to run it by the board in December and we\u2019ll put it out next year.", "Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. So and 2009 guidance for the whole company would probably coming out sometime this fall?", "Jeff Ventura ", "That\u2019s fair Marshall.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Aydin with Keybanc Capital Markets. Proceed with your question.", "Jack Aydin - Keybanc Capital Markets ", "Roger, the tax rate for the second quarter, the corporate tax rate was about 40%. First of all why was it higher than it used to be and going forward what kind of tax rate you\u2019re thinking off?", "Roger Manny", "Yes, thank you Jack. Tax rate should be at the 38% going forward. We had a blip in the first quarter and year-to-date numbers from some deferred tax accounts that needed to be reallocated but it will be 38% going forward.", "Jack Aydin - Keybanc Capital Markets ", "As it relates to the amortization of leases that will expire, Jeff could you give us a hint where those leases are and at what timetable, how long those leases are and what percentage of your acreage, it lends itself to those type of expiration? ", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Rob dug into that a lot and Roger has that so let me turn that question over to Roger and I may comment at the end?", "Roger Manny", "Yes, good question Jack, because this is something that\u2019s a little new and let me answer it by first kind of putting it in perspective. Our total unproved property balance into the quarter is $422 million, that\u2019s 8.6% of our total assets. So when you look at in perspective, our unproved is way smaller than our peer group especially those with similar shale emerging play upside. ", "My point is we watch unproved properties very, very closely. We treat it as all of our assets, we manage it very efficiently and it\u2019s our interpretation of the accounting rules and it\u2019s shared by our auditors that even though you account for your unproved on a pool basis, that anytime you have a lease that expires that you have a carrying value associated with it, you must take an impairment of that lease that expired and what you\u2019re seeing in our numbers. ", "I\u2019m not sure quite frankly why you\u2019re not seeing them in our peer group numbers, is that when you enter a play such as the Barnett, when we repurchased strout, we booked a fair amount of acreage value on the transaction two years ago and of course as in any acreage purchase it\u2019s not all going to be good all the time, but when you make your purchase price allocation and this is going on across the industry Jack as you know. A lot of purchase price is being allocated to unproved acreage. When that acreage expires you\u2019ve got a pretty big number that\u2019s rolled in through the DD&A. ", "To directly answer your question some of the strout acreage that\u2019s coming up on the two year mark that was already a year or so old when we bought the company or in areas that we don\u2019t choose to pursue any longer and we\u2019re allowing to expire, but it went on the books at 10,000 an acre. So it doesn\u2019t take much acreage to create the write-down. ", "Conversely in areas where you\u2019ve got acreage down the street that\u2019s a 200 acre or less and that\u2019s a very small adjustment. So even thought you look at it on a pool basis, you can't look at the pool and say well my acreage value went up, so I\u2019m going to mark it up to offset the expirations, you can\u2019t do that. So, to answer your questions its mainly acreage that was acquired in various transactions and right now most of it seems to be in the Barnett and looking forward the guidance I gave you, the 5 million to 8 million per quarter should be sufficient to cover those expirations. ", "Jack Aydin - Keybanc Capital Markets", "You mean you\u2019re telling me with all the interest in Barnett and everything you could not get somebody to drill wells on this acreage or you don\u2019t care to drill wells on this as a \u2013 with your own volume, somebody else\u2019s volume?", "Jeff Ventura ", "Jack when you look at our old maps it shows the Barnett acreage. The good news is 95% of what was in the expanding core and of course we are going to putout very specific maps so you can see the areas we are talking about now, but when we say 95% of it was in the expanding core that means 5% of its not. ", "So, the stuffs that\u2019s all down in Boskie County, there\u2019s a tiny, tiny bit in Hamilton County, a little bit way out West. Our strategy is simple; we want to grow production, double digit or better this year, 19% or we want it all in cost structure being a tough curtail or better, we are not going to drill core wells in some of the more fringe areas or even renew those leases, we would rather focus our areas in the highest rates of return, best F&D, more certain areas than we would extend or drill some of the more marginal or fringe stuff, that\u2019s really what it is.", "Jack Aydin - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay thank you. John did you give the production number or guidance for the third quarter?", "John Pinkerton", "Yes, we think -- let me just go back over that Jack. We actually gave for the third and the fourth quarter. Third quarter were 384 million to 386 million and fourth quarter 395 million to 400 million.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Tom Gardner with Simmons & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Thomas Gardner - Simmons & Company", "I wanted to get some additional clarity on your Marcellus reserve expectations specifically what percentage or what fraction of your high graded acreage would you apply this to 3 to 4 Bcf range?", "Jeff Ventura ", "All of it.", "Thomas Gardner - Simmons & Company", "Do you see any reason to differentiate between your Northeast area or your Southwest area? ", "Jeff Ventura ", "Yes -- oh in terms of recovery per well?", "Thomas Gardner - Simmons & Company", "Yes.", "", "Jeff Ventura ", "No. Those are our other distinguishing things and obviously we have chosen to start a big development in the Southwest for a number of reason, but we think we\u2019ve drilled some very good wells in the Northeast as well and again where we will in time become more and more transparent as the different models and all the inveteracy\u2019s, but because of competitiveness and leasing we\u2019re going to going to withhold some of that, but in terms of the reserves per well we\u2019ll go with the 3 to 4 Bcfe. ", "In terms of costs per well depending in the Southwest, its shallower typically and you\u2019re out of the spine of the mountain. So, wells will tend to be cheaper down there. Those are going to be, I think towards the low end of the range there. If you\u2019re up into the mountains and areas to the Northeast particularly, some of those areas, the Marcellus can be 8000 or 8500 feet deep. So, those would be -- I would distinguish the cost, but I would not distinguish the reserves. That made sense?", "Thomas Gardner - Simmons & Company", "Yeah, it really does, I appreciate that.", "John Pinkerton", "The other thing if I could -- Tom if I can just butt in and make a point. The one thing in the Shale plays is really, really important in terms the cost side of the business is really important and the interesting thing -- I\u2019ll give you an example in the Barnett and try to relate it back to the Marcellus. ", "Down in Hood County, we own 67,000 acres in the Barnett and we drilled some really good wells and Jeff mentioned in this call now that\u2019s we\u2019ve really gotten the cost down and those wells when we first started drilling them we used to beak in 5900 horse power or topped rigs and the costs were $4 million per well. ", "David and our drilling team really learned a lot. We\u2019ve drilled 15 to 20 wells by now, we picked up more acreage and the three wells we drilled, we drilled three wells in 30 days that costs $1.6 million of drill. So, we drilled three wells for the cost of what one well costed in the very beginning and that same thing overtime is going to happen in the Marcellus and the onetime that, one really competitive advantage that we\u2019ve got because we own so much acreage in the beginning and we bought so much acreage for $100 and $200 an acre before the play went well. ", "We\u2019ve got some huge blocks of acres and now I\u2019m convinced overtime the same thing is going to happen on our big blocks in the Marcellus as what we\u2019re doing in the Barnett and where we can go in and start drilling five or six wells from a pad side and get the purpose rigs. We\u2019ve got a really first class drilling team up in the Marcellus, head up by John who\u2019s got 30 plus years of experience maybe 40. So, I\u2019m convinced overtime that $3 million that Jeff used, we\u2019ll beat that overtime.", "Jeff Ventura ", "To make it even more direct, John talked about those Hood County wells, they\u2019re 6500 feet deep that\u2019s what Marcellus is on the Southwest and a lot of the step we\u2019re drilling they\u2019re 3000, 3500 foot laterals similar to down in the Marcellus and number of stages. There\u2019s a lot of similarities granted the surface is rougher and granted you don\u2019t have the infrastructure in the Appalachian basin, but I agree with John\u2019s assessment that in time well I think we\u2019ll actually beat those numbers.", "John Pinkerton", "I\u2019ll now argue that the infrastructure in Appalachian is actually -- the large pipeline infrastructure, the take away lines are actually better in Appalachian, but you don\u2019t have other gathering systems. The gathering systems are relatively cheap, so the good news is I think in the Marcellus once these gathering systems -- and we\u2019ve got a number of them working and just not one, but as we develop the systems there is a lot more take away capacity and the good thing about the Marcellus, it\u2019s on the front end of all the Shale play. ", "So, Marcellus gas is going to demand a premium over Hainslow gas or Barnett gas or any Woodford gas. If any of this other gas, the Marcellus gas is going to get the highest price because it\u2019s closest to the end-user and it\u2019s got -- I think within a rough analysis, I think six of the eight largest pipeline systems in the U.S. run through our Marcellus acreage block. So, it\u2019s just a matter in the gathering systems build. Now is that easy to do, no because it\u2019s got shales, but we\u2019ve been operating up there for years. ", "We\u2019ve got ends of miles of gathering systems, we\u2019ve got this deal with MarkWest, we\u2019re taking about deals with other midstream. So, it\u2019s just a matter of time. I convinced it\u2019s going to work and the good news is in a quarter or two, we\u2019ll quit talking about it and all we\u2019ll about is we\u2019re 30 million a day, we\u2019re blank, blank and blank and where we project it and everybody will forget about all this over the infrastructure. ", "I will continue to focus and tell you guys that the infrastructure it\u2019s just a matter of time, it\u2019s coming; there is a lot of people chasing the infrastructure out there with a lot of money. It\u2019s going to in time, it will get better.", "Jeff Ventura ", "Yes, and I agree with that. Marcellus doesn\u2019t have the same infrastructure, I was talking about just like the Barnett Shale if you go back in your early years talking about Mark Whitley and the original natural gas, when a lot of other operation really ramped up and we had a lot of more drilling companies, a lot of more pumping companies and all those types of things, but all those companies, we already talked to, they all want to be there. A lot of our moment equipment up there, so I agree with John that will happen.", "Thomas Gardner - Simmons & Company", "Well, then the question is, how fast can you go. I mean you\u2019re planning eight rigs for 2009, can you walk us through the possible upsides there, the activity in 2009 and beyond?", "Jeff Ventura ", "Yes, I think I would just draw -- you can draw the analogies and an easy analogies maybe is back to the builder or some of the other plays. I think we\u2019ll be able to ramp up significantly. In 2000 we talked about 2009 being at 8 rigs plus or minus, we\u2019re working on that. Now, we\u2019ll have a significant ramp up in 2010 and \u201811 and beyond and as you know as it\u2019s conceivable we could get to 20, 30 or 40 rigs. At some point in the future with continued development and continued good acreage, I think the answer is yes but obviously its early say that and we need to continue to drill wells. We\u2019ll be planning, we\u2019re looking at optimizing, we\u2019re in the process of choosing. ", "If you go back in 2004 when we started it was an idea; could the Marcellus Shale be significant shale play and we were the industry leader in that, we came up with the idea, we pioneered it, we tried it. Now we\u2019re moving from \u201cyeah it does work; we\u2019ve drilled a number of excellent wells.\u201d I mean talking about the last seven wells here at 4.9 million per day those will be excellent wells in Tarrant County, those will be good wells in Johnson County and that will be phenomenal wells. ", "Now we are going from does the idea work to can we return it into a development project, which is what we are currently doing and then it comes back to ramping up and optimizing NPV, but we all understand we want there to be a good storage in the shareholder money, we are all heavily invested in the company and clearly we want to maximize that value for our shareholders and our selves.", "Thomas Gardner - Simmons & Company", "One last question and then I\u2019ll hop off here. On the Huron Shale just an idea of what your reserve expectations and well cost are going forward and what is the greatest risk for this to become a successful resource play?", "Jeff Ventura ", "Well, I think the easiest thing to look at there is all the work that equitable did right across the border in Kentucky plus we now have three wells on our own property. It looks like based on the equitable stuff they released I think they\u2019re talking about reserves, of 0.8 to 1.5 base per well for from a possible 1 million to 1.6 million per well or something like that. ", "Based on our early work in Nora those numbers seem to hold out. I\u2019m absolutely confident with the shale, because you got over a 100 control points with existing vertical wells and that\u2019s why we are convinced to know that its full of gas and I know that now that horizontal drilling works at least in three spots. So we\u2019ll be basically, equally distributing those wells across the bulk of the acreage and by the end of the year if it works and that to us will be risk about a Bcf and half and that\u2019s basically using roughly a 100 acreage spacing and a Bcf per well, which is inline with the equitable thing that we were seeing really on. ", "The other thing I talked about is and I just mentioned it; that is the potential for the horizontal Bureau there. Bureau is really one of the original formations that was developed from that 1950s and beyond in the vertical Bureau wells were good, but again equitable in the area, in the vicinity has tried horizontal Bureau well and last I heard and they obviously would have more up to date information; they had two wells and per well each of those wells averaged over 2 million per day per well for the first 30 days. ", "We have a big Bureau fair way on our Nora block that\u2019s an excellent candidate for horizontal drilling and there is a chance we may take a couple of those 10 wells and just drill maybe perhaps eight wells and convert a couple of those to horizontal Bureau. That\u2019s a tremendous target too. They could in addition add several 100 Bcf net to range as well as equitable.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Pattarozzi with Tudor Pickering. Please proceed with your question.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor Pickering", "Actually you\u2019ve got David Heikkinen and thanks for the long call. I think I\u2019ll get to the question. John and Jeff you\u2019ve talked about efficiency in the Barnett and Steven focused on rig count. I think something I just wonder about is as you thinking about Marcellus, thinking about efficiency and base the drill with your current rigs, kind of the purpose of the rigs, any of the characteristics of that and thinking about more of a wells count on an efficiencies basis as you improve; what has your ideal well been. If you did everything right on the 25 horizontal wells that you\u2019ve drilled can you give us any of that information?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes today if we did everything right we took the trouble of being literally like 3.3 million per well for our wells in Southeast Pennsylvania horizontal, so that\u2019s assuming no additional productivity gains, no built for purpose rigs, no pad drilling, no optimization of bids from HUD system or anything like that. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve said it for a while now and I feel confident we\u2019ll get in that $3 million per well drilling complete range and actually like John said I believe we\u2019ll got an A plus team out there. I believe in time they\u2019ll be it, whether some wells are 50 or a 100 or whatever well it is, but if we\u2019ve got several thousand wells to drill I grantee you those guys will do good a job driving that down because we know there\u2019s other things we can do to get better than that. That\u2019s just eliminating the trouble and taking the time out of our existing wells, guess is to that 3.3 million today.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor Pickering", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful, and then just on the Bureau you\u2019ve talked about a fair way, you also then talked about testing the Huron, going up in the Pennsylvania and Brine Street and the other -- how much capital do you invest in testing kind of the new ventures in the back half of the year?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "The Bureau is pretty interesting and pretty easy because we have several 100 vertical wells that are already built through it, literally about 600 of them. So we know in the Nora block exactly where the burrier is and what the thicknesses are and rock properties and all that kind of stuff, and it\u2019s a great vertical target. I just believe it will be even a better horizontal target, so we\u2019ll probably take two of the ten Huron wells that we have scheduled down there, horizontal Huron wells and convert them burrier wells, so it won\u2019t be any incremental capital, we\u2019ll just reallocate some capital. ", "In terms of the Utica, we\u2019ve actually been studying the Utica for a long time regarding to the Marcellus in 2004, and several good other flinch things have popped out of it. One we\u2019ve recognized the Utica potential, so we\u2019ve been looking about that and talking about it and now it\u2019s just up in our offices about three weeks ago and so a pretty complete study on the Utica. So I would imagine sometime next year we\u2019ll probably drill our first Utica well. ", "The other thing to remember as we\u2019ve got such a big footprint up there 2.6 million gross acres, we already have the acreage. So there is no incremental acreage cost, it\u2019s just going out and trying it, so next year when we haven\u2019t put our budget together; like I said we typically do that in the fall, but we\u2019ll probably have one or two Utica wells in therefore next year. ", "The other thing, the other shale\u2019s that (Inaudible) our all Devonian eight shale\u2019s that are above the Marcellus. So as we\u2019ve drilled our roughly hundred vertical and horizontal Marcellus shale well, we\u2019ve drilled right through those three intervals. So, when we run our ECS logs, we already have ECS logs across those intervals. We\u2019ve already gotten the core data and across some of those interval and we think there is some really good opportunity out there, some of our existing acreage. ", "We haven\u2019t put out or quantified it yet or released any of that information, but next year, you can be assured we\u2019ll be testing some of that as well and probably between now and end of the year, we\u2019ll quantify the upside of all those various horizons and as the appropriate whether we do it at the end of this year or really next year, when we update our pyramid and emerging place we\u2019ll have those other horizons in there.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor Pickering", "And then just a final question, acreage in the Ardmore Basin now, did you add acreage there or what's you total?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "We have about 16,000 net acres in the Ardmore Basin. Its over 100,000 acres gross, so we actually we have a pretty good big footprint. In some areas we actually operate and control, the other areas that we don\u2019t are either operated by XTO or Chesapeake and both of those companies are drilling on their acreage and we\u2019re drilling where we operate. ", "Its early on, there\u2019s something encouraging things coming out that and the big thing to remember of the Ardmore Basin, Woodford versus Oklahoma this is the wells are significantly cheaper. It\u2019s easier drilling for a number of reasons. So, the well cost are about half and we\u2019ve gotten some interest and its early, but we have some interesting results so far, probably need another quarter or two of testing before we put a lot of information out, but we\u2019ll know lot more by the end of the year, but I\u2019m something encouraging and that could be 400 days or so in that range, so far so good.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Leo Mariani with RBC. Please proceed with your question. ", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets ", "Just a follow-up on the Marcellus here. I guess at the point you guys have 22 wells that you\u2019ve tested horizontally; are any of those on production at this point of time or are they waiting for the higher pressure gathering to come into the first quarter of \u201909.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Some of those are in production and some of them have been in production for basically, approximately a year. So, we have a year\u2019s work of history. That\u2019s the other thing, when you talk about shales and other shale plays in generally. The good news again we\u2019ve got 100 total wells, 22 horizontal and all those veridical wells that have been on since the end of 2004 and our oldest horizontal for about a year. ", "So we are gathering reasonable production data. You\u2019re right though we have a number of wells we\u2019ve drilled, that we have drilled and tested in some cases we are testing them up to 30 days. So we\u2019ve got good long-term test on them not for a day or two, but for 30 days and when we get our facilities and equipment in place those will come online and we are telling you that\u2019s the first quarter next year. ", "So not only that we have $22.5 million of Barnett production that will come online by the end of the year, we\u2019ve got a significant amount of Marcellus production that we feel will come online and that\u2019s why we are coming out with -- we\u2019ll be at 30 million a day by the first quarter of next year.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets ", "So those couple of horizontal wells that are online in Marcellus, are those been curtailed at this point or were there some areas we had the gathering that could handle that kind of volume. ", "Jeffrey Ventura", "No, we have some gathering and it\u2019s not just a couple there is several of them. So, we have good long-term tests on a number of wells that are un-curtailed, so we have a good feel for how they actually produced.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets ", "Okay, and in terms of just kind of taking a look at 2009 you talked about, just 30 million a day in the first quarter and I mean is it reasonable to assume you guys talked about 130 million a day of firm take away that you\u2019re going to able to step that up sequentially each quarters as we go forward, or are you guys are working on gathering projects to get out there and hook up more well each quarter successfully there?", "Jeff Ventura ", "Yes, Let me clarify I said a 130 by mistake, it\u2019s a 150 million a day that\u2019s what\u2019s in the release and that\u2019s what we currently have secured, but we\u2019re well in the process of doing more than that, but yeah we\u2019ll continue to look that ramping up and optimizing in that positive shale.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019re nearing the end of today\u2019s conference. We will go to Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets for our final question. Please proceed.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets", "Certainly a lot more gas will be coming out of the Appalachian Basin in years 2009 and beyond. Could you comment on and what you think happens to the premium placed on that gas today, and I guess I asked that in the phase of maybe, sluggish to down or flat demand growth in the Northeast markets?", "John Pinkerton", "Well a couples of things. I think production will -- I think it\u2019ll be primarily, that\u2019s quite frankly will be up, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be, it\u2019s going to flow through the market. I think as we\u2019ve said it will ramp up overtime and we are the leader in the play and so I think everybody else will be a bit behind us, in total way, but I think gas will come on overtime and I think there is a number, that when you look at the landscape in terms of the Northeast, there is a number. It\u2019s not an easy equation, but I think, there is a lot of things that may have actually given me very much a boom in terms of natural gas one, it\u2019s trading roughly 50% of what the crude oil was trading before, so I think there will be upward pressure on natural gas in terms of just being a commodity versus. ", "For oil there is a lot of a ledger generations that\u2019s got to be built in the Northeast very quickly over the next five to 10 years. I think natural gas, that won\u2019t be nuclear. I think a lot of coal is being challenged due to the carbon footprint; even clean coal which I think is a miss number can\u2019t compete with natural gas. I think the whole processes are up substantially. ", "So I think natural gas is going to be clearly the victory in Northeast. I think that\u2019ll be in the other parts of the U.S. too. So, I\u2019m not too concerned quite frankly and the good news is that we heard our Marcellus play is going to be about 50 or better in terms of finding cost, so I don\u2019t worry about gas whether it\u2019s $7, $8, $10 or $12, I think we\u2019ll be highly successful, I think we\u2019ll be very economic. ", "When you step back, when we look at natural gas, it is the only thing that I see, and I\u2019m trying to be objective here but obviously it\u2019s all because it\u2019s natural gas. When I look at all the different sources of the MGI because it\u2019s going to drive all this, to me in the short-term and I mean short-term zero to 10 years, natural gas is the only one that in a material way that can cover that, unless we want to continue importing coal and oil, which I think, if we don\u2019t do it in time, it will 200 barrels or if you want to continue to pollute the environment with some of the other dirty refines. ", "So, I think at the end of the day, its all going to comeback to natural gas and the good news is while these big electric generation facilities are going to need firm long-term commitments and we\u2019ve already been talking to a number of them that\u2019s come to us wanting to firm that up. So, I\u2019m actually seeing it real time in terms of some of the enquiries from of some of the big power generators up in the Northeast. So, I think we will it be adapted if a hurricane doesn\u2019t come or the weather is a little different and all that kind of stuff and I think those are short-term events, but when I look over the next one, two, three, four, five year for natural gas, I\u2019m very bullish and I think where our gas is and where the Marcellus play even makes me more bullish in term of that.", "Jeff Ventura ", "Well, I like to just add one thing. John mentioned the economics and referred to the economics in the Marcellus. The stuff I talked about earlier, David Heikkinen\u2019s going to have a graph out on our website either tomorrow or Monday and of course we use different analyst stuff, but Shannon Nome with Deutsche Bank just completed a study of all the Shale plays across the U.S. including the Marcellus and the Hindville and Woodford and Barnett, core and non-core and that will be up on our website and I think it\u2019s a good piece of work and I would encourage you to look at that as well.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Pinkerton for his concluding remarks.", "John Pinkerton", "Well, I want to thank everybody for staying on. I know we\u2019ve run over, but I think there were a number of questions that we needed to answer that you all wanted us to answer. So, hopefully we\u2019re able to answer a lot of those questions. I think as I talked to our shareholders, the things they tend to want to know are these things that we kind of -- the hard things you get your arms around which is some of the water issues in the Marcellus and some of the permanent things and I just want to make sure that we are on top of that, we know what we\u2019re doing and we\u2019ve got the right people doing the right things. ", "We wouldn\u2019t commit eight rigs, we wouldn\u2019t be committing the 150 million of that capacity, it\u2019s probably more than double by year end if we weren\u2019t confident that these things were going to resolve themselves overtime. We obviously know a lot that we\u2019re not disclosing for competitive reasons, but we\u2019re very confident in terms of the information we\u2019re given you, in terms of the ramp up of the Marcellus, the project, the progress we\u2019re making in terms of our infrastructure. ", "I think those of you all who have been in the Range stock for a time in \u201904 and \u201905 I think if there is any I can give you advice on is that we are just around the corner here. I think everybody is going to be pleasantly surprised with some of the stuff, especially as Jeff said when we come out with some of the more of the technical data. We rode this point for a while. I suggest you stay on our backs and we\u2019ll get you to the finish line I promise you that. ", "With that again we appreciate you staying on, if there is any question you didn\u2019t get to, feel free to call. Roger, I, Jeff, David or the others at Range will be happy to answer.

This call is being recorded.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.  Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.  Such statements are subject to risk and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.", "After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question and answer period.  At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources.", "Rodney L. Waller ", "Range Resources reported results for the fourth quarter and 2008 year with record production, revenues, cash flow and earnings both in absolute dollar amounts and on a per share basis.  2008 marks our sixth consecutive year of sequential production growth with 24 consecutive quarters of sequential production growth.  Drill bit finding cost for the year came in at $1.70 per MCFE and drill bill reserve replacement was 367% of our 2008 production.  ", "We have posted on our website supplemental tables to assist you in understanding many of the numbers in the press release.  In the press release we\u2019ve furnished some non-GAAP reconciliations which allow you to compare our results to our historically reported numbers which include the Gulf of Mexico operations that we sold during 2007.  In table five of the supplemental tables we\u2019ve presented a summary of the non-GAAP numbers which correspond to the analyst models taking out certain non-cash items.", "On the call today with me are John Pinkerton, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Ventura, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Before turning the call over to John I\u2019d like to cover a few administrative items.", "First, we did file our 10K with the SEC this morning.  It is available on the home page of our website or you can access it using the SEC EDGAR system.  In addition, we have posted on our website supplemental tables which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of our non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today.  Tables are also posted on the website that will give you detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter.  ", "Second, we will be participating in several conferences in March and April.  Check our website for a complete listing.  We\u2019ll be at the Simmons\u2019 Energy Conference in Las Vegas on March 5th and 6th, the Raymond James Institutional Investor Conference in Orlando on March 9th and 10th, Howard Weil Conference in New Orleans on the 24th and 25th of March and the IPAA Oil & Gas Conference in New York on April 21st.", "Now, let me turn the call over to John.", "John H. Pinkerton ", "Before Roger reviews the financial results, I\u2019ll review some of the key accomplishments for 2008.  On a year-over-year basis, production rose 20% beating the high end of our guidance.  Fourth quarter production averaged 303 million a day, a record high representing the first time in Range\u2019s history that quarterly production exceeded 400 million a day.  It also represents the 24th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth.  I should note that no other company is our peer group has achieved that particular goal.  This is a vivid testimony to the quality in my opinion of our operating teams.  ", "At yearend 2008 proved reserves totaled 2.7 TCF a 19% increase over 2007.  As Rodney mentioned reserve replacement from all sources was 405% including oil revisions.  Our drilling program alone delivered 367% reserve replacement at a cost of about $1.70 per MCFE.  Based on what we\u2019ve seen to date these look to be in the top 10% of our peer group.", "In addition to adding roughly half a TCF of crude reserves, we added 400,000 net acres to our leasehold inventory at an average cost of approximately $1,500 per acre.  Most of the acreage was added in our Marcellus shale play in Appalachia.  Next, at the end of the day we combined exceptional growth in production in reserves with low finding costs, that\u2019s the hard part in our business, combing high growth with low costs.  Again, this performance is attributable directly to the very talented technical teams that are with Range.", "In 2008 we completed $68 million of assets sales.  Over the last three years we\u2019ve sold $303 million of properties.  We believe periodically selling our more mature properties have several benefits.  First, it helps us focus on higher growth opportunities; second, it provides additional capital to spend on high return activities; third, it helps high grade our property base; and fourth, asset sales reduce the need to issue equity.  We plan to continue selling non-core properties from time-to-time.  Although not the best market we\u2019re considering selling a few properties in 2009.  We\u2019ll only pull the trigger if we see reasonable prices, if not we\u2019ll hold on to the properties and look to sell them later.", "When you look at 2008 I\u2019m really proud of what we didn\u2019t do.  In particular we didn\u2019t do a lot of high priced acquisitions that would have negatively affected our low cost structure for many years.  While we had plenty of opportunities to acquire properties in our core areas during 2008 our bidding strategy was focused on maintaining our low cost structure.  As a result, we were severely outbid on all these property potential acquisitions.  ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger to review our financial results.  ", "Roger S. Manny ", "Let me start by recapping full year 2008 financial performance before discussing the fourth quarter.  Some of the key financial highlights of \u201908 include one, achieving record high annual EBITDAX of $955 million and record high annual cash flow of $853 million.  These measures were both 27% higher than last year.  Two, ending the year with over 70% of our production hedged and securing additional hedges in early \u201909 bringing our hedged position up to approximately 81% of our anticipated \u201909 gas production and that\u2019s at a floor price of $7.62 an MMBtu.", "Third, we issued $250 million of 10 year senior subordinated notes last April at 7.25%.  We did that to refinance bank debt and we also sold $282 million of common stock to acquire promising Marcellus share acreage at very attractive prices.  Fourth, we increased our liquidity by raising our committed bank credit facility from $900 million to $1,250,000,000 in a challenging bank credit market.  ", "Cash margin for the year was $6.04 per MCFE or 7% higher than the $5.67 per MCFE figure from last year.  Net income from continuing operations for the year was $346 million, up 107% from last year\u2019s $167 million figure.  Net income calculated as analysts typically do which excludes asset sales gains, hedging mark-to-market gains and other non-cash items was $309 million or $1.98 per fully diluted share.  This compares favorably to the analyst consensus earnings per share estimate of $1.80 for 2008.", "Cash flow per fully diluted share in 2008 was $5.47, a 22% increase from 2007.  Now, this \u201908 cash flow per share result was $0.04 above the analyst consensus estimate of $5.43.  As always, we please view the Range earnings new release and visit the Range website for detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.  ", "Now, the details behind \u201908 were very similar to prior years with steady increases in production volume and to a lesser extent this year improving oil and gas prices outpacing increases in operating costs.  The average price received for our oil and gas sales this year including the hedges on those volumes increased by 7% from $8.03 a MCFE to $8.58 per MCFE.  ", "As John often reminds us and as he just mentioned, sometimes the best deals you do for the company are the ones that you do not do.  By relying on steady drill bit growth, refraining from high price proved reserve acquisitions and by financing our unproved acreage purchases with common equity and 10 year fixed rate notes, we were able to end 2008 as a larger company but with essentially the same quality balance sheet as we entered the year. ", "Our book debt to cap ratio was 42% at the end of the year.  That\u2019s compared to 40% at the beginning of \u201908.  We ended the year with over $500 million in committed unused credit capacity under the bank credit facility.  Also, we added four new banks to the credit facility in \u201908 further reducing our reliance upon any single bank.   The largest share of the credit facility held by any one bank has been reduced to just below 5%.  ", "Lastly, we pressure tested our $1.5 billion credit facility borrowing base by running our yearend proved reserves using the current agent bank \u201909 gas and oil price assumptions that start at $4.50 per MMBtu and $40 a barrel.  The results shows that our maximum conforming borrowing base capacity remains approximately $2.2 billion as our proved reserve additions in \u201908 have offset the impact of declining prices.  So, our $1.5 billion borrowing base has already been tested in the current commodity price environment and we feel like we\u2019re in great shape.  ", "Direct operating expenses excluding non-cash compensation expense on a unit cost basis were $0.99 per MCFE for the year up from $0.92 last year.  G&A expense excluding non-cash comp for the year was $0.49 per MCFE compared to $0.44 last year.  Interest expense for the year was $0.71 per MCFE compared to $0.67 in \u201907 and lastly, DD&A expense for the year was $2.12 per MCFE compared to last year\u2019s $1.89 figure.  ", "Our all in cash and non-cash total unit cost expense for \u201908 was 8% higher than \u201907.  While cost increases are never welcome, we\u2019re pleased with this performance considering record high 2008 oil and gas prices made for an intensely competitive year for oil and gas industry services.", "Turning to the fourth quarter of 2008 the good news in the fourth quarter was a 17% increase in production over last year and our second quarter in a row of declining direct operating unit costs.  The bad news was a 21% decrease in well head oil and gas prices from the fourth quarter of last year leading to a 17% decline in our oil and gas price received after hedging.  ", "Now, the result of fourth quarter prices falling faster than volumes increased was a 9% year-over-year decline in quarterly EBITDAX and a 13% decline in year-over-year quarterly cash flow.  EBITDAX for the fourth quarter \u201908 was $192 million and cash flow for the fourth quarter of \u201908 was $165  million.  Net income for the fourth quarter void by hedging derivative mark-to-market gains was $94 million, up 173% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter.  ", "Our earnings calculated as analysts typically do which eliminates these types of non-recurring and non-cash items was $52 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share.  That\u2019s down 19% from the fourth quarter of last year.  Cash flow for the fourth quarter per fully diluted share was $1.05 down 15% from last year.  These figures compare favorably to analyst consensus estimates of $0.22 for earnings and $1.03 for cash flow.", "Even though 2009 is expected to be a year of significantly lower oil and gas service costs Range began to see real improvement in our direct operating costs in mid 2008 and the fourth quarter of 2008 was a continuation of this positive trend.  Direct operating unit costs including work overs for the fourth quarter was $0.94.  Now, this compares to $1 in the third quarter of \u201908 and $1.05 in the second quarter of \u201908.  ", "In fact, even though production is increased 20% year-over-year actual direct operating expense for the fourth quarter of $35.7 million is the lowest since the first quarter of 2008.  The reduction in direct operating expense may be attributed to fewer work overs, lower water hauling and disposal costs and reductions in general well servicing costs.  My compliments to the Range Southwest Division which is leading the charge in this cost reduction effort.  It is anticipated that further reductions in direct operating unit costs are possible as we enter \u201909 with direct operating unit costs in the mid $0.90 range expected. ", "Working through the rest of the cost structure for the fourth quarter G&A unit costs excluding non-cash stock compensation expense was $0.53 per MCFE, that\u2019s down $0.01 from last quarter but up $0.07 from the fourth quarter of last year.  Essentially all of the G&A unit costs increase is attributable to our Marcellus shale expansion.  Some of the more significant G&A expense increases are from additional staff, employee relocation, office ramp and even supplies.  ", "Now, unlike growth through acquisitions, establishing a major new shale place in a province without the required local expertise is not only a costly proposition but the expense must be incurred prior to commencing large scale production.  I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to take some time to grow in to these G&A expenses associated with the build out at the Marcellus shale but as I\u2019ve said before, we\u2019ll gladly trade $0.10 of higher G&A unit cost for $1 or more in lower finding and development costs.  We expect G&A expense to remain in that $0.55 to $0.59 range in \u201909.  ", "Exploration expense including non-cash stock compensation came in well under guidance at $11.5 million for the quarter.  That\u2019s due to lower seismic and dry hole expenses.  Future 2009 quarters should see exploration expense in the $15 to $17 million range.  This is approximately one third lower than 2008 and that\u2019s due to our lower capital budget in \u201909.", "Appearing for the first time on the income statement on the line below exploration expense is a new expense line item labeled abandonment and impairment of unproved properties.  These expenses formerly were combined with DD&A expense and have now been reclassified to a specific line item to improve statement clarity.  Like most companies with significant acreage positions, Range\u2019s three plus million acre position represents a large asset in terms of both dollars and physical size so periodically undrilled acreage and areas we deem non-perspective is allowed to expire or acreage may become impaired due to poor drilling results, the economic environment or surface use and title issues.  ", "During the fourth quarter of \u201908 Range recorded a $36.6 million non-cash charge for acreage that was expiring or will expire in the near future that we do not intend to drill.  The bulk of this acreage was in the non-core portion of the Barnett shale and to a lesser extent full Trenton Black River and shallow tight gas sand Appalachian acreage.  Now, while this non-cash expense item will vary from quarter-to-quarter we anticipate that we will be expensing approximately $5 to $8 million per quarter in the future depending on our drilling plans.", "Now, the DD&A rate per MCFE for the fourth quarter of \u201908 was $2.18 compared to $2.11 in the fourth quarter of \u201907.  In the fourth quarter of each year that\u2019s when we reset our DD&A rate based upon the new yearend reserve report and based on this year\u2019s reset out DD&A rate per MCFE going forward in to \u201909 is expected to be $2.20.  This $2.20 figure includes $2.05 per MCFE for depletion and $0.15 per MCFE for depreciation and amortization of our other assets.", "The relatively small $0.15 increase in our core depletion rate following one of the most high cost years in our business is a very positive sign.  It\u2019s also a good sign that the depletion rate didn\u2019t decline due to our large write down of the carrying value of our proved reserves.  Besides having no impairment on our proved properties as we  have no goodwill on our books we also have no goodwill write offs.", "Interest expense for the fourth quarter of \u201908 was just over $27 million or $0.74 per MCFE.  This compares to $0.68 per MCFE last year.  The increase stems from the decision earlier in \u201908 to refinance short term floating rate bank debt with higher rate 10 year subordinated notes and also higher aggregate debt levels.  Interest expense per MCFE going forward should remain relatively constant.  ", "Those of you that pay attention to our income tax expense lines may notice that range paid $4.3 million in cash income taxes during \u201908.  Approximately one third of this amount was federal income taxes which we elected to pay in order to preserve some of our NOL carry forward slated to expire in 2012.  Our $159 million NOL carry forward is a valuable asset and by capitalizing some of our current year intangible drilling cost deductions for use in future years we\u2019re able to utilize some of the NOL before it expires. ", "Now, the remainder of the cash taxes paid were mostly Virginia state taxes incurred in our operations there.  Our Virginia operations are very low cost and also generate significant royalty income.  When combined with last year\u2019s high natural gas prices 2008 taxable income was generated there in excess of our deductions.  Our effective tax rate remains 37% and we expect cash taxes in \u201909 to be between $3 and $4 million of which about $500,000 will be at the federal level and the remainder at the state level. ", "We added additional 2009 hedges to our position such that we now have approximately 81% of our gas production hedged in 2009 at a floor price of $7.62  per MMBtu.  The bulk of the new hedges are for the second and third quarters of \u201909 which is where we saw the greatest potential for price weakness.  Specific price and volume hedging information may be found on the press release and also Range\u2019s website.", "In summary, we posted record revenue production and cash flow in \u201908 without burdening our balance sheet or compromising our low cost structure through ill timed high price acquisitions.  We also increased and strengthened our bank credit facility preserving our access to over $500 million in committed credit capacity.  We have a running start to lower direct operating expenses in \u201909 thanks to another consecutive quarter of declining direct operating costs.", "From a macroeconomic perspective while \u201909 is shaping up to be a challenging year, Range\u2019s position for a successful 2009 thanks to our low cost structure, strong hedge cash flow, attractive high rate of return projects in our core areas and over $500 million of available liquidity.  With that John, I\u2019ll turn the mic back to  you.", "John H. Pinkerton ", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff to review our operations and drilling results.  ", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "I\u2019ll begin by reviewing production.  For the fourth quarter production averaged 403 million per day, a 17% increase over the fourth quarter of 2007.  This represents the highest quarterly production rate in the company\u2019s history and its 24th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth.  ", "Let\u2019s now review our three key projects.  First, I\u2019ll start with the Marcellus shale in the Appalachian basin.  The first processing plant a refrigeration plant came online last October and the capacity of the plant is 30 million per day.  The second plant, a cryogenic plant is on schedule and is planned to come online in early April.  It will add an additional 30 million per day.  In total, we anticipate having 180 million per day of processing capacity by late this year or early next year.", "Range is on track to exit 2009 with Marcellus production at 80 to 100 million per day net.  We plan on accomplishing that with the three drilling rigs that we have now and exiting the year with six drilling rigs.  The fact that we believe we can reach 80 to 100 million per day net and only have to run so few rigs speaks to the excellent quality of the wells we\u2019re drilling and anticipate to drill this year.  ", "The IPs for the last 13 wells tied in to the plant average 6.9 million per day.  Our last well IP\u2019d for 10.3 million per day.  That\u2019s excellent for any shale play particularly when you consider that these wells will cost $3 to $4 million and the gas sells for a premium to NYMEX not a $1 to $2 deduct like some other areas.  ", "We believe that the Marcellus shale has excellent economics.  We currently are estimating reserves per well to average 3 to 4 BCFE in the areas that we\u2019re drilling and the cost to drill and complete in a development mode will be between $3 and $4 million per well.  Assuming the midpoint of both ranges, and $7 per MCF NYMEX gas price, the rate of return is 75% and the finding and development cost is $1.16.  At $5 per MCF NYMEX flat forever the rate of return is 46%.  Assuming the same reserves and costs NYMEX could drop to $3.25 per MCF and these wells would still have a 20% rate of return.  ", "Our acreage position in the Marcellus Fairway is nearly 900,000 net acres.  This acreage was acquired at an average cost of about $500 per acre.  The 900,000 acres equate to more than 15 to 22 TCFE of net unrisk resource potential.  Of that, 10 to 15 TCF are located in the southwest part of the play with the remainder in the northeast.  We just announced two vertical wells in the northeast that tested at 24 hour rates of 6.3 and 2.3 million per day.  The 6.3 million per day is the highest reported 24 hour IP rate from any vertical rate in the Marcellus play to date.  Range also holds the record for the highest rate horizontal well in the play too which is 24.5 million per day.", "In addition to pursuing the Marcellus shale, we\u2019re studying the Utica, Burkett, Middlesex, Genesee and Rinestreet shales.  There\u2019s good potential for all these horizons on our existing acreage in the Appalachian basin.  The perspective areas of these unexploited shales targets largely occur within Range\u2019s core Marcellus acreage positions thus allowing for stack pay opportunities and operational efficiencies in resource development.   Range owns a total of 2.7 million gross acres or 2.3 million net of leasehold in the Appalachian basin. ", "Another very impactful low risk project for us in the basin is our Nora area in Virginia.  There\u2019s significant upside to all three horizons in Nora, CBM, tight gas sands and the Huron shale.  Range continues to drill successful CMB and tight gas sand wells in this field and has over 2,150 producing wells here.  F&D costs net to Range continue to be around $1 per MCF which is among the lowest in the country.  In addition, these wells produce very little water and have low lifting cots.", "Given its location in the basin these wells also receive a premium to NYMEX.  This in combination with low F&D and low LOE results in a very good rate of return of about 60% at a $7 per MCF NYMEX gas price.  At $5 the rate of return is 33%.  Given the large number of wells which can be drilled in current spacing and assuming successful down spacing there are approximately 6,000 wells left to drill.", "The latest development in Nora is horizontal drilling in the Huron shale.  We know that the Huron shale has good thickness in gas content across our acreage because we already have 107 producing vertical Huron shale wells on it.  We began drilling horizontally to verify that horizontal drilling is an effective way to economically develop these reserves.  So far, we\u2019re seven for seven.  These seven wells averaged an initially peak 24 hour rate of 1.1 million per day to sales which is very good.   ", "We\u2019ve also drilled and completed two more which should be turned to sales soon.  This has the potential of about 1.5 TCF of net gas reserves to Range.  The next idea we\u2019ll be testing at Nora is horizontal development in the Berea sandstone which we believe has excellent potential on our acreage as well.  Our first well was successful and came on line at 1.5 million per day.  Our second horizontal Berea well has been drilled and completed and is currently being tested.  We should have a rate by the end of this week.", "The next project I want to discuss is the Barnett shale play in the Fort Worth basin.  Range currently has about 96,000 net acres in the Barnett shale play.  42,000 net acres are Tarrant, Johnson, Denton, Eastern Parker, Eastern Hood, Northwest Ellis and Southwest Dallas counties.  This is the core part of the play and we still have over 1,000 locations to drill in these areas.  That assumes 540 spacing which equates to about 40 acre spacing.  It also assumes 50% of the acreage is developed on 250 foot spacing. ", "This represents 1.6 TCF of net unrisk, unbooked upside in the core proven part of the Barnett.  Currently, we have five rigs running in the Barnett.  In this part of the Barnett our wells are averaging about 3 BCF and cost about $2.6 million.  At $7 NYMEX this generates close to a 70% rate of return.  At a $5 flat gas price forever, the rate of return is 32%.  ", "I want to take a few minutes now and discuss Range\u2019s portfolio of properties.  Range has a great portfolio of properties led by the three projects that I\u2019ve just described: the Marcellus shale; Nora; and the Barnett shale.  Approximately 90% of our 2009 budget will be spent in these three areas.  This portfolio has resulted in Range consistently delivering top tier organic production in reserve growth with one of the lowest cost structures in the business.", "According to Bank of America\u2019s research considering all in costs which includes F&D, LOE, G&A, interest expense and basin differentials, Range has the lowest or second lowest cost structure of the group of companies they cover for the last four years in a row.  This is a direct result of our simple strategy of strong organic growth at top core tail cost structure or better and in addition consistently building and high grading our inventory coupled with one of the best teams in the industry.  ", "Range has more upside today and lower risk upside than at any time in the company\u2019s history.  Today we have the opportunity to grow the company more than 10 fold primarily from the Marcellus shale, Nora and the Barnett shale.  Contrast that with Range\u2019s position five years ago when the upside was less than double the base.  Five years ago one third of Range\u2019s production came from the Gulf of Mexico.  Since then, we sold the offshore properties, sold marginal low rate wells in Big Lake and Mills Strain fields in West Texas, sold high cost low rate production in East Texas and divested of Austin Chalk properties in Texas.", "We generated the modern Marcellus idea in 2004, acquired our initial interest in Nora at the end of 2004 and entered the Barnett shale play in 2006.  We\u2019ve continued to grow and expand all three plays through new and innovative ideas that have resulted in the great positions and opportunities we have today.  We believe our excellent growth combined with an excellent cost structure coupled with an upside 20 times our base with result in creating strong shareholder returns over time.  ", "Back to you John.", "John H. Pinkerton ", "Now, let\u2019s turn to 2009.  Looking to 2009 it\u2019s obviously going to be both challenging and an exciting year for Range.  Obviously the macroeconomic climate and the low commodity prices will be challenging.  We\u2019re extremely excited about our opportunities and regarding the Marcellus shale play our goal in 2009 is to ramp up development by increasing our drilling and tripling our production.  ", "In the fourth quarter of last year we were able to move from the R&D phase to the initial development phase.  The first phase of the infrastructure was completed October and we were able to increase production to 30 million a day net by year end.  In 2009 we are increasing our drilling activity and anticipate exiting the year at 80 to 100 million a day net.  In addition, we will focus on continuing to bring down our well costs as we bring on our new fit for purpose drilling rigs.", "The good news is that we\u2019re off to a great start.  As Jeff mentioned, our drilling results continue to exceed our expectations as our last horizontal well IP\u2019d for over 10 million a day and we drilled a vertical well in the northeast portion of Pennsylvania that IP\u2019d for over 6 million a day.  In addition, the second phase of the infrastructure is proceeding as planned as the initial cryogenic processing plant should be up and running by early April.", "Mark West, our infrastructure partner continues to perform well and the recent announcement where they brought in an equity partner with $200 million of capital to specifically fund their Marcellus midstream operations is great news for Range and its shareholders.  Regarding the Marcellus shale play we have discovered what many believe is a giant natural gas field.  When you look back in history, there are only a handful of companies of Range\u2019s size that have discovered and developed fields of this potential magnitude.", "In 2008 we not only moved from the R&D phase to the development phase but we captured a lot of the resource potential by increasing our acreage position by roughly 50% to nearly 900,000 acres in the fairway of the play.  This is tremendous for Range and its shareholders.  To put our 900,000 net acres in perspective, the core of the Barnett shale play is a little more than 2 million net acres and the largest acreage position in the core held by any single company is 650,000 net acres held by Devon Energy a $20 billion market cap company.", "XTO and Chesapeake together own 473,000 net acres in the core of the Barnett.  XTO\u2019s market cap is $18 billion while Chesapeake\u2019s market cap is approximately $10 billion.  The important thing that our shareholders should focus on is the potential per share impact that the Marcellus shale play can have on Range.  We\u2019re not a large independent like Devon, XTO and Chesapeake who on average have roughly four times as  many shares outstanding as compared to Range. ", "Said a different way, our 900,000 net acre position will have roughly four times the impact on Range\u2019s per share value versus the three companies discussed above.  This is why we say at Range we care more about our NAV per share versus our market capitalization.  If we achieve 100 million a day of net Marcellus production by yearend 2009 the three larger companies would have to be at a rate of 400  million per day to have the same per share impact.  To the extent that they have sold off or own less than 100% working interest in their leases then they would have to produce an even greater amount.", "While we have great respect for the three larger companies mentioned about, the point I\u2019m trying to make is that it\u2019s not about aggregate size or aggregate growth, it\u2019s about size and growth per share.  In 2008 Range grew its production reserves per share on a dead adjusted basis by greater than 10% and at low cost.  Since 2004 we have grown in production and reserves per share on a dead adjusted basis at a compounded annual growth rate of more than 10% year.  ", "At Range that is what we are keenly focused on.  It\u2019s about increasing NAV per share each year not having the largest market cap, the most rigs in operation or the highest aggregate production.  Now, I\u2019ll get off the soapbox and provide some of the details for 2009.  As mentioned in the release, our current capital budget for 2009 is $700 million.  Roughly 90% of the budget is attributable to the Barnett, Nora and the Marcellus shale play.", "We currently anticipate that 77% of the budget will be used to drill 315 net wells while the remaining $160 million will be used for acreage, seismic and pipeline infrastructure.  We are targeting a 10% production growth target for the year.  Depending on how the Marcellus wells hold up the timing of the next phases of the Marcellus infrastructure, how fast service costs continue to decline in combination with the timing of drilling the 10% production growth target has more upside than downside.", "It is our view that 2009 is not a year where we should push production growth to the high end of the range but focus on making sure we achieve very cost effective growth.  For the first quarter of 2009 we\u2019re looking for production to come in at 408 to 412 million a day.  The midpoint represents an 11% production growth versus the prior year and if successful will represent the 25th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth.  As Roger mentioned, we\u2019re looking for operating costs to be in the mid $0.90 for the first quarter which will be lower than the first quarter of 2008.  ", "With regard to drilling rigs in operation, we have 15 rigs running today.  This compares with 34 rigs in operation this time last year.  Importantly, our first fit for purpose Marcellus shale rig has been delivered to Appalachia and is now on location and being rigged up.  We anticipate spudding our first well with this rig within the next few days.  The second fit for purpose rig is scheduled to arrive in March, the third in August and the last three in the fourth quarter of 2009.  We believe these new rigs will make a significant impact on reducing drill time and costs.", "One of our objectives for 2009 is to continue to drive down our well costs in the Marcellus.  While equipment is important people are even more important.  Our Marcellus team in Pittsburg, home of the world champion Pittsburg Steelers now numbers 108 people versus 63 at this time last year.  We continue to add many high quality people to this team and I\u2019m extremely pleased with what they\u2019ve accomplished.  Better yet, I\u2019m excited about their potential as we have some of the best shale expertise in the business working each and every day on this play exclusively for Range.  ", "Getting back to the capital budget, we cut the budget to $700 million in an effort to keep spending in line with cash flow.  Given our excellent liquidity position which Roger discussed, we are in a great position to capture unique opportunities in core areas that might avail themselves this year.  Given the high degree of operational control, we will and will remain flexible as to the capital budget.  The good news is that at $5 flat NYMEX gas prices, our drilling projects in the Marcellus, Nora and Barnett all generated over a 30% rate of return.  I\u2019m obviously delighted that 81% of our 2009 gas production is hedged at an average floor price of $7.62 per MCF.  ", "While we accomplished a lot in 2008, I believe the majority of our efforts will benefit 2009 and beyond.  As you heard from Jeff, we now have projects in our drilling inventory in emerging plays that have 20 to 28 TCF of nut unrisk resources potential.  This equates to eight to 10 times our existing proved reserves.  ", "For example, we are now starting to unlock the upside of the Nora area.   Besides the bread and butter CBM drilling we\u2019re not accelerating the tie gas and shale gas horizontal potential of this 300,000 acre field.  In the Barnet we now have over 1,000 high quality drilling locations in the core of the play.  In western Oklahoma we\u2019ve identified a high quality play in the St. Louis formation.  ", "Lastly, in our Marcellus shale play in Appalachia we\u2019ve made enormous progress from discovering the play with our first vertical well in 2004 that came in at roughly 800 MCF today to today where our last 13 horizontal wells have had initial production rates of 6.9 million a day, we have made incredible headway.  ", "In summary we are in a superb position to add materially to our NAV per share in 2009 and over the next several years and are keenly focused on delivering.  Finally, I\u2019d like to publically congratulate and thank our talented team of roughly 850 employees for a job exceedingly well done in 2008.  We have set the bar high for 2009 but I\u2019m confident that with the talent, dedication and passion of the range team we will meet or exceed our goals for the year.", "With that operator, why don\u2019t we turn the call over for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)   Your first question comes from Tom Gardner \u2013 Simmons & Co. ", "Tom Gardner \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "With respect to your production growth estimates for \u201909 of 10% can you walk us through area-by-area what you\u2019re actually thinking, what your thoughts are on those areas?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "Let me just talk about it overall.  Like we talked about 90% of our capital is going in to the Marcellus, the Barnett or Nora and we expect to get good growth or great growth out of all those areas.  That being said, we\u2019ve got a lot of tight gas sand production in Appalachia where we\u2019re not going to be drilling any wells, very little drilling out in the Permian basin and then all the other areas.  You\u2019re coupling the decline from the base production in those areas which is relatively low with the growth that we have.", "So, I think that given even out of the $700 million a lot of that money is being directed in to leasehold, seismic, pipeline and facilities.  Given the amount of drilling work we\u2019re doing 10% growth is great.  If gas prices rebound next year like I expect that they will we really have the opportunity to ramp up and get significant growth really for years to come out of those key projects.", "Tom Gardner \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "Did I hear you mention 16% base decline companywide earlier?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "We\u2019ve said that before.  If you look at the first year decline sort of in aggregate for the company that would be the base decline and then it flattens going out farther.", "Tom Gardner \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "You mentioned with regard to your planned asset sales or those that you\u2019re considering, are you talking about a sizeable package?  And, where might these properties be located?", "John H. Pinkerton ", "We currently formally have on the market our Fuhrman-Mascho property out in West Texas which is a shallow oil property but it has tremendous upside in terms of the Railroad Commission just approved five acre spacing infield wells and also its got some terrific water flood and tertiary opportunities.  Over the years we\u2019ve had a number of companies approach us wanting to know if we wanted to sell those properties and our thought was \u2013 well, to be honest with you I wish we had sold it or put it up for sale a year ago.", "But, given the opportunities we see in the proposed three areas we just felt it made sense to go ahead and put the property up for sale and see what we can fetch for it.  That\u2019s happening.  We should know something within the next five or six weeks.  Obviously, not a great time to sell it but again, it has enormous upside so it might be one of those things that if they can give us a little credit for that we\u2019ll go ahead and dispose of that and take those funds to capture more opportunities in the other areas that we operate that we think we can make quite frankly higher rates of return.", "That\u2019s the real strategy.  If we don\u2019t get a decent price for it we\u2019ll just keep it, operate it and look to selling it at a later time when prices rebound and when the capital markets open.  So, we\u2019ve got that property for sale and then we\u2019ve got some other assets that we\u2019ve been talking to people about on and off and quite frankly, those are smaller things and it all comes down to I think in each case the buyers really wanted to buy them and we\u2019ve given them kind of numbers that we\u2019re willing to sell them at the question is can they get financing for them.", "In some cases these are below $50 million so it\u2019s in the small range and as you know, it\u2019s really tough financing right now.  So again, the way I kind of look at it is a little bit simple, like we look at everything here, we have kind of a little buffet of assets that we\u2019ll consider selling and from time-to-time if other companies can come up with a number that we can support and it funds what we\u2019re doing in other areas well go ahead and let them go, if not we\u2019ll keep them.  Because, most cases just like Fuhrman, they\u2019re pretty low decline properties.  ", "But, as Jeff mentioned, I think the key really is when it comes to these assets sales, what are you really trying to accomplish as a company and we\u2019ve made the decision many years ago again, that we don\u2019t care how big we are we just care about what the NAV is and what the stock price is.  At the end of the day to the extent that we can sell Fuhrman or anything else and then reallocate that capital in to what we think are higher growth or higher rate of return projects, we think it just makes incredibly good sense for us and our shareholders.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David Tameron \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets.", "David Tameron \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets", "Jeff, can you talk a little bit about Northeast?  Talk about where you drilled the vertical, differences you\u2019re seeing there versus some of the stuff you drilled down the horizontal area?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "When we started back in the play back in 2004 we identified multiple areas that we liked and that\u2019s where we focused our acreage.  Across those acreage positions we\u2019ve started in each of them by drilling vertical wells to test and gather information and to learn.  The area we started obviously first in is down in the southwest.  Since we started there first we\u2019ve drilled horizontal wells there faster and we\u2019ve ramped up production faster but we like the results that we see in other areas particularly in the Northeast.   ", "We announced a well just today over 6 million per day which is the highest rate vertical well that anybody has had to date.  Again, I don\u2019t want anyone to forget our 24.5 million a day horizontal well a day either because we\u2019re awful proud of that one.  But, what it shows is that although we\u2019ve got 50,000 acres in the Southwest, don\u2019t forget that we\u2019ve got 350,000 acres in the Northeast and we\u2019ve got multiple delineation wells on that acreage and some of them are pretty spectacular and of course Cabot\u2019s had good success up in the Northeast and Chesapeake has drilled a good well up there now.", "So, we\u2019ve got good acreage positions scattered across both plays and just a tremendous upside so we\u2019re really excited by what we see so far.  This year primarily we\u2019re focused on driving up production.  A lot of that is going to be in the Southwest.  Next year you\u2019ll see us continue to drive production up there but also start to do a lot of drilling in the Northeast as well.", "David Tameron \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets", "Why type of lease commitments do you have in the Northeast for 2009?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "We\u2019re in good shape, we\u2019re not really drilling right now the whole acreage although we\u2019re cognoscente of that.  We\u2019re lucky enough again, our roots started in the Appalachian basin so  we had acreage positions in some of those key areas to start with and of course we\u2019ve added to it.  Fortunately, we\u2019re in stack pay areas, some of those leases are already held by production from shallower horizons that were produced there historically or deeper horizons in some cases that are produced historically and we\u2019ve got good term on our leases.", "So, we\u2019re really focused on drilling the best rate of return wells that we can, driving up production, delineating our position and holding acreage.  It\u2019s a combination of all those things.", "David Tameron \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets", "One more question on the Appalachian and then I\u2019ll let somebody else jump on.  Can you just talk about severance tax that\u2019s floating around in the budget that was recently submitted I guess it was a couple of weeks back?", "Roger S. Manny ", "Just to give everyone a background, one of the unique things about Pennsylvania is it does not have a oil and gas severance tax currently.  It doesn\u2019t have a state income tax.  There\u2019s plenty of other taxes in Pennsylvania, don\u2019t get me wrong but it currently does not have an oil and gas severance tax.  With the short fall in revenues in the state the governor as well as some of the other legislatures have discussed publically the idea of instituting a severance tax.  ", "We and the rest of the Marcellus shale committee have had extensive discussions with the governor and his staff as well as some of the key legislative people in the state not to try to in ways swing them one way or the other but give them the facts in terms of what Texas and Oklahoma, Arkansas and some of the other states have done with regards to some of these shale plays.  ", "It\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s interesting, the more you tax it early on the longer it\u2019s going to take to ramp up and likewise.  So, I think everybody understands, at least to a reasonable degree the issues, the question is what are they going to do and that we don\u2019t know.  We\u2019re not na\u00efve, we have historically run our models assuming a severance tax so we think long term there will be one.  ", "So, it\u2019s something that is coming, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been aware of.  We\u2019re certainly receiving the benefit now of having no severance tax but that\u2019s kind of the way we see it.  We\u2019ll continue to monitor it to the extent that we can be helpful and provide education, we\u2019ll continue to do that.", "David Tameron \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets", "What\u2019s the timing on the budget just so we have that?  Do you have that?", "Roger S. Manny ", "It\u2019s not so much exactly timed to the budget but I would expect that they\u2019ll discuss this and possible vote on something this year, no doubt.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Joe Allman \u2013 J. P. Morgan.", "Joe Allman \u2013 J. P. Morgan", "I guess Jeff, current production out of the Marcellus what are you guys running out there right now?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "Of course we\u2019ve got the plant at 30 million per day capacity, we\u2019re actually running over that somewhat.  We haven\u2019t been specific.  We\u2019ll have the second piece on here like I mentioned, adding another 30 million per day and we expect to once that\u2019s on and of course there\u2019s always a little start up problem with every time you get a new plant you\u2019ve got to work the bugs out but we expect we\u2019ll get production up pretty quick on that and I feel comfortable we\u2019ll exit the year at $80 to $100 million per day net which again, I think is phenomenal or excellent particularly considering the number of rigs we\u2019re running.", "We\u2019re not running 20 rigs to get that rate.  John went through the schedule of how we\u2019re going to ramp up.  We currently have three rigs and come the end of the year we\u2019ll have roughly six rigs.", "John H. Pinkerton ", "In a way, it\u2019s going to be a little bit like an offshore platform.  We\u2019re going to go from say plus or minus 30 million a day where we are today to 60 million a day once we get the first cryogenic plant on in April.  So then we\u2019ll max that out pretty quickly.  We\u2019ve got about 14 wells that we\u2019ve already drilled that in some cases tested and in some cases not, they\u2019re just waiting on the next phase of infrastructure so we\u2019ll fill that up pretty quickly.", "Like in anything that\u2019s mechanical, it will take a few weeks, maybe a month to sort all the kinks out and then we\u2019ll fill that up.  The good news is that our friends at Mark West are doing a terrific job.  While they\u2019re building the first cryogenic plant they\u2019re already also simultaneously building the second cryogenic plant which is a 120 million a day plant which is scheduled to come on either late this year or early in January of next year.", "So, we\u2019re real pleased with that.  I couldn\u2019t be happier.  I give them an A plus.  Frank and the guys at Mark West are doing a tremendous job.  So, in our view we picked the right partner.  They\u2019re spending that capital we\u2019re not and we\u2019re really focusing on ramping up the production, driving down our costs and really trying to focus on the highest rate of return projects for us.  So, from all that perspective it\u2019s going great.", "When you think of it we will be capacity constrained throughout the year but by the end of the year we won\u2019t so that\u2019s important.  The other thing is as we drill in the Northeast part where you don\u2019t need to be processed then we won\u2019t be constrained there.  So, the good news as Jeff mentioned, 80 to 100 million a day, that looks good.  That\u2019s a tripling of our production, that\u2019s an easy task but we feel very good about that.  Then by the end of this year then we\u2019ll have the wind to our back in terms of the infrastructure then we\u2019ll be able to really ramp it up from there.", "Joe Allman \u2013 J. P. Morgan", "But down in the Northeast though you do have to build some more infrastructure there right?  To develop that?", "John H. Pinkerton ", "Yes but, it\u2019s relatively easy stuff.  What it is, is just pure midstream pipeline and gathering.  It\u2019s not big 42 inch lines.  What\u2019s interesting in the Marcellus which is different than a lot of the shale plays is that the infrastructure is all related to midstream in that if you think of the Appalachian basin and where the bulk, or what we think the bulk of the goodies of the Marcellus is going to be, I think it\u2019s either four of the top six or five of the top seven largest pipelines in the US run right through the middle of the play.", "So, it\u2019s not a question of having to build huge 36 and 42 inch lines to cart this and what not, it\u2019s all about building anywhere from eight to 10 to 14 inch lines to these big main lines that go up to such great places like New York City, Boston and Philadelphia.  So, that\u2019s already in place.  We\u2019re working with Mark West on some of those things, we\u2019re doing some of it ourselves, pipe is going in the ground.  All that is going according to oil so we\u2019re very pleased on that.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "I was just going to add, remember as you get in to the Northeast it\u2019s dry gas so you don\u2019t need the processing like John said, it\u2019s just really gathering and compression there so you don\u2019t have that piece.", "Joe Allman \u2013 J. P. Morgan", "How about these two vertical wells you drilled, is there a rule of thumb in the Marcellus and what kind of rates might you see on the horizontals based on the vertical rates you\u2019re seeing?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "It\u2019s probably too early to say what the rule of thumb is.  Obviously, a 24 million a day well is pretty phenomenal and you look at what the vertical wells are down there that\u2019s a tremendous increase.  So, you can get outliers, I think it\u2019s too early to come up with a rule of thumb but I would say with 6 million a day vertical well I would expect that we will be drilling some pretty exciting horizontal wells up there as well.

Morgan", "How about the change in your production target from 15% to 20% to 10%, what\u2019s actually the change in activity that\u2019s causing you to bump that down?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "Well literally back in September and October when we first came out with that oil and gas prices were significantly higher so you were probably looking at cash flow back then of literally $900 million to maybe close to a billion.  So, with that we just had a lot more drilling in there so we have significantly less drilling and we think that\u2019s the prudent thing to do, to live within cash flow.  We think 10% growth living within cash flow in this environment still allowing us money to continue to pick up acreage and do other things is great. Like John said, if prices recover next year we\u2019ll have the wind in our sales and we\u2019ll be off to the races. ", "Joe Allman \u2013 J. P. Morgan", "Roger, you talked about NOLs, I missed that number and that was a yearend number I think?", "Roger S. Manny ", "Joe, it\u2019s $159 million is our yearend NOL carry forward.", "Joe Allman \u2013 J. P. Morgan", "The acreage position you\u2019ve got in the Marcellus the 900,000 acres, previously you use to talk about high graded acreage.  How much of that do you think is high graded?  Or, how would you characterize that?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "Well, we\u2019ve got about 1.4 million acres in the state so that roughly 900,000 was our high graded number.  ", "Joe Allman \u2013 J. P. Morgan", "Lastly, John you talked about unique opportunities that you might pursue, what are you thinking about in particular there?", "John H. Pinkerton ", "I can\u2019t tell you.  But, I\u2019ll give you a little bit of color on it.  If you sit back and think, I\u2019m sure you have and I do it every night when I put my head on the pillow, but you just sit back and you think about what is really precious today is obviously capital to do things with, with the fact that the capital markets have gotten either shut down or they\u2019re extremely expensive.  So, really the thing that is just so critical this year is what you do with every dollar is really of incredible importance.", "The thing that I go back and forth on is where should we be focused.  Clearly, we need to grow our company and continue to grow production reserves at low cost.  That\u2019s our strategy and we\u2019ll continue to do that.  With that being said, I do think that there is in this low price environment, is that where you ought to be very sensitive \u2013 for example, let\u2019s say that we ramp up and all of our Marcellus wells hold in the 24 million a day and all the ones that are 10 million a day hold in there at numbers that are going to exceed the 3 or 4 BCF that Jeff talked about. ", "If you think  about that, the question is then if you\u2019re going to hit the 100 million a day, you\u2019re going to max out that, should you take some of that extra capital you were going to spend on drilling and maybe do things like buy acreage in and around some of the sweet spots or if there\u2019s something incredibly cheap where somebody is in trouble, do you take advantage of that?  My view of it is and it obviously changes from day-to-day and it\u2019s more arts than science is that \u201909 what you want to do in my view is we want to hit double digit production growth at sub $2 drilling cost.", "Then, what we want to do is really be opportunistic and capture opportunities that are unique that will probably go away once gas prices go back up because, they will go back up.  We all know that and try and capture some of those unique opportunities.  The fact that a lot of these smaller companies, I mean we\u2019re a small company but there are a lot of companies smaller than us that are really going to be in tough shape this year in terms of capital and borrowing bases and everything else.  We\u2019ve had a number of them come to us with different ideas and we\u2019re going to be very careful about that just like we were last year.  ", "But, I do think this is a year where you will be able to do some things that will be very unique compared to the market two, three or four years from now.  That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.  Just be opportunistic and take advantage of that.  We make this business so much harder than it sometimes really is.  If you really think about it the biggest determinant in terms of acquisitions, in terms of rate of return is the commodity price environment you\u2019re in when you buy the asset. ", "So, if you buy assets when prices are low the ability to make a good return on that is a lot higher than the probability when you buy assets that are in $100 price environment of oil and $10 for gas.  That being said to the extent that we have a few dollars left over to buy some unique things in core areas, and when I say core areas these are things that are literally right next door to or directly associated with some of the major things we\u2019re doing.  We will not be active at all in new plays outside of our core areas.  Our sandboxes are plenty big enough right now to grow this company as we said anywhere from eight to 10 times with just the assets we own.  While we\u2019re going to be opportunistic we\u2019re also going to be very focused like we\u2019ve been in the past.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.", "A lot of good questions so far, one thing that stood out was the Hill County well rates and what you\u2019re seeing there.  When you think about the 61 wells in the Barnett how many are down around Hill County now?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "There\u2019s going to be very few.  Those wells that we\u2019re going to be drilling like I said it\u2019s going to be Tarrant and Johnson and the really core properties that are proven.  I am excited that the team drilled the industry\u2019s best well in Hill County to date and that looks like a strong well and it\u2019s performing well.  But, in this environment where you have really limited drilling dollars, we\u2019re going to focus on our highest rates of return best growth projects.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.", "As you think about the splits of capital kind of a couple hundred million in the Marcellus and kind of $150 to $180 million in the Barnett, is that about the right order of magnitude or do you have the exact numbers for drilling capital?", "Roger S. Manny ", "You\u2019re going to spend about $150 million in drilling in the Barnett, about $200 million or more in the Marcellus, about $75 million at Nora.  So you\u2019re big three is going to be about $450 million of drilling dollars.  If you look at total budgets of infrastructure, land and things like that, that\u2019s going to be almost $600 million out of the $700 million coming to the big three.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "A lot of that infrastructure and land is all going to be predominately in the Appalachian basin.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering & Co.", "Then kind of final question, what are you thinking about 2010 hedges?", "John H. Pinkerton ", "A very interesting question.  My view of it is the cure for low prices is low prices.  So, David you were kind enough to ask the question so let me kind of expand it and I\u2019ll get back and I\u2019ll answer your question but let me speak just a little bit about what our view more on a macro basis what the market is doing and give you a little bit of insight because I think it\u2019s interesting is if you think about \u201904, \u201905, \u201906, \u201907 everybody came out with capital budgets and production increases at the beginning of the year.  ", "What happened was all throughout the year people were increasing their budgets, doing acquisitions and increasing their production and reserve estimates throughout  the year.  That became very much the norm.  I mean, we were a classic example, that little chicken John Pinkerton would come out with low double digit production growths and we\u2019d end up every year at 20% as drilling did better and we did a few little acquisitions.", "I think 2009 is going to be the difference and I think what people are doing is reflective of that in that they\u2019re coming out \u2013 I mean, we were a perfect example, our original capital budget was well over $1 billion when we were thinking early fourth quarter, late third quarter of last year.  Then, we\u2019ve got it I think three times since then and we may cut it again.  We\u2019ll continue to think about it. ", "But, if you look at all the companies across the spectrum and there were like three yesterday and one today, everybody is cutting their budgets and they\u2019re going to be decreasing their production targets throughout the year and we\u2019re only in to February.  We\u2019ve only got 15% of the year done, we\u2019ve got 85% of the year to go.  So, if you just extrapolate that out and without even gas prices coming down any further and I do think they\u2019ll come down a little further before they jump back up, you\u2019re going to see people really cut back in terms of production growth.", "The other thing is that the rig market is in a free fall.  I\u2019ve never seen it like this in my career.  I\u2019ve been at Range for 20 years and I\u2019ve been in the business for over 30 years.  I\u2019ve never seen a free fall like this in terms of drilling rigs and services like I\u2019m seeing today.  The other thing is I\u2019ve never seen companies more scared today than I\u2019ve ever seen in my career.  I think what it is, is a lot companies are looking around the portfolio and essentially nothing is economic at today\u2019s prices.  ", "I think that being said I think the industry is showing a lot of financial restraint and they\u2019re dropping rigs, people are paying money to get out of rig contracts, I\u2019ve never seen that before.  When you look at it you\u2019re going to see a dramatic response on the supply side.  The big question and David if you and I knew what the exact timing of that we\u2019d be the richest guys on the planet earth is I don\u2019t know when and neither do you.  The question is we know it\u2019s going to be fairly soon here and in that regard I think the cure for low prices is low prices.", "Because of that we\u2019re going to be very disciplined in the way we view the market.  We are completely unhedged for 2010.  We are going to be very cautious in terms of pushing those hedges on until we see numbers we think are reflective of the underlying value of those molecules of natural gas.  If you look back in time there have been just recently in this decade, there was a time when gas price in the futures market hit $1.80 and two months later I think it was above $5.  ", "Again, you\u2019re going to see that and when it happens I don\u2019t know when but it will happen.  There\u2019s no doubt in my mind.  It\u2019s even every piece of data I see as it comes across the tape and just talking to other CEOs and just seeing what\u2019s going on and in terms of both on the service side and E&P side, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s going to happen.  So, that being said, we\u2019re going to hedge, we\u2019re just not going to hedge at these prices.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael A. Hall \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus. ", "Michael A. Hall \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Kind of hammering on Northeast Pennsylvania a little more, can you provide any color in terms of what you saw in terms of reservoir characteristics or frac barriers, things along those lines with your vertical wells?  Kind of in the context of Southwest too on a relative basis.", "John H. Pinkerton ", "I appreciate the question and what not. As you know, this play there\u2019s still a lot of acreage out there to be leased and we\u2019ve drilled more wells in the play than everybody else combined.  We really view that as a competitive advantage.  We\u2019re still picking up leases so we\u2019re going to be very quite in terms of the questions you just asked.  So, I\u2019ll have to just not answer it quite frankly.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "I can give you the generic answer.  We saw things we really liked and we ended up with a good well.", "Michael A. Hall \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Looking at the rigs you\u2019re bringing up in to Pennsylvania, have you  been able to renegotiate on any of those terms? And, what are the date rates you\u2019re carrying on those rigs?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m going to give you specific numbers.  What I will say is when you look around it\u2019s been a very interesting year in terms of service costs.  Like John said, people are dropping rigs rapidly and then you\u2019re going to get in to differences in areas where you are in the country.  Probably actually one of the more competitive areas is going to be the Appalachian basin because the economics are better there than in most places.  Haynesville is drilling, a lot of activity in the Haynesville. ", "In the Barnett even though you still generate some good economics given people trying to live within cash flow and oil and gas prices so down and having to cut back so far and you have so many rigs there.  I\u2019ll give you an example of rig rates, I think at the peak in the Barnett which was a year to a year and a half ago rigs went as high as $28,500 per day.  Today, you can get rigs for under $10,000 a day.  So, that shows you how dramatically they\u2019ve dropped. But, that\u2019s a less competitive area.  ", "Obviously the midcontinent and Rockies are probably less competitive so I don\u2019t want to get in specifically to what we\u2019re paying for rigs in different areas.  But, I am excited that we have the built for purpose rigs up there.  They are more designed for the type of application we need.  They\u2019re really going to help us drive down our costs.  That will get us in a true development mode once this first rig spuds and we start drilling and I expect we\u2019re really going to post some great numbers by the end of the year.", "But, I think the theme throughout the year in general is going to be the bad news is oil and gas prices are low but the sort of offset to that somewhat is service costs are really coming down for everything from drilling rigs, to fracing, to steel and everything else.", "John H. Pinkerton ", "The interesting thing just to pile on to what Jeff said \u2013 the one thing that is interesting is that if you look at the Barnett shale for six straight years the rig count went up every single month.  Every single month the rig count would be higher than it was the month before.  You look at it today and it\u2019s less than half the rigs are working in the Barnett than there were six months ago.  That is incredible especially given the Barnett shale is the largest gas field in the US and Texas production would be down year-over-year if it wasn\u2019t for the Barnett.", "So, that gives you some idea.  The interesting thing in terms of how all this affects the Marcellus is that the equipment in the Barnett can be easily put on railcars or moved to Appalachia.  So, I think we\u2019re going to benefit from pressure pumping, the rigs and especially people.  One of the largest drilling contractors in the US I saw him at a conference not too long ago and he mentioned now he\u2019s got people lining up at his door willing to move to Appalachia.  That wasn\u2019t the case a year ago.", "So, the good thing is I think we\u2019ll see some flop back there in terms of this whole service cost mumbo jumbo as it moves in favor of the Appalachia.  As Jeff said, when you\u2019re only paying an eighth royalty, when you\u2019re getting premium to NYMEX versus $1 to $2 difference to NYMEX it sure makes those wells up in Appalachia  a lot more economic on a relative basis.  So, you\u2019re going to see a lot of equipment I think move up to the Appalachia basin and that is just unbelievably good news for the Marcellus, not only for Range, but the entire Marcellus shale play in general.  So, in some respects the pull back in prices is going to have a really profound effect in terms of the service infrastructure in the Marcellus.  I think it\u2019s going to be one of the direct beneficiaries.  ", "Michael A. Hall \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Finally, the asset sales, are any asset sales or production sales assumed in the current guidance of 10% growth?  Or, how should we think about that?", "John H. Pinkerton ", "Not a whole lot but on the other end of it when we put down a number obviously we had some idea that we would be selling some stuff.  But, if we do any material sells we\u2019ll come back to you with the new production number.  But again, it all depends if we sell early in the year it will have a bigger impact than if we sell later in the year and all the other stuff that comes in those kinds of things.", "Michael A.

Ventura ", "Well, I will answer part of your question, yes it was vertical well but exactly how we completed it and what we pumped like John said for competitive reasons for right now we want to keep that tight.  Obviously, other people are coming up with recipes and formulas.  Atlas has drilled some very good vertical wells as has Cabot and others.  But, we\u2019ve invested a lot of time and capital and effort to get where we are so until that acreage position is pretty locked up we\u2019ll keep that tight.", "The other thing I hope you guys do appreciate is since we started this endeavor we\u2019ve kept peeling back more and more layers of the onion, giving more and more information.  So, we\u2019re trying to be more and more transparent but because of competitive leasing reasons we\u2019re going to have to keep some stuff tight.", "Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Then in Southwest, I think you mentioned you hope to get to $3 to $4 million per well completed cost.  What is actual cost running now?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "Obviously they\u2019re a little more than that but there\u2019s three easy ways we\u2019ll get there, maybe four.  One, is we still have science in the wells and although trouble costs are coming down they\u2019re not zero.  If you eliminate the science and trouble out of our more recent wells we\u2019d be $3.2 to $3.3 million.  Obviously, once you know you drill 100 or whatever the magic number is horizontal wells or 150 or something your trouble costs are going to approach zero and obviously we won\u2019t need the science.", "That being said, getting these built for fit for purpose rigs in and then just being in a declining service cost environment, I\u2019m comfortable our guys will get there.  They may even break through the low end in the Southwest.  ", "Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "What\u2019s the sort of spud to completion time in the Southwest now?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "Spud to spud on our best wells is about 20 days, 21 days, something like that.  Then they\u2019ll come back and complete the wells later on and that\u2019s a function of where the pipeline is and timing and a lot of other stuff.  The fracs in some aspects aren\u2019t a whole lot different here than in the Barnett so depending on how long the lateral is and how many stages you have fracing may take three to five days or something like that.", "Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "With the fit for purpose rigs, what do you think that number can go down to?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "Again, to use an analogy of the Barnett, we\u2019ve gotten as low as 10 days per well spud to TD type thing.  Depending on where you are again it\u2019s a little more complex up there, you have cold strings and other things that you have to do.  But, I think in time, maybe on well 200 or something out of 6,000 or however many we end up drilling, you might approach 10 or 12 days per well.  I know our guys listen to these calls so there\u2019s  your challenge.", "John H. Pinkerton ", "Just to pile on what Jeff said, what\u2019s interesting is what got us there \u2013 for example in Hood County, right on the corner of Hood and Johnson County where we\u2019ve had a fair amount of success at the Mitchell Range, I think our first well cost $3.6 million and took us over 30 days and we brought in a fit for purpose rig after I think wells number 16, 17 and 18 and we drilled them on a single pad sequentially and we drilled all three of those wells in 31 days and I think cost were $1.6 to $1.8 million each completed.", "I think that recipe really holds true to any shale play quite frankly unless you\u2019re in maybe the deeper part of the Haynesville that\u2019s way over pressured and its got a lot of mechanical issues and extra drill strings and stuff, if you think about the Southwest PA it\u2019s not too much different both in terms of vertical depth and laterals that we\u2019re doing in Hood County Texas.  From that perspective having fit for purpose rigs that are smaller that can move around instead of being 18 wheeler roads to move them like these big rigs we\u2019ve got now that come down to maybe three 18 wheelers with no cranes, that\u2019s a big cost savings in terms of moving it from location to location.", "The other thing is one of the things we think is really important is to really aggregate your acreage up and get big blocks of acreage which is really hard to do in Appalachia because the acreage blocks,  I think our average lease is 200 acres so to the extent that we\u2019ve had 30 years in some cases the aggregate all these acres and we\u2019ve got big [yellow] blocks of acres to the extent that you can drill multiple wells from a single pad really reduces your road costs, really reduces your pipeline costs, it really reduces your mope cost on your drilling rig.  That will save you an enormous amount of money.", "It all gets back to the efficiencies and what not and how you charter all this stuff out.  Again, those are some of the things that we\u2019re going to be really focused on during 2009.  That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to get the cost down.  If you think about some of the numbers that Jeff talked about, if it\u2019s $500,000 per well that we can save in all the stuff that we\u2019ve learned this year and next year we drill I don\u2019t know how many wells, let\u2019s say it\u2019s a couple of hundred, that\u2019s $100 million.  If we drill 100 wells next year that\u2019s $50 million.  It\u2019s huge amounts of money.  That\u2019s why we\u2019re so focused in terms of getting the per well cost down.", "If you think about the size of the play four years from now we\u2019re going to have a gazillion rigs up there running so to the extent that we can save $300 to $500 per location with a gazillion rigs and you run that math, that\u2019s a gazillion dollars.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "Just to add on to what John saying not only is it cheaper, these new rigs are actually going to have walkers and stompers where you can literally move the rig in less than a day, it will move itself in a matter of hours.  Environmentally, it\u2019s a better thing to do drill off a pad, you\u2019re disturbing less land, it\u2019s better for the land owner, you\u2019re disturbing less of the land owners\u2019 land.  So, there\u2019s a lot of other reasons to do that as well.  It\u2019s economically the right thing to do but for the land owner and the environment it\u2019s the right thing to do too.", "Operator", "", "Your final question comes from Rehan Rashid \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc.", "Rehan Rashid \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc.", "On the decline rates let\u2019s just say for your 24 million a day well, I know it\u2019s very early but is it kind of tracking what you would  see at a less of an IP rate well?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "Let me put it this way, I\u2019ll just be fairly straight forward, it\u2019s early but a well like that could have reserves of 8 to 10 Bs or something like that.  So, when we talk about average reserves of 3 to 4 Bs, like John mentioned when you\u2019re getting these wells that are 10 million or 10 million a day plus obviously they\u2019re going to be better than that.  So, when you look at our wells in aggregate, so far in the Marcellus and our oldest well now has been on for a pretty reasonable amount of time approaching it will be two years this August and you plot those wells versus the Barnett and they compare very favorably.  So we\u2019re pleased with what we see so far.", "Rehan Rashid \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc.", "When do you reach a statistical number of wells that you can say okay I\u2019m willing to address my EUR guidance in either direction?  Is it 50 wells, is it 100 wells, 200 wells?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "Well, it\u2019s a combination of a number of wells and time.  You need to get enough time to really see those curves and at the end of the day it\u2019s going to be like all plays where you are makes a big difference.  Whether you\u2019re in the high quality core best parts of the play or whether you\u2019re way out on the fringe.  So, you\u2019re not going to be able to apply one number across the entire play.  There\u2019s going to be good areas in there and poor areas.  Obviously we\u2019ve drilled some excellent areas but we will with more history and more time and more wells refine those numbers.", "I think our numbers so far, I think the range of costs of $3 to $4 million per day for 3 to 4 BCF I certainly still feel comfortable with those numbers.  When you consider that those kind of numbers at the midpoint of the play give you finding costs of just a little over $1 and rates of return that are pretty phenomenal regardless of what gas price you use, I feel really good about that.  ", "The other thing we\u2019re learning in the play so far, it\u2019s not just Ranges wells but you\u2019re getting other peoples\u2019 well that sort of confirm and validate the play as well.  Going back to the Southwest, Range has had great results but that area, that 550,000 acres in a lot of way has been somewhat derisked by drilling from Atlas and Chesapeake and Equitable and CNX and Range and a lot of people that have had good results.  ", "It says a lot about our acreage position in that area.  In fact, I can\u2019t think of any bad results in there so far.  If you go up to the Northeast there\u2019s been also not just Range drilling and announcing good wells but Cabot has announced good wells up there, Chesapeake has announced good wells up there and there are others as well.  Southwest  will be drilling, there\u2019s a lot of name brand companies up there and throughout the play.", "Rodney is queuing me in on some of the areas that haven\u2019t worked so well and some of the other companies but I only like to talk positively about Range and our brethren but then you guys know what wells haven\u2019t worked up there and I think where they are.

Ventura ", "Well, the BTU is similar to the Barnett you\u2019re going to get as you go east on the eastern side your dry gas is about 1,000 BTU and as you go farther west it gets rich and the rich gas areas, 1,300 or 1,400 BTUs.  Then, if you just continually go west way in to Ohio some where you probably get oily just like in the Barnett if you go way, way west eventually you get oily.  So, you\u2019ll see that range throughout the play.  There are good wells in the dry areas and there\u2019s good wells in the high BTU areas.", "Rehan Rashid \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc.", "Your average that we kind of heard this morning 6.9 that is a kind of BTU adjusted number, right?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "No, that\u2019s adjusted for liquids.  That\u2019s a million cubic feet per day equivalent, that\u2019s not BTU adjusted.  Obviously, once you process the gas, you produce the gas \u2013 I\u2019ll just talk about the wet gas, you produce the gas, some of them will produce some liquid initially so you get the gas and then you run that gas through the plant and you produce liquids from the plant and then the residue gas in the rich areas, even after processing might be 1,150 to 1,200 and then we get paid that BTU uplift.", "So, in the wet areas you\u2019ll get the gas plus a BTU uplift plus the liquids.  So, really it helps the economics and enhances it and in the dry gas area it\u2019s basically dry gas is 1,000 BTU, you get paid what you get paid.  But, there\u2019s good wells in both areas.", "Rehan Rashid \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc.", "The last question, on the processing capacity front, you\u2019re adding something early \u2018010 as well, right?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "We\u2019re adding a big cryo plant that will either be end of this year or early \u2019010 that will really significantly increase capacity.  The guys are doing a very good job of staying ahead of the drilling machine.  We want to make sure we\u2019re drilling the highest rates of return, best quality wells at the same delineating our acreage but, the pipelines and processing and takeaway are staying ahead of the drilling machine.  So, we\u2019ve got a good team working in a very integrated way to make sure we have all those pieces in place to continue to drive our success.", "John H. Pinkerton ", "The one thing that has been surprising is when we first put the infrastructure plan we used that kind of 3 to 4 BCF and we used the kind of IPs associated with that.  So, what happened was when we hit some of these bigger wells in terms of just compression and what not we had a really high graded problem there.  So, in some of these cases we tested wells and we just shut them in and we\u2019re waiting for the infrastructure to catch up a little bit.  ", "But again, one of the really neat things about the Marcellus and there\u2019s been a lot written on it is it\u2019s really just a midstream issue and as the play really develops out there is no place on the planet earth you\u2019d rather have gas than the Marcellus shale play because it really works in a big way.  Some of the basis differentials you see in the Rockies is really going to affect other areas because this play is going to have such a monumental impact not so much us but you hear about what other people think the play is going to be.", "It is exactly where you want to be selling BTUs of gas.  Two thirds of the population of the United States lives within 350 mile radius of Pittsburg Pennsylvania, home of the Super Bowl Champions Pittsburg Steelers.  So, it\u2019s a great place to sell gas.  What\u2019s interesting is it\u2019s really neat to see some of the proposals we\u2019ve seen in terms of long term gas infrastructure, some of the partnerships that people want to do with us in terms of long term supply, in terms of electric supply and generation and what not, it\u2019s really cool.", "All that being said, we\u2019re keeping our head down, we\u2019re in the bunker, we just want to hit 100 million a day this year and we want to drive down our cost and drive up production.  As Jeff has said, I think this is hopefully coming through loud and clear, we really feel like we\u2019ve derisked the play to a large extent.  A lot of you on the call obviously don\u2019t know what we know and therefore are going to risk what we say and that\u2019s appropriate.  ", "But, as we get to 30 million and as we get to the middle of the year we\u2019ll be up more and a we get to the end of the year 100 million, then if you just look and Southwestern is a perfect example, once they got to 100 million a day to where they are today, a lot of the risk is gone and then it\u2019s just a question of getting more rigs and more people and making the commitment and driving it up.  We\u2019re doing that.  We\u2019ve got 108 people, knowing Ray he\u2019s probably got 120 people as of today because he hires people faster than I can approve them.", "We\u2019ve got more office space, we\u2019re making all the commitments that we need to really drive this play up to be a really big time gas play.  Again, I can\u2019t say more about our people up there led by Ray Walker and Steve Rupert and John [Applegath] and the others we have up there, Matt [Curry].  We\u2019ve just got a really first class \u2013 Dan [Cotterman] and [Greg Davis], we\u2019ve got a real first class group of people up there that really know what they\u2019re doing.  They\u2019re going to be driving the production up and if they can do it they\u2019ll all get rich just like we will because we\u2019re all fully invested in the Range.", "Rehan Rashid \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc.", "Just one more question, on the cost front Jeff I\u2019m trying to remember my numbers but I think you mentioned that $3 to $4 million and then when we go in to development mode sub $3.  As you kind of go out based on kind of service infrastructure where it is today and maybe not as dislocated as it could be the next few months but some sort of average in between, where do you think is a good number to settle it down to $2 to $2.5?  Or, is that too aggressive?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "I think once we get all of our fit for purpose rigs in there and drill a few more wells I think in the Southwest part of the play we\u2019ll be in that $3 to $4 million slot and towards the low end.  Like I said, using the analogy of Hood County and John mentioned it again today, those wells are $1.6 million drilling complete today and falling.  You\u2019ve got to remember, it\u2019s not an apples-to-apples because you\u2019ve got cold strings, you\u2019ve got some different things in PA that you\u2019ve got to account for.  But, in time could they break $3 million and get to $2.5 million or something lower than that, those are certainly possible.   We\u2019ve got a first class team up there and I think those guys will do wonderful things.", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen this is the end of our electronic Q&A session.  I\u2019d like to hand it back over to Mr. Pinkerton for closing remarks.", "John H. Pinkerton ", "We thank you all for joining us today.  We\u2019ve obviously run over and we appreciate you all that stayed with us.  We had a lot of great questions.  2009 is going to be a real interesting year.  We\u2019re off to a great start.  We\u2019ve drilled some great wells.  Our production looks on track and we\u2019re going to behave ourselves in terms of the capital budget.  We look forward to continuing to give you results in the Marcellus as well as our other plays.", "I don\u2019t want to forget the other plays.  What\u2019s in Range is really our portfolio, our projects, the Barnett is important, Nora is important but so is the production that helped support that and the men and women in those other divisions they do a terrific job as well.  With that we\u2019ll sign off.  If anybody has any questions that we didn\u2019t answer feel free to call any of us and we\u2019ll be happy to answer those questions.  Thanks again and we\u2019ll see you after the first quarter.", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference.  Thank you for your participation.

This call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.", "Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome. Range reported results for the first quarter 2009 with record production beating the consensus numbers and clearly continuing to execute our business plan for 2009 given the volatility in the commodity market. The first quarter marked our 25 consecutive quarter of sequential production growth.", "On the call with me today are John Pinkerton, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Ventura, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Roger Manny, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Before turning the call over to John, I would like to cover a few administrative items. First, we did file our 10-Q with the SEC this morning. It is available on the home page of our website or you can access it using the SEC\u2019s EDGAR system.", "In addition we have posted on our website supplemental tables which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins on the reconciliations of our non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today. Tables are also posted on the website that will give you detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter.", "Second, while you own the home page of the website we would invite to you view our video report to stockholders for 2008 and get a copy of a primer on modern shale gas development in the United States published by the Department of Energy this month. A PDF copy is available on the left hand side of the home page.", "I believe the primary is an informative resource about the information on various shale plays and the regulatory and environmental issues that many of our investors and the public are asking about. Third, we are participating in several conferences and road shows in May; check our website for a complete listing for the next several months.", "We\u2019ll be on the road with RBC Capital in Toronto and Montreal on May 11 and 12. Calyon Energy Forum in New York on May 13, the UBS oil and gas conference on May 19 and the Deutsche Bank energy conference in Miami on May 28. Our annual stockholder meeting is being held in Fort Worth on May 20. We hope that each stockholder has received their proxy materials and urge each stockholder to vote for the proposals being submitted in the proxy.", "Now let me turn the call over to John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Rodney. Before Roger reviews the first quarter financial results, I will review some of the key accomplishments so far in 2009. On a year-over-year basis first quarter production rose 12% beating the high end of the guidance. This also marks the 25 consecutive quarter of sequential production growth.", "The driver for that higher than anticipated production were our exceptional drilling results during the quarter. Our drilling program was on schedule throughout the quarter as we drilled 101 wells. We continue to be extremely pleased with the drilling results and despite lower natural gas prices; we continue to generate very attractive returns on our capital.", "We currently have 15 rigs running versus 33 this time last year. On the financial side, our pardon me, our 12% increase in production was more than offset by a 31% decrease in realized prices. As a result, our first quarter financial results were lower than the prior period, and Roger will get into all the details.", "However, we\u2019re most pleased on the cost side. Our controllable costs were well inline with expectations. Unit operating costs for example came in at $0.93 per mcfe, well below last year. In regards to our emerging plays, in particular the Marcellus Shale play, we made significant head way during the quarter.", "We continued to drill some fantastic wells, expand our acreage position, began indoctrinating our new custom built rigs and continue to build out the infrastructure. In addition, we continue to add some high quality technical people to our team in Pittsburgh that runs our Marcellus play. All-in-all I couldn\u2019t be more pleased on what we\u2019ve done, so far in the year. It\u2019s a real testimony to the entire team at range.", "With that I will turn the call over to Roger to review the financial results.", "Roger Manny", "Thank you, John. The first quarter of 2009 is marked by another record quarter of oil and gas production of 12% from the first quarter of last year, continued good news on unit cost control and unfortunately, sharply lowers oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices on an mcfe basis were 31% or $2.93 lower than last year.", "Quarterly oil and gas sales, including cash settled derivatives total $248 million down 23% from the $322 million in revenues last year, reflecting that the decline in prices more than offset higher production volumes. Cash flow for the first quarter \u201809 was $158 million, 34% below the first quarter \u201908, with cash flow per share for the quarter coming in at $1.01, $0.04 above the analyst consensus estimate of $0.97.", "Quarterly EBITDAX of $185 million was 30% lower than the first quarter \u201808. First quarter cash margins were down 41% from last year at $4.25 per mcfe compared to $7.15 per mcfe in 2008. Cash margins received a bit of a boost from a $0.08 per mcfe reduction in cash unit costs from the first quarter of last year, but margins still suffered from lower oil and gas prices.", "Thanks to the peculiarities of mark-to-market hedge accounting despite a 31% drop in oil and gas prices, booked net income actually increased almost 2,000% from $2 million in the first quarter \u201808 to $33 million in \u201809. Due to $138 million non-cash mark-to-market hedging loss in last year\u2019s number, versus a $31 million non-cash mark-to-market hedging gain in 2009.", "Quarterly earnings calculated using analyst consensus methodology for the first quarter these years were $38 million, or $0.24 per fully diluted share. That compares to an analyst consensus estimate of $0.21. As Rodney mentioned, the Range Resources website contains a full reconciliation of non-GAAP measures mentioned on this call, including cash flow, EBITDAX and cash margin.", "Turning to the expense categories for first quarter \u201809 we see that the trend toward lower cost first visible at range in the mid 2008 has continued. Looking back for a moment, cash, direct operating expense unit cost, including work-overs was $0.96 in the first quarter of last year and it peaked at $1.05 per mcfe in the second quarter \u201808. Since then, we have seen this cost decline to $1 in the third quarter of \u201908 and $0.94 in the fourth quarter last year.", "As John mentioned, cash direct unit operating costs were $0.93 in the first quarter \u201809, and we expect it to stay in the low $0.90 range next year, or the range of this year. As one would expect, with lower oil and gas prices, production and ad valorem taxes for mcfe were 46% lower than last year\u2019s first quarter, production taxes total $0.22 per mcfe for the first quarter of \u201909 compared to $0.41 last year.", "G&A expense adjusted for non-cash stock compensation was $0.50 per mcfe for the first quarter \u201809. That\u2019s down $0.03 sequentially from the fourth quarter of \u201808, but up $0.12 from the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect cash G&A expense to increase in\u201909 as we position our Marcellus Shale team to deliver meaningful future growth.", "Cash G&A expense, unit cost is anticipated to be in the $0.55 to $0.59 range per mcfe for the rest of \u201809. Interest expense for the first quarter of \u201809 was $0.71 per Mcfe. That\u2019s $0.02 higher than the first quarter last year and $0.03 less than the first quarter fourth quarter. Exploration expenses for the first quarter of \u201909 excluding non-cash stock comp expense was $12.3 million $3.2 million lower than first quarter of last year, mostly due to lower dry hole costs.", "We anticipate that quarterly ex exploration expense, including non-cash compensation will approximate $15 million to $18 million per quarter the rest of the year depending, of course, on our drilling success and the timing of seismic purchases. Depletion, depreciation and amortization per mcfe for the first quarter of \u201909 was $2.25 that compares to $2.08 in the first quarter last year and of this $2.25 figure, $2.09 represents depletion expense and $0.16 is attributable to depreciation and amortization of our other assets.", "Our continuing DD&A rate should hover around the $2.25 per Mcfe mark going forward. The first quarter of \u201809 marks the second quarter we have classified our abandonment and impairment expense related to unproved properties on a separate line item in the income statement. In prior quarters, this non-cash expense was embedded in the DD&A expense line item. We\u2019ve taken a $19.6 million expense to unproved properties in the first quarter \u201809. That compares to $1.4 million in the first quarter \u201808 and $36.6 million in the fourth quarter of last year.", "Let me elaborate for a moment on how the unproved property account works. When an oil and gas lease is taken, the consideration is recorded to the unproved properties account, which acts as a holding pen for acreage awaiting exploration and development. There are three ways that dollars leave the unproved property account. One, a successful well is drilled on unproved acreage and an allocation is made transferring a portion of the unproved property amount to proved properties.", "Two, unproved acreage monetized in an outright sale or farm out to a third party; and three, the leases underlying the unproved property expire or become impaired and the carrying value is written off. Among the factors that enter into deciding, whether or not an unproved property becomes impaired are the acreage expiration date, the terms of the lease, the willingness of the mineral loner to extend or renegotiate, range\u2019s drilling results on the acreage, or even a competitor\u2019s drilling results on adjacent like kind acreage the receipt of new data such as a seismic survey, the size of the capital spending budget, the spending is budget, oil and gas prices, cost to drill, complete and operate the area and the ability to sell or farm out acreage.", "As you can see from this list of factors, almost anything that happens in our business has the potential to impact our estimate of lease abandon expense and as you know, a lot has been happening in our industry over the past few quarters. Overtime, our abandonment expense history will reflect our experience in multiple shale plays and our estimates of acreage abandonment expense should become less volatile and more predictable, but until then the expense figure will continue to vary quarter-by-quarter. Our best estimate right now on our future quarterly non-cash abandonment expense is between $16 million and $19 million.", "Range incurred $19 million in deferred taxes for the quarter, but paid no cash taxes. Our tax rate remains 37%. We\u2019ve received many inquiries recently concerning the new administration\u2019s proposal to eliminate all tax preferences for the oil and gas industry. It\u2019s too early to predict the likelihood and impact of removing the preferences as the details of the proposal are not yet nope and the legislative process is just getting started what.", "We do know at range, is that we have a $159 million NOL carry forward and approximately $600 million in capitalized intangible drilling costs that we have incurred in prior years, but have not yet expensed for tax. So regardless of what happens in Washington, these two items will continue to allow range to defer cash taxes for many years.", "For the remainder of 2009, range has 83% of its cash for gas production hedged at a floor price of $7.42 per Mmbtu. The hedges are spread across a group of 12 high quality counterparties, ten of which are lenders in the bank credit facility. We also have natural gas basis swaps extending into 2011 with a quarter end net carrying value of $5.8 million. Assuming natural gas prices behave like we anticipate we will likely begin to hedge 2010 production later this year.", "Before we leave the income statement, now that all the year end results are in for the public companies in our peer group, we\u2019re beginning to see independent research emerge that again confirms range\u2019s position as a low cost operator. The 2008 annual E and P break even cost report published by Banc of America Securities reveals that range again has the second lowest break even price of the 32 companies in the B of A high yield peer group. This marks the 5th consecutive year in which range placed either first or second in their report.", "Now looking at the balance sheet for a minute, there are a couple of items I wish to mention. First, on March 31, the range bank group reaffirmed the existing $1.5 billion borrowing base through October of 2009. No changes to the structure or interest rate were required with the reaffirmation. ", "We have belief that our total volume capacity remains well in excess of our current $1.5 billion borrowing base. We have pressure tested the volume base at various prices and believe that even in a continued low price environment, we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs.", "Second, measures will note bank debt increased by $114 million during the quarter, reflecting front loading of some of the capital spending program, particularly targeted Marcellus acreage purchases that John and Jeff will talk about more in a minute. Also, while we have gone from running 33 rigs last year at this time to 15 rigs this year, it takes several months after a rig is dropped before all the invoices from that rig work through the normal working cycle.", "So we expect to bring bank debt back down later in the year, as capital spending reductions take hold and asset sales occur. Even with the slight increase in debt this quarter, our debt-to-cap ratio was 43% at the end of first quarter, compared to 47% at the end of the first quarter last year.", "In summary, the first quarter of 2009 marks a very solid operating performance with a double-digit increase in production a company by lower unit operating cost. The quarter is also noteworthy for some of the things that we did not experience, such as significant reserve write-downs, infrastructure delays, or poor drilling results. ", "As John mentioned, everything at range is on track and proceeding according to plan. The lower oil and gas prices have halted strength of record financial results. Range continues to deliver on our core mission. Steady reserve and production growth at low cost.", "John, turn it back to you.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Roger. With that I will turn it over to Jeff to review our exploration and development activities. Jeff.", "Jeff Ventura", "Thanks, John. I\u2019ll begin by reviewing production. For the first quarter production averaged $416 million per day, 12% increase over the first quarter of 2008. This represents the highest quarterly production rate in the company eat history and the 25 consecutive quarter of sequential production growth.", " Let\u2019s now review our three key project. First, I\u2019ll start with the Marcellus Shale, Appalachian Basin. With first gas process plant, which is a refrigeration plant came online last October and the capacity of that plant is 30 million per day.", "The second gas processing plant the cryogenic plant came online in early April, which adds 30 million per day capacity. By the end of September, an additional 20 million per day of refrigeration capacity will be added and in early 2010, a 120 million per day cryo plant will start up. In total, we anticipate having 200 million per day of processing capacity by early next year.", "Range exited 2008 producing roughly 30 million cubic feet equivalent per day net from the Marcellus Shale and had three rigs drilling. Range is on track to exit 2009 with Marcellus production at 80 million to 100 million per net. We plan on accomplishing this by entering 2009 with three drilling rigs and exiting the year with a total of six drilling rigs. The fact that we believe we reach 80 million to 100 million per day net by running so few rigs, speaks to the excellent quality of the wells that we are drilling in anticipate drilling this year.", "Although, it\u2019s very early we\u2019re working on plans for 2010. These plans are preliminary and will be a function of future gas prices, cash flow, well performance, board approval etc., but given all of the above, our early estimate is that we\u2019ll probably exit 2010 at double our 2009 exit rate. Two of the three rigs we have drilling in the Marcellus, are a new custom designed rigs. By year end, all six rigs will be specifically designed for our applications.", "Even though we just began drilling with the new rigs, these rigs are already exceeding expectations. Typical time to move one of the old rigs between wells on the same pad was two days. Now we can move it in four hours or less expect that our team will continue to make significant headwind improving performance. ", "We believe the Marcellus Shale has excellent economics. We currently are estimating average reserves per well to be 3 to 4 bcfe in the areas where we\u2019re drilling and the cost to drill and complete in a development mode to be 3 million to 4 million per well.", "Assuming the midpoint of both ranges in a $7 per NYMEX gas price, the rate of return is 75% and the F and D is $1.16 per mcfe. At $5 per mcf, NYMEX flat for the life of the well, the rate of return is 46%. Assuming the same reserves in cost, NYMEX could drop three and quarter per mcf and these wells would still have 20% rate of return. Our acreage position is nearly 900,000 net acres. The 900,000 net acreage equates to more than 15 to 22 Tcfe of net on risk resource potential.", "Of that, 10 tcfe to 15 tcfe are located in the southwest part of the play with the remainder in the northeast. We currently have the record for the highest rate vertical well, which is in the northeast and tested for 24 hours at a rate of 6.3 million per day.", "Range also holds the record for the highest rate horizontal well in the play too which is 24.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day in the southwest part of the play. The 24.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day well actually cleaned up some after we reported it and its best rate 24 hour rate to sales was 26 million per day.", "For the best 30 days to sales this will average 10.8 million per day. Our next best three wells produced two sales at rates of 10.3 million, 10.1 and 9.1 cubic feet equivalent per day for their best 24 hour rates. For the best 30 days, the averaged 4.3, 7.2 and 7.6 million cube it feet per day.", "The well that we announced in our press release yesterday that was testing at $10.7 million per day continues to clean up and it look likes like its peak 24 hour rate will be 13.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day at a flowing tubing pressure of 1250 pounds. In addition in yesterday\u2019s release we drilled and completed another Marcellus well for 7.9 million cubic feet equivalent per day.", "In addition to pursuing the Marcellus Shale we\u2019re starting the Utica, Berquette, Middlesex, Genesee and Rinestreet shales. There\u2019s good potential for all these horizons on our existing acreage in the Appalachian basin. The perspective areas of these unexploited shales targets largely occur within Range\u2019s core Marcellus acreage positions thus allowing for stack pay opportunities and operational efficiencies in resource development.", "Range owns a total of 2.7 million gross acres or 2.3 million net acres of leasehold in the Appalachian basin. Another very impactful low risk project for us in the Appalachian basin is our Nora area in Virginia. There\u2019s significant upside to all three horizons in Nora, CBM, tight gas sands and the Huron Shale. Range continues to drill successful CMB and tight gas sand wells in this field and has over 2,150 producing wells here.", "F&D costs net to Range continue to be around $1 per mcf which is among the lowest in the country. In addition, these wells produce very little water and have low lifting cost. Given its location in the Appalachian basin these wells also receive a premium to NYMEX. The combination of low F&D and low LOE results in a very good rate of return of about 60% at a $7 per mcf NYMEX gas price.", "At $5 the rate of return is 33%. Given the large number of wells which can be drilled in current spacing and assuming successful down spacing there are approximately 6,000 wells left to drill. The latest development in Nora is horizontal drilling in the Huron shale. So far we\u2019ve drilled and completed nine wells. Of these eight wells have been turned on and have initial 24 hour rates of 1.1 million per day two sales, which is very good.", "The remaining two wells will be turned to sales soon. Rinestreet shales have potential of about 1.5 tcf of net gas reserves to range. The next idea we\u2019re testing is horizontal drilling in the Berea sandstone which we believe has excellent potential on our acreage. Our first two wells were successful and came on line at rates of 1.5 million and 1.1 million per day. We\u2019ll be drilling 18 additional horizontal wells during the remainder of the year 13 in the Heron and five in the Berea.", "The next project I want to discuss is the Barnett shale in the Fort Worth basin. Range currently has about 96,000 net acres in the Barnett shale play. This represents 1.6 tcfe of net un-risk un-book upside in the core proven part of the Barnett. Currently we have three rigs running in the Barnett. Although we\u2019re running fewer rigs this year results have been spectacular. Range just set a record for the highest rate well in the Barnett to date by any operator.", "Our well produced an average of 9.6 million per day for 30 days. I would also like to point out that after thousands of Barnett wells have been drilled and completed, 9.6 million per day is the best. An interesting comparison, after drilling and completing only 35 Marcellus Shale wells our best well averaged 10.8 million per day for 30 days to sales, which is better than the record Barnett well.", "Even though we\u2019re only running three rigs in the Barnett production continue decline we\u2019re currently producing about 125 million per day net from the play. On our core Barnett acreage are wells for average about 3 bcf and cost about 2.6 million. At $7", "NYMEX this generates close to a 70% rate of return. At $5 flat gas for the life of the well the rate of return is 32%.", "Let me address the cost savings that we\u2019re seeing. In the Barnett rig rates for range one year ago averaged about 20,700 per day. In May we\u2019re projecting rig rates to average about 12,500 per day, which is decrease of 40%. By July we\u2019re projecting our average rate will be about 10,000 per day.", "Stimulation costs have also dropped 30% over this period. Tubular prices are also coming down, for example, I\u2019ll use [inaudible]. In July of 2008 prices had significantly increased and we were paying 26.40 per foot. For July of 2009, we\u2019re projecting 14.50 per foot.", "In the Marcellus, we are also seeing significant cost reductions both from decreasing service cost and our own efficiencies. Rig rates are down in the Marcellus, but not near to the degree in the Barnett, since the pace of drilling is actually increasing in the Marcellus versus declining in the Barnett.", "Frac costs are down significantly, though. We\u2019ve seen a 44% reduction in costs there for the same job size. We\u2019re also seeing considerable cost savings from efficiency improvements with the new custom rigs, new bits, reengineered mud systems, slider, new directional drilling companies, turnkey moves and improved completion designs.", "We\u2019re projecting our development wells for the second quarter of this year to reach $3.5 million to drill and complete. Going forward, Range will be able to do more with less. Our efficiency will improve not only from reduced costs, but from the high graded portfolio that we now have.", "Even though Range has done a great job of growing production with top of the class all in cost structure over the last five years, it will be even better going forward. Range\u2019s growth three to five years ago came from properties like Fuhrman, Conger, Eunice, course in the Range and complementary acquisitions.", "Going forward, our growth primarily will come from the Marcellus and Nora in the core area of the Barnett. These are all relatively new editions to our portfolio and they all have significantly better economics and the ability to grow producing rates significantly better than the properties that were driving our growth previously.", "I mentioned the rates of return of these projects earlier and they\u2019re all very robust, even with low commodity prices. They\u2019re among the best rate of return and lowest F&D costs projects in the U.S. I believe that the Marcellus is the best project in the country, particularly when you couple that with the large reserve up side that it has.", "The F&D costs for the all three properties ranges from about $1 to $1.50 and LOEs from all three are low. It\u2019s also important that two of our top three projects are in the Appalachian basin with the gas prices better than anywhere else in the U.S. Approximately 90% of our budget will be spent in these three areas.", "This portfolio has resulted in Range consistently delivering top tier organic production and reserve growth with one of the lowest cost structures in the business. As Roger mentioned, according to BFAs research, considering all in costs, which includes F&D, LOE, G&A, interest expense and basin gas price differentials.", "Range has either the lowest or second lowest cost structure of the group of companies that they cover for the last five years in a row. This is a direct result of our simple strategy of strong organic growth, a top quartile cost structure or better, and in addition consistently building and highgrading our inventory, coupled with one of the best teams in the industry. ", "Range today has more potential upside and lower risk upside than at any time in the company\u2019s history. With our inventory, today we have the opportunity to grow the company more than tenfold, primarily from the Marcellus Shale, Nora, and the Barnett Shale. We believe our excellent organic growth, coupled with an excellent cost structure will result in continuing to create strong shareholder returns overtime, back to you John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Jeff. That was terrific update in terms of what\u2019s going on in the field. Let\u2019s look forward a little bit. Looking to the remainder of 2009, we see continued strong operating results. For the second quarter of 2009 we\u2019re looking for production to average 420 million to 425 million a day. This midpoint represents an 11% increase year-over-year.", "I should note that the second quarter production guidance assumes we sell Fuhrman, the Fuhrman-Mascho Field midway in the second quarter. Fuhrman is currently producing approximately 16 million a day net. We\u2019re in the process of finalizing the Fuhrman purchase and sale agreement and should be able to provide more of the details very shortly.", "Looking beyond the second quarter, it gets a little fuzzy due to the impact of the asset sales. Besides Fuhrman, we have a couple of smaller properties that we\u2019re in discussion with potential buyers. All that being said, with the momentum from the existing drilling results that Jeff talked about, we\u2019ve had so far this year, we currently believe that we\u2019ll achieve our 10% production growth target for the year even after taking into account the asset sales that we had in progress.", "Given the reduced capital program, as Jeff mentioned, we\u2019re focusing 9% of our CapEx in the Marcellus, Nora and Barnett plays. These plays generate very attractive returns even at low gas prices. We\u2019re fortunate that our remaining properties have a very shallow decline curve.", "In particular, our tight gas sand properties in Appalachia, for example are all in a decline of less than 10%. As Jeff mentioned, one of the key elements this year will be the very positive impact on our results relate to capital efficiency. In the past few years, we spent considerable capital in the Marcellus play without seeing any visible return.", "Beginning the October of last year this all changed as the first phase of the infrastructure was completed and the production began to ramp up. As our Marcellus production continues to ramp up in 2009, we see this capital efficiency impact having an ever increasing impact. As we like to say, this will allow us to do more with less.", "In the latter half of 2009 and to 2010, this will be even more evident as we get more capital efficiency impact from the Marcellus ramping up, as well as the full benefit of lower service costs. As it relates to our 2009 capital program, Roger discussed that we expended a disproportionate share of our CapEx in the first quarter.", "This was our plan, as we had some key acreage in the Marcellus and to a lesser extent the Barnett that we wanted to tie up. With that completed, the benefit of the lower service cost and a fewer rigs running, the rate of capital spending will decline throughout the remainder of the year.", "Looking to capital spending for 2009 and 2010 and how we plan to fund it, a key component was our commitment to asset sales. With the capital efficiency that we\u2019re generating from the Marcellus, Nora an the Barnett, we have a number of other properties that had development potential which will not likely see a lot of CapEx allocated to them. ", "Three years ago we made the decision to begin methodical process of selling off such properties like Fuhrman that had plenty of development opportunities, but where we saw that we weren\u2019t likely to allocate sufficient capital to develop them, given the higher and better use of the capital at the other projects.", "Besides providing capital to cycle into the high return projects, we believe this will continue to result in lowering our cost structure and it will focus our technical teams on high return projects and will ultimately result in issuing less equity. As I\u2019ve said many times in the past, at Range we care a lot about our stock price, but not much about our market capitalization.", "We are confident that when we combine our cash flow with the asset sales that we have in process, we will have sufficient capital to execute our capital program for the remainder of 2009 and through 2010, while maintain a strong balance sheet. We anticipate that the majority of the asset sales will be completed in the second quarter. As a result, this will allow us to be patient, disciplined as we look to hedge our 2010 production later this year.", "One item, I have not mentioned as a source of CapEx funding is the issuance of equity. Over the years, our strategy has been to issue equity only when we\u2019ve had a clear use of the proceeds. This reflects our belief that if we maintain a disciplined approach towards issuing equity, we have a much better chance of driving up our stock price overtime.", "Recently, we\u2019ve had several investors and/or analysts suggest that Range will break ranks with this strategy and issue equity because, quote, we have an attractive stock price. I believe strongly the best way to increase our stock price is A, execute our business plan, which we\u2019re doing and B, not issue equity unless we have a clear use of proceeds. ", "Because our asset sales are proceeding as planned, our drilling results generating terrific results, our costs are coming down and we have minimal future drilling commitments. We do not see a clear use of proceeds and therefore I can say very clearly, we have no plans to issue equity at the current time.", "With regards to our valuation, we truly appreciate that our shareholders have confidence in our ability to continue to generate attractive returns. We don\u2019t get too balled up in comparing our valuation to that of our other companies. Obviously, we have a much more intimate understanding of Range\u2019s value and it\u2019s potential. ", "Based on this understanding, we believe that our NAV per share is substantially higher than our current stock price. As we continue to execute our plan, this will become clearer to everyone. The bottom line is, if the Marcellus continues to drill out in the wells of average 3 to 4 Bcf each and they cost $3 million to 4 million to drill and complete. Range is clearly a triple digit stock.", "It\u2019s our job to execute and make this real for our existing shareholders. That being said, at Range there are multiple ways to win. We have a substantial potential as Jeff, discussed in both Nora and the Barnett and many of our other properties that can more than double and triple our proved reserves.", "Although, extremely important, we\u2019re not betting the ranch on the Marcellus. I should also mention there are other horizons besides the Marcellus and Appalachia, it could provide plenty of additional potential and as Jeff mentioned as well.", "In summary looking at Range today, we have the largest drilling inventory in our history with over 10,000 projects. Our inventory together with our emerging plays represents 20 to 28 Tcf of future growth potential. This equal seven to ten times our existing proved reserves. While we are excited about the growth potential of Range, we are intently focused on delivering each and every quarter. The first quarter 2009 is a sign example of this commitment, by all the employees at Range.", "With that, operator, let\u2019s open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "(Operator Instructions) your first question comes from Jeff Hayden - Rodman & Renshaw.", "Jeff Hayden - Rodman & Renshaw", "Couple of quick questions, just curious about the, your Marcellus acreage position, you guys have kind of assumed about 900,000 for awhile, yet you\u2019ve continued to add some acreage. Just curious has there been some acreage you\u2019ve been weighing out of the core fairway as you continue to add or are you kind of staying conservative with the 900, we should really think entire than that?", "John Pinkerton ", "We obviously, just to step back and we own 1.4 million net acres in the outline of the Marcellus, as you\u2019ve pointed out,  we\u2019ve kind of, quote, high graded about 900,000 of that. We continue to add acreage. There\u2019s some of the acreage in there, especially in the areas where we haven\u2019t high graded part of the 500,000, so to speak. That\u2019s expiring and/or we\u2019re letting go or we\u2019re selling to third parties or farming out to other operators. ", "All that being said, not trying to decoy, the 900,000 is still around the 900,000. In terms of all that and again, I don\u2019t think we ought to be focused on whether it\u2019s 925 or 875 or 880, quite frankly. I think the key is that continued to drive up production along what we\u2019re doing.", "The acreage we\u2019re buying and I want to stress this, the acreage we\u2019re buying; as we\u2019re not buying any trend acreage in the play. We haven\u2019t really done that, even last year we weren\u2019t doing that. The acreage we\u2019re buying or leasing or farming in is in and around these good wells that Jeff mentioned.", "We\u2019re filling in all those holes; we\u2019re trying to fill in the holes. The only problem is there\u2019s a lot of holes and they\u2019re pretty big. So, it\u2019s a lot of opportunity, but we\u2019re going to be disciplined as we go through that, but the good news is, obviously, acreage price is coming down. We\u2019re getting it a fair amount cheaper.", "Jeff Ventura", "Let me just add to that a little bit, when we talk about the roughly 900,000 about 550,000 was in the Southwest, 350,000 in the Northeast. We have big positions in both areas. The other thing that\u2019s interesting at this point in time with all the activity we\u2019ve had, which is a large number of wells coupled with excellent results from Chesapeake and CNX and Atlas and Equitable, a lot of the risk has been taken out of that piece of the acreage. ", "Now, that\u2019s a lot of reserves to Range. So, I feel good so far really a lot of the wells in that area, basically they\u2019re all good. So, that\u2019s exciting and just in terms of what\u2019s been both de-risked of course you\u2019d like to see a 1000 wells there and 10,000 wells and in time I think you\u2019ll see that, but the risk clearly is coming down and the potential of the wells looks excellent.", "Jeff Hayden - Rodman & Renshaw", "Just one other real quick one, on the two recent wells you guys reported, can you give us any color on lateral length, number of frac stages, etc that you use on those?", "John Pinkerton", "Yes, I mean, so far we\u2019ve not given out real specifics. We have set in general; the designs are similar to what you see in the Barnett, in terms of lateral length in number of stages, but for a little while longer I think we\u2019ll hold on to that.", "We\u2019re still trying to work and optimize that and the guys are doing an excellent job. Obviously, we\u2019re drilling some great wells not with just great IP, but wells that hang in there 30 days, 60 days. Our oldest horizontal well has been online and really almost two years. When we plot those wells versus the Barnett wells and we\u2019re active in the Barnett, of course active in the Marcellus, they plot very favorably. So, real excited with what we have in and where we\u2019re at this point in time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets.", "Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets ", "Jeff, on again going back to last few wells, any thoughts as to the variability in the 30 day performance? Some of them are holding up much better than the others.", "Jeff Ventura", "When you look at any wells and it\u2019s easy to pick the more mature shale plays like the Barnett. When you look within Tarrant County, which is the best part of the Barnett, you see variability in the wells. That\u2019s true in Fayetteville, its true in the Woodford, its truly conventional plays, it\u2019s truly onshore and offshore, it\u2019s similar.", "All in all, I\u2019m very excited. I would like to say, when you look at that area and I haven\u2019t counted the wells recently, but between CNX and Atlas and Chesapeake, and Range and Equitable and others, there\u2019s got to be over 250 wells down in the Southwest and that\u2019s across the large area.", "I haven\u2019t measured it recently, but I\u2019ll bet some of our wells are as far as 40 miles apart, which is pretty far and we\u2019re seeing good results across that kind of position. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m excited about it.", "Northeast is going to be great well. I complimented one of my bother from Cabot who used to work with Tenneco. They are doing a great job up there. The Northeast is going to have some good areas.", "We\u2019ve got 350,000 acres up there. We\u2019ve drilled some good wells like Tuolumne County. So, there\u2019s going to be winners and losers in the play, good area and bad areas, but clearly all of those companies that I mentioned have drilled number of excellent wells.", "Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets ", "", "Maybe I\u2019m not ready to share it yet, so I\u2019ll give you an easy out there, but what will it take to give keeping in mind the results that you have? What will it take to go revisit the three$3 million to $4 million and 3 to 4 Bcf that seems conservative enough at this point?", "Jeff Ventura", "I\u2019m glad you asked that, Rehan, a lot of people ask that, there is been, you\u2019ve announced and I just went through some of our top wells and how they\u2019ve performed initially 30 days and our oldest well like I said two, years. Clearly when I\u2019m talking about wells like that they\u2019re much better than that. Those wells are going to be 5 to 10 Bcf. They\u2019re excellent wells.", "I\u2019m comfortable right now, when we talk about 550,000 acres, that\u2019s a huge position, when we talk about 900,000 acres, that\u2019s massive. Again, I\u2019d just come back and lot of  people challenge me on that and challenges our team, but I\u2019d come back and I\u2019ll argue if we can hit the midpoint of that range, $3.5 million for 3.5 B\u2019s, signing cost or buck 16. Now, they work down to $3 a gas, I\u2019ll do that all day long.", "I think long run on gas it\u2019s going to be $6 to $8 in mcf. I don\u2019t know if any other play in the U.S. that\u2019s better than that. That has that kind of scale and magnitude and repeatability and maybe there is another one out there, but I\u2019m not aware what it is. When you couple those results with the fact that we\u2019re in the Appalachian basin, we are getting the premiums to NYMEX and the lot of royalties that we have, it\u2019s hard to beat those economics.", "Could they better? Absolutely, some of these high-end wells I\u2019m talking about, they are much better than 3 to 4 Bcf. I\u2019m not saying that those wells are B\u2019s. I\u2019m just saying when you think in terms of broad acreage positions I think that\u2019s a reasonable number based on what I see, maybe it\u2019s better, who knows, time will tell.", "Again I\u2019d come back to, if you look at the best part of the Barnett, Tarrant County, the wells I think average 3 to 3.5 days probably 3.2 on average. So I\u2019m really excited by where we are, but I understand when you are trying to go. I just think it\u2019s early, it could happen, though.", "Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets ", "So you need what, another year before you revisit or?", "Jeff Ventura", "Well, we look at it all the time, but I think I\u2019d like to see a large sample more wells, more history before we\u2019re going to move off that. At a minimum, we\u2019re probably going to stick with what we\u2019re at least through the end of the year.", "So, probably end of the year, early next year when we finish year end reserves, we\u2019ll probably revisit what we think the averages are and as we drill more wells and other people drill more wells that helps, prove up parts of the play or disapprove parts of the play and we\u2019ll get more specific.", "Hopefully in time, I know everybody wants those details. We try to give out a little more every time, but it\u2019s still a very competitive play. Its one of the few places in the U.S. where people or rig count increasing rather than dropping. So that\u2019s the reason.", "Again, the state of Pennsylvania, there\u2019s an advantage and I appreciate that the state has it, that you can keep the production information confidential for five years. That\u2019s why one of the reasons, we were willing to risk a lot of money. So that\u2019s the competitive advantage, we have, not only do we have a large acreage position, but we have more data than really anybody else out there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company.", "Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company ", "In the past you have characterized the infrastructure situation in Northeast Marcellus area as more challenging. Can you walk us through those challenges and the progress you are making to overcome them and perhaps the future development timing in the area as well?", "John Pinkerton", "Well, yes, it\u2019s good to put it in perspective. If you think about the how Pennsylvania in particular has been drilled out, a lot of the shallow drilling has taken place in the Southwest part of the state. So, that is where the greatest amount of pipelines and gathering systems and all that kind of stuff is. ", "So, even though, in some respects those lines are not capable big, high pressure wells and a big development. They do provide a good by to test wells and it\u2019s kind of a starter kit to get started. Also that the, right of ways are already defined and you can go in there and just dig another ditch and throw the pipe in there and on down the road.", "Then some of the biggest pipelines in the U.S. run right through that part of the state. So, when you take all of that, that\u2019s the reason why we said that. When you look to the Northeast, the other thing is, people are just more used to oil and gas drilling in the Southwest than they are in the Northeast.", "There tends to be, a more forest lands and more state lands up there, but all that being said, we\u2019re working on some infrastructure from the Northeast as we speak. Cabot\u2019s done a good job of getting their wells tied in and we\u2019re not. So, like I\u2019ve said all along, I think one of the misconceptions about the Marcellus play is a quote.", "The infrastructure is going to take longer. I tend to disagree with that. When you think about infrastructure again, some of the biggest pipelines in the U.S. run right in the middle of this and so it\u2019s really a midstream issue, just tying in the midstream and you\u2019ve got huge take away capacity on those big pieces of pipe that flow to the Northeast.", "Much greater, multiples greater than we started out in the Barnett and when these other places started out. So, again it\u2019s just degrees of, we\u2019re just talking about degrees there. I think in time all of it has a good way. As Jeff mentioned, you\u2019re in one of the best gas markets in the world. I\u2019ve said more than once two thirds of the people in the United States live within 350 miles around the city of Pittsburgh. So, if you have natural gas, that\u2019s where you want to sell it.", "Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company ", "Given what you said, the proximity to major pipelines, it appears that the processing bottled, the natural gas processing it appears to be kind of the chief bottleneck in the area. Are you focusing your drilling on dry gas areas to circumvent that bottleneck?", "Jeff Ventura", "Tom, I\u2019d just point out, anything in the Northeast there is going to be dry, it doesn\u2019t need to be processed. Even you go to the Southwest; the whole area doesn\u2019t need to be processed. It\u2019s just as you get off to the Western side of it. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of acreage that\u2019s in both areas.", "So, we\u2019ll be drilling in the wet gas. So, we\u2019ll have Barnett really the end of this year, early next year 200 million a day of take-away capacity. We are talking about exit rate for 2010 being double, what we end this year. So, we\u2019ll be in the capacity even if it were wet gas only, it\u2019s going to be double what we need. So, we going to be built a year ahead of time, but we\u2019ll also be working on take away.", "We have take away capacity in some of the dry areas in the southwest and by the end of next year we\u2019ll have take away capacity in the northeast. We ramped up in the southwest first, one because we like the area a lot as where we\u2019ve start, and two to we had success really almost from day one with our original rinse well there and we can ramp up quicker for the reason John said, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing. ", "We\u2019ll continue to ramp up in the southwest, but we\u2019ll start drilling in the northeast as well and by the end of 2010, we\u2019ll have production from both areas.", "John Pinkerton", "There is some advantages and disadvantages of wet gas. One, the disadvantage you\u2019ve got a processes it, but that in time solves itself because you build a gas processing plant just like we did. The good news though is that because you get very high BTU gas, the economics are better and so it\u2019s the chicken or the egg, but we think overtime those will kind of solve themselves when you\u2019re going done the road.", "Roger Manny", "I\u2019d add, even after processing in the wet gas area. The gas that we sell is still about roughly 1150 BCU and we get paid for the BCU, so you take NYMEX times 1.15, 15% up lift, which is very significant and then add the basin differential to that so.", "John Pinkerton", "Plus you get to share of the liquid that you get from the plant. So, there is a lot of benefit there when you\u2019re running through your economics and you calculate the bottom line economics. All that stuff needs to be taken into account. The one thing, I\u2019d also like to say is that, again I\u2019ll compliment our friends over northwest is that in joint venture of them, I\u2019ll give them all the credit, we\u2019ve built the first large scale gas processing plant ever in the state of Pennsylvania.", "We\u2019ve been able to do it in lightning speed, so I really compliment them. It also goes to the testament, the people they want us there. The regulators, they want it done right, which we believe it. They got a after it, the permits were given in a reasonable amount of time and we got after it may have happen. ", "Again, basically March of last year and six months later having that gas flowing is really wasn\u2019t incredible feed. I don\u2019t look at that as a bottleneck as much as I really think we did it in lightning speed, so to speak.", "Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company ", "One last quick question here with regard to the Nora well. Did you do anything different to that well to achieve that record, right and\u2026?", "John Pinkerton", "I think, one again I\u2019ll complement Jerry Grantham and his team, they are the once that force and Steve Gross looks over in that division, but or guys in general ranges, we have good partnership with [Inaudible] they worked on the CBM or work in the tied gasoline in the Shale and of course they operate it once we drilled and completed.", "Our guys have done a really good job, by targeting specific areas and completely the wells a little bit different, so it\u2019s a combination. When you get a well that good, and remember that wells are about 3400 feet deeper feet roughly, those kinds of Raven cliff wells can range from 3,000 to 4,000 feet deep.", "When you find wells like that, that average over $3 million a day for 30 days to sales we get excellent economics quick pay out, so Jerry and his team have drilled a number of great wells down. We talk about CBM lot that those tight gas sand wells are great down there. Obviously, that one is not too tight because it\u2019s doing pretty good.", "Tom Gardner - Simmons & Company ", "Can it be a horizontal development there? Is that a possibility?", "John Pinkerton", "What you have is, you have and I\u2019m trying to describe this. It would be easier if I could draw it for you. You have the CBM on top and then the traditional big horizon is Berea, and Berea we\u2019re looking at horizontal drilling because it covers more areas, but in between the tight gasoline and Berea, so in between about 2800 feet and 5,000 feet, we have a number of other horizons, like the Raven\u2019s Cliff and Big Lime and there is other formations.", "The Raven\u2019s Cliff tends to be channel that runs through there. So, as we continue to drill our infield drill, we\u2019ve encountered a good Raven\u2019s Cliff area and we\u2019re seeing some of that before. We haven\u2019t an announced those other wells that was just interesting because the original development of that field in those deeper sands and yet here we are 30, 40 years later and drilling the best wells ever out there.", "Typically, in time you think the quality if wells with get poor, these wells are actually getting better, that\u2019s said in the record, but the Raven\u2019s Cliff, I don\u2019t think a good horizontal target, its been a long answer to your question, but the Berea, I think is the Big Lime is and there is a number of other horizons there that I think will be.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ron Mills - Johnson Rice.", "Ron Mills - Johnson Rice", "Jeff, I think you started to touch on this activity in northeast Pennsylvania versus southwest Pennsylvania. It sounds like you\u2019ll be wrapping up probably in the northeast Pennsylvania towards the end of the year. How do you look at your 60 plus rigs or wells that you plan to drill this year in terms of southwest versus the northeast part of the state?", "Jeff Ventura", "For this year they are all predominantly going to be in the southwest and it\u2019s really early. Next year, though you\u2019ll see significant drilling in the northeast and if we look carefully at the development plan that we want to ramp up production in order to get a good return on our investment, generate value for our shareholders and when you look at the length of the leases and the timing, getting in our market and where we started. All those things are parts of the decision that cause us to time drilling in one area versus another. ", "But you\u2019ll see as drilling up in the northeast next year, like said really are best vertical well to-date, it\u2019s up there. So, the wells we\u2019re drilling on the southwest, I\u2019m excited about the potential in the northeast there are a number of good wells up there. So, I think we\u2019ve got 350,000 acres so that\u2019s a big. If you just think of our position in the northeast, that\u2019s pretty big position.", "Ron Mills - Johnson Rice", "Given the fact you have pretty nice interstate pipelines in that area, you mentioned it\u2019s really just matter of gathering lines, but is that the biggest issue in northeast PA?", "Jeff Ventura", "Yes and it\u2019s just timing and laying out our development. Gas there is going to be drives roughly 1000 BCU. So, but the guys are in the process of acquiring the firm transportation. We already have [PEP\u2019s] and we\u2019ve got plans for gathering and we know exactly everyone start drilling. So, we\u2019ve got a good plan in place. I\u2019m excited about that, this year should be really exciting, and next year should be even more exciting.", "Ron Mills - Johnson Rice", "Roger, for you just from a hedging standpoint. I think you would mention earlier that as you look towards the latter part of this year, you probably look to start layering in 2010 hedges. What are some of the trigger points that you\u2019re looking for from a hedging strategy standpoint for next year?", "John Pinkerton", "Ron this is John. My thesis and I\u2019ll make this clear; we\u2019re not hedging $3 of gas. To me it\u2019s pretty simple. We took six and a half years to increase the rig count, natural gas rig count of about 750 rigs to over 1600 rigs and it\u2019s taken us seven months to eliminate that, plus go below that.", "It\u2019s just going to be a matter of time until you see the supply response and I think when that happens, I think gas, natural gas prices are going to respond very violently and once that occurs, then we\u2019ll take advantage of it and get our hedging done. So, that\u2019s kind of the theory and quite frankly, we do have some specific numbers and thoughts in mind, but we\u2019ll keep those to ourselves a little bit. ", "Ron, I think you can go back. Again, not trying to, but you can go back and look at what we\u2019ve done historically. It\u2019s not going to be too much different from that.", "Ron Mills - Johnson Rice", "I tend to agree with you in terms of the gas price scenario, especially as we get to the latter part of this year. I just didn\u2019t know if you were going to have. In the past there was someone to protect a certain amount of activity levels, just as you start looking at 2010 versus 2009, especially as northeast Pennsylvania starts to ramp up. I would assume that the outlook would be continue to ramp up your CapEx in 2010 relative to this year, at least focus on the drilling portion of it?", "John Pinkerton", "Well that\u2019s a good point. Let me kind of is zero in on that, because I think you said a couple things that we need to clarify and get some clarity and to be completely transparent. As I mentioned, we are in the process of getting these asset sales, Chad Stephens and his team have done a traffic job, are in the process of getting these asset sales signed up and again, pretty soon we\u2019ll give you some clarity on at least Furman and then the little ones we\u2019ll probably talk about next quarter. ", "That is the thesis, at least in our view, that between our existing cash flow and those asset sales. We believe confidently that will generate the cash flow to generate all the capital we need for \u201809 and 2010 based on current prices; and so we feel pretty confident there.", "In terms of the comment in terms of capital, again the thing I think we don\u2019t plan on ramping up capital in 2010. We don\u2019t need to because the capital efficiency between service prices coming down and capital efficiency that Jeff talked about and the productivity we\u2019re getting out of our big three projects, we\u2019re not to need to ramp up capital \u201810 over 2009 much, again to get very solid growth and hit our business plan and continue to double the production, the actual rate in the Marcellus.", "So I want to be clear there, we\u2019re not expecting a big ramp up in capital in 2010. Obviously, if prices respond -- we\u2019re actually probably a little conservative than some, but if prices do respond higher than what we think. I mean could I see as increasing capital marginally, but not a whole lot. ", "Again, I think the key like Jeff said the thing that\u2019s so exciting about the Marcellus is that you can get a lot of growth rolling just a few numbers of rigs and so we\u2019re pretty excited about that.", "Again it comes back to this whole capital efficiency issue. We can do more with less, because the FD&A and the well results have been so much better than what we hoped for and so, therefore this gives us more confidence that we can do more with less.", "John Pinkerton", "Let me add a little bit another example of efficiency. I was talking to the guy Ray Walker who heads up for Marcellus Shale division, right before the call and where we do a lot of pre-planning what do we want to do at first this year, next year and five and ten years out, and we were talking about it\u2019s way early when the true numbers out, but roughly speaking we are talking about it. We doubled the number of wells in the Marcellus next year and as sensitivity.", "Now that can rise how more rigs, do we need if we do that and Ray said, it depends how efficient we get. There is a chance and I\u2019m not promising, it\u2019s just antidotal, but you can see the cost really coming down. We may be able to drill double the wells with the similar number of rigs or maybe just a couple more. You don\u2019t need to double the rigs to double the number our time on the well, cost per well, speed on a well is getting so much better with the way that we\u2019re drilling.", "So, it\u2019s another efficiency I\u2019m just pointing out, I think everybody thinks in a simplistic way of one plus one is two, but it isn\u2019t if we can get better and better in terms of what we\u2019re doing.", "John Pinkerton", "Well, I think a great example by Jeff is, what Southwest has done recently in the Fayetteville in terms of some of the progress they\u2019ve made in terms of drilling efficiencies, quality of wells what not and that\u2019s again, I think it\u2019s one of the things that to me is just so encouraging, when I think of these shale plays in general in that in a traditional conventional play, as you drill the shale of well quality tends to get worse overtime after you hit kind of piece.", "There must be interesting thing in the shale plays, because there\u2019s so much gas in play as you really increase repeatability I mean, the repetitiveness you learnt and learnt and learn. You are always learned. Even in the Barnes, some of the last few wells in Barnes that we did so well on, we\u2019re learning stuff from those that we\u2019re applying even today.", "So again, I think when we say we got to make the Marcellus real, that\u2019s part of this whole process that we\u2019re. We see this every day and that\u2019s why, again we\u2019re pretty confident in terms of when we look at our valuation and we look at our ability to exit rates and some of the things that Jeff has put before you, it\u2019s because we\u2019re not doing it because we hope it happens real time here, and we\u2019re taking that and trying to project it forward and give you all the clearest view we can without giving you too much of the treasure map that we think is just so important to keep confidential until the appropriate time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets", "You guys commented about reducing your drilling time with some of these new fit for purpose rigs. Can you quantify that at all in terms of how long itfs going to take to drill and complete a well now in the Marcellus?", "John Pinkerton", "Like you said, I mentioned about 10 things or so that we\u2019re doing differently and we\u2019re sort of doing those all conjunction. I can talk about times per well. I think to me in more relevant statistic, as what kind of costs. I\u2019m telling you, in this quarter I think we\u2019ll get too. We will reach $3.5 million per development well.", "That\u2019s why I feel pretty good when I say we\u2019re going to spend $3.5 million to $3.5 B\u2019s. I think those are reasonable numbers because I think we\u2019ll get there on development wells in the southwest this quarter and I think for the wells we\u2019re drill so far 3.5 B\u2019s is right down the middle of the Strike Zone.", "I can talk about days on wells and what kind of bits we use and I know everybody wants to how long our laterals are and where we pump and which size mesh sand, but all I can tell you as I\u2019m comfortable that will hit those numbers that we\u2019re saying. I feel very good about the numbers that we\u2019re putting out.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets", "With respect to comment about asset sales, can you give us an order of magnitude about some of the sales after Furman, are we talking $100 million bucks, $500 million bucks. Do you have any kind of ranging you can give us about approximately how much capitals that coming from asset sales?", "John Pinkerton", "Leo, that\u2019s a good question and I appreciate you bringing that up. I want to make sure I don\u2019t give anything that might not be, just something that might be a little bit confusing. We\u2019ve got Furman producing about $16 million; you could use pretty traditional metrics and come up with a value there. The other properties are relatively small, couple of properties that are worth $15 million, $20 million, and $30 million each.", "One, those small property sales in most cases you got some smaller companies that have really very limited access to capital. So those things, you never know if they\u2019re going to close, but they\u2019re relatively small. I would think both of those together, anywhere from $20 million to $50 million probably because there\u2019s a chance we won\u2019t get them both done. Those are relatively small compared to Furman.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets", "This question about some of the other emerging sales you talked about in Appalachia, obviously there is some other horizons out there. Anything scheduled to get tested this year by you folks?", "John Pinkerton", "It most likely would be early next year when we drill those horizons, but they certainly look interesting, it\u2019s more than just a concept with the exception of the Utica. All of the other Shale\u2019s are above the Marcellus. So, as we drill through Marcellus, we\u2019re drilling through the Burkett, Genesee, Middlesex, Rinestreet intervals.", "So, we\u2019ve seen those on logs, we have show data in mark data and some cases core date that indicate that there are certain area, again sort of like the Marcellus, people wave their arms over the whole play, you\u2019ve got to be in the right spots. It\u2019s going to be like the Barnett or Fayetteville or Woodford.", "There is going to be, I think key spots you want to be and other spots you don\u2019t, but on our existing acreage the good news is we don\u2019t have to pick it up. We have very significant up side in those other horizon on our acreage and it\u2019s more than just up side like we said, we\u2019ve got a number of wells that are drilled through the intervals.", "Jeff Ventura", "To be completely transparent, we did have some of those science projects we were going to do this year, but again it just comes down to capital and allocating capital. Those are the things that quite frankly we cut and we just going to have to see higher gas prices and before we get to that.", "Again, I think that\u2019s where all the companies are doing. As the CEO as I talk to those, kind of projects in this environment, those are the first things that get whacked and those are [Inaudible] in the technical team up in Appalachia are screaming about trying to do those things, but they understand it just going to take sometime and we\u2019ll get to them eventually and hopefully we\u2019ll kick off some of those early next year and peel back that onion and see what happens.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets", "Just final question on CapEx, you guys still targeting $700 million here in 2009 and does that $700 million include the $72 million spent on acreage in the first quarter?", "Roger Manny", "Yes, our CapEx budget is $700 million and of that we had $100 million allocated to land. So we\u2019ve spent $72 million of the $100 million in the first quarter. Actually, we\u2019ve spent the first half of the first quarter, they were very efficient. So yes, we\u2019re still at $700 million and our acreage budget is still at $100 million.", "I guess a lot of our land people were playing a lot of golf this summer, but I\u2019m teasing they\u2019ll have plenty to do, but we are going to be really, really disciplined. We are going to stick to our knitting and like all of us we are going to over the next month or tow or quarter or two to see how gas prices are doing compared to the rest of the stuff.", "We\u2019re going to be disciplined, but we\u2019ll stay flexible as well. So, we\u2019ll get all the proceeds in the second quarter. So again, it\u2019s the timing of all that and feeling comfortable. We\u2019re going to stick with this $700 million and $100 million in terms of the acreage and whatnot.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Biju Perincheril - Jefferies & Company.", "Biju Perincheril - Jefferies & Company", "Good afternoon guys. John, 900,000 acres years and years of development and you hear a lot of talk about mergers and international companies want to use their exposure to Shale Plays from the U.S. Any thoughts along those lines maybe farming out or JV part of your acreage?", "John Pinkerton", "Well, when our friends in Oklahoma City did the deal with the Norwegians, obviously that got everybody, not so much of us, but it got I think a lot of the bigger companies thinking about that and we have actually entertained those calls and met with them, just like we would anything else and discussed it with them.", "We\u2019ve kind of gone through it and everything else. There are a couple of things I\u2019ll say about it. I think in general, our strategy at range and I want going to be general to be drilling and I\u2019ll comedown from 50,000 feet down a well, but I think our strategy range and we thought about this a long time, we talked amongst ourselves and ran numbers and really gave a lot of thought.", "Our theory in life is, what we want to do is own as much as our highest quality asset as we can and overtime, divest of the more mature lower quality assets to help fund that. So, if you agree with that strategy, then what our actions should be is not to do a JV, but try to take capital out of these other projects by selling assets and using the cash flow and funding it back into these projects. So, that is kind of the overall strategy ", "The other thick is, I just simply think it\u2019s too early in the play to get what I think is going to be fair value out of those joint ventures. I think obviously, the bigger guys want to get it relatively cheap and we think, given the numbers and the wells we\u2019ve drilled, we would command a much higher price, even if we wanted to do it.", "So to me, it\u2019s too early in the play to do it and the other thing is we want to focus range at getting more of the play and not less of the play. So, I think that\u2019s our strategy going forward and again the key, which is different than the other plays is and especially because of range because we were in there buying acreage $50 million to $100 million an acre back in 2004, 2005 is that we have very few drilling commitments, a lot of our leases are five and ten year leases with no drilling commitments with an age royalty. I think our average cost per acres is $500 bucks. ", "So, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s pressuring us to have drill it up now or tomorrow, other than just trying to add NAV for our shareholders. So, again we will revisit that from time-to-time. We looked at what Southwestern done the Fayetteville, but once they had a really good idea and had defined the play what they did is then they high-graded their acreage and they sold some acreage off, but still we are a year or two away, at least several years away from getting to the same place when Southwestern did that we need to consider doing that in the Marcellus.", "The other thing is it\u2019s so that much bigger than the rest of plays, it\u2019s going to take a little long to develop it out and see where the good spots and the poor spots are. So I think it\u2019s a great question, Biju and I think clearly overtime we\u2019ll consider all those things and we\u2019ll take the appropriate action. ", "We just need more information, and the only way we are going to get that is us and the other companies just need to drill more wells and as it becomes more defined, then we\u2019ll take action as we see appropriate.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Mr. Pinkerton for any closing remarks.", "John Pinkerton", "We appreciate all the range shareholders, for your continued support of the company. We\u2019re excited about what we\u2019ve got and what we\u2019ve had. I think you can see that and feel that from Jeff and his presentation. It\u2019s really exciting place to be to think of a company that\u2019s our size that could be involved with one of the largest gas fields in the U.S. It\u2019s really, really exciting and we feel privileged and going to work out tails off.", "Again, our goal is really simple. We want to make it real for the existing shareholders at range and we\u2019re all fully invested and we are really working and trying to make that real for the range shareholders. With that we\u2019ll sign-off and we\u2019ll see you next quarter. Thank you very much.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

This call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.", "Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome. Range reported results for the third quarter of 2009 with record production, leading the consensus number and clearly, continuing to execute our business plan for 2009.", "The third quarter marked our 27th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. Range is within our focus now of being able to achieve seven years of quarterly sequential production growth. Although we\u2019re encouraged with this ability to grow production, we\u2019re more focused on achieving those targets at an optimum cost structure on per share basis to maximize shareholder values. I think you will hear those same principles reiterated from each of our speakers today.", "On the call with me are John Pinkerton, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Ventura, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Roger Manny, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Before turning the call over to John, I\u2019d like to cover a few administrative items. First, we did file our 10-Q with the SEC this morning. It\u2019s now available on the home page of our website, or you can access it using the SEC\u2019s EDGAR system. In addition, we posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDA, cash margins, and the reconciliation of our non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call.", "Tables are also posted on the website that will give the detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter. Also posted on home page of our website is a short video showing one of our Walking Rigs in Pennsylvania in operation. You might find it interesting if you\u2019ve not been able to visit our operations in Pennsylvania in person.", "Second, we will be participating in several conferences and roadshows in the upcoming weeks. Check our website for a complete listing for the next several months.", "Jeff Ventura just spoke at the Oil and Gas Investor\u2019s DUG conference in Pittsburgh earlier this week. This presentation is posted on the website, and includes several new technical slides covering our Marcellus development, if you missed it. We will be at Pritchard\u2019s Appalachian conference in Boston on November 16, the Bank of America-Merrill Lynch energy conference in New York on November 17, the Friedman Billings energy conference December 2 in New York, and the Wells Fargo Conference in New York on December 8, and Capital One Southcoast\u2019s conference in New Orleans on December 9.", "Now, let me turn the call over to John.", "John H. Pinkerton", "Thanks, Rodney. Before Roger reviews our second quarter financial results. I\u2019ll spend a little bit of time reviewing some of the accomplishments for the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, third quarter production rose 13%, beating the high end of the guidance. The 13% increase includes the impact of selling our Fuhrman-Mascho field effective June 30, 2009.", "If we hadn\u2019t sold Fuhrman-Mascho, production would have been a 17% increase, this marks the 27th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. The driver for this was a higher than anticipated production from exceptional drilling in the Barnett and Marcellus shale plays.", "Second, our drilling program was on schedule throughout the quarter, as we built 128 wells. We continue to be extremely pleased with the drilling results, and despite the lower prices, are generating attractive rates of return. We currently have 15 rigs running, versus 23 this time last year.", "The 13% increase in production was more than offset by a 30% decrease in realized prices as a result, third quarter \u201809 financial results were lower than the prior year. We are most pleased on the cost side, as our cash costs were well below the prior year. I\u2019m particularly pleased with the unit lease offering costs, as they\u2019re averaging $0.75 per mcf; this was a whopping 25% lower than last year.", "With regards to our Marcellus Shale play, significant headway was made, as we continue to drill some terrific wells, build and high-grade our acreage position, build out infrastructure, and bring down our well cost. In addition, we continue to add high-quality personnel to our Marcellus team, which Jeff will talk about.", "In summary, our third quarter results were the best in our company\u2019s history from an operating perspective, and particularly, we did this while at the same time, keeping our capital expenditures within cash flow.", "All in all, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased on how much we\u2019ve accomplished so far this year. It\u2019s a real testimony to the entire Range team.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger, who will review our financial results", "Roger S. Manny", "Thank you, John. The third quarter of 2009 is in many ways a reprint of the second quarter of 2009, except for our Herculean effort on production. Oil and gas production set a new record high, despite significant asset sales. And direct operating costs were down even more significantly than last quarter.", "Importantly, like the second quarter, our liquidity and balance sheet remain just as strong at the end of the quarter as the beginning. Oil and gas sales for the third quarter, including cash-settled derivatives, totaled 255 million down 21% from the 322 million in revenues last year. As John mentioned, the 13% increase in production just could not offset the 30% decrease in oil and gas prices.", "Sales and production were both higher than in the second quarter of this year, which as John also mentioned is a noteworthy achievement given our June 30 sale of the Fuhrman assets, which were producing approximately 15 million a day.", "Cash flow for the third quarter of \u201809 was 171 million, 25% below the third quarter of \u201808, but up 15 million from the second quarter of this year. Cash flow per share for the quarter totaled $1.08, $0.04 per share higher than the analyst consensus estimate of $1.04.", "Quarterly EBITDAX of 198 million was 22% lower than the 254 million earned in the third quarter of \u201808. The cash margins for the third quarter were $4.14 per mcfe. That\u2019s higher than the $3.93 per mcfe last quarter, but 35% below last year due to lower oil and gas prices. So, the real story on margins for the quarter is a 15% reduction in cash expenses. We shaved $0.40 per mcfe in cash costs off of last year\u2019s third quarter figures, with lease operating expense down 25% year-over-year.", "Like last quarter, mark-to-market hedge accounting pushed us into a pre-tax loss position, albeit a pre-tax book loss of 45 million for the quarter, rather than last quarter\u2019s loss of 62 million. The non-cash derivative mark-to-market loss for the third quarter totaled 53 million. It\u2019s counter-intuitive of the way these mark-to-market gains and losses always seem to go the opposite direction of prices, and perhaps the easiest way to explain is that when prices were falling last year, we were booking large non-cash mark-to-market gains, as our hedges became more valuable. Now that prices are firming again, we\u2019re having to book losses, as our hedges are comparatively less valuable than when prices were lower in the previous quarter.", "Going all the way to the bottom line for a minute, before drilling down on third quarter costs, quarterly earnings, calculated using analyst consensus methodology for the third quarter, were $41 million, or $0.26 per fully diluted share. That\u2019s $0.04 higher than the analyst consensus estimate of $0.42.", "The quarterly GAAP after tax net loss was 30 million. And as Rodney and I never fail to mention, the Range Resources website contains a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures mentioned on this call, including analyst earnings, cash flow, net tax, and cash margins.", "As I mentioned earlier, the third quarter this year represents the first full quarter following our second quarter Fuhrman asset sale. Not only we were able to make up the lost production volume from the sale, we were able to replace the production from substantially lower operating cost areas, And the asset sale, combined with continued downward pressure in service costs, is what led to the third quarter direct operating expense figure of $0.75 per mcfe.", "The good news on the cost gets even better when you add cash production taxes to the total. Now, because production taxes are based on well head prices, not hedge prices, production taxes for the third quarter were $0.19 per mcfe, compared to $0.43 in the third quarter of last year.", "Now we\u2019re optimistic that these recent operating cost reductions will hold, and that cash direct operating expense in the mid-$0.70 per mcfe range maybe expected in the fourth quarter.", "General and administrative expense, adjusted for non-cash stock compensation, was $0.57 per mcfe. That\u2019s up $0.03 from the third quarter of last year. The primary reasons for the G&A unit cost increase are the closing of our Houston office, and the resulting $840,000 accrual for severance, and an increase on our reserve for bad debt of $1.1 million.", "These items total $0.05 per mcfe, which accounts for the G&A unit cost increase from the second quarter. We will record additional expenses associated with the closure of the Houston office in the fourth quarter as they\u2019re realized. But the office closure will reduce future G&A expense by approximately 4 million. This will be redeployed into our high growth areas, primarily the Marcellus Shale.", "The non-cash deferred compensation plan expense was somewhat higher this quarter at $16.4 million. Long-time listeners will recall that this non-cash mark-to-market expense is primarily a reflection of the increase in the value of Range common stock held in the deferred comp plans. It does not represent the contribution to the plan, or a change in anyone\u2019s compensation. We expect recurring cash G&A expense per mcfe to hover around the $0.55 mark for the fourth quarter.", "Interest expense for the third quarter of \u201809 was $0.76 per mcfe. That\u2019s up $0.05 for the third quarter last year, as we replaced short-term floating rate bank debt with additional long-term fixed rate subordinated notes earlier this year. Total debt outstanding has been roughly constant all year long.", "Exploration expense for the third quarter of \u201809, excluding non-cash stock-comp expense, was $10 million. Now this expense was $8 million below last year with the reduction mostly coming from lower seismic expense. We expect total fourth quarter exploration expense to be in the $12 million to $14 million Range.", "Depletion, depreciation, and amortization per mcfe for the second quarter \u201809 was $2.42 that\u2019s up $0.17 from the prior quarter and $0.27 from the prior year. This higher figure stems from three factors: One, the mature Fuhrman assets we sold had a depletion rate 20% below the company average. Two, incremental production offsetting the sale came from areas such as the Barnett and Marcellus, where the depletion rates are still above the company average, reflecting many years of early stage exploration and development expenses without corresponding reserve additions.", "Three, we have reallocated capital from our mature legacy fields with low depletion rates to higher rate of return projects, and that has reduced incremental production in the mature lower depletion rate areas. Now this type of increase in DD&A should be temporary, as next quarter we will be resetting our DD&A rate based upon our year-end reserve report, which will include the results from our highly successful 2009 drilling performance.", "While completion of the year-end reserve report is still several months away, our experience in the Barnett Shale has taught us to expect declines in the depletion rate over time, as early stage shale play R&D costs are amortized, and capital efficiency improves. It\u2019s also worth remembering that Range has experienced no meaningful property impairments, so our DD&A rate has not been reduced the wrong way, that is, by a multi-billion dollar ceiling test write-down.", "One of the primary drivers of our improving capital efficiency at Range is our practice of allocating capital on a real-time basis. Well economics are not only run each year during the capital budget process, but before each well is drilled. Now this enables us to shift our drilling capital to the areas where we\u2019re seeing our best returns, and requires all Range divisions to continually improve their returns to be competitive.", "We are witnessing the fruits of the flavor as we\u2019re producing solid double-digit production growth this year without acquisitions, and despite asset sales, with fewer than half the number of rigs as last year. There is a bit of a downside associated with this practice, however, when it comes to accounting for unproved property. The decision to drop rigs and reallocate drilling capital means that we will not be drilling on certain leases that have near-term expirations.", "This prompts us to continually reexamine the status of our leasehold positions, and take additional impairments to our unproved properties in areas where we deem the acreage less valuable, or likely to expire. Now what this means for the third quarter of \u201809 is that we impaired 24 million in unproved properties versus $5 million in the third quarter of \u201808.", "Eventually, we expect the level of these impairments will normalize, as unproved property works its way through the acreage lifecycle, and our drilling activity increases. Investors wishing a more extensive explanation of the unproved property impairment process for successful efforts accounting companies and how it compares to full cost companies, may wish to review my conference call comments from the first and second quarters of this year.", "Now, the CliffsNotes version of those comments is that an investor should treat unproved property impairments for successful efforts companies in the same way they treat ceiling test impairments for full cost companies. Now we anticipate unproved property impairment of between $16 million  and 18 million in the fourth quarter of this year.", "Range recorded a $15 million deferred tax benefit for the third quarter, and we booked a $695,000 income tax benefit for the quarter. And with our filing of the \u201808 federal return, our NOL carry forward at the end of the year is $291 million, approximately $140 million of this carry forward will be used to offset the taxable gain on the sale of the Fuhrman assets. The NOL used will be replenished in \u201809 through intangible drilling cost deductions. We anticipate a 36% tax rate for all of 2009.", "Range continues to benefit from its 2009 hedges, and we have approximately two-thirds of our fourth quarter gas production hedged at a floor price of 7.79 Mmbtu, and a ceiling price of 8.53. We have also continued layering in additional hedges on our 2010 production during the third quarter. Price collars are now in place, covering approximately 50% of our expected natural gas production for all of 2010. Slightly more than 50% of the first half of 2010 production is hedged with a floor price of 5.50 Mmbtu, and a ceiling price of 7.45. We have slightly more than 40% of our second half 2010 production hedged, and those are the collars at 5.59 by 7.50 per Mmbtu.", "The best news on the balance sheet front this quarter is that there is no news. Overall debt-to-capitalization is essentially flat at 42%, and bank debt is actually slightly down this quarter at $398 million, compared to $403 million last quarter. The absence of incremental debt and equity reflects our disciplined approach to capital spending, wholly spending to within cash flow and asset sale proceeds. And we announced earlier this month that the 26-member Range bank group has unanimously reaffirmed unchanged the $1.5 billion borrowing base under our credit facility.", "Our current bank debt balance provides Range over $1 billion in unused borrowing base capacity, and approximately $850 million in committed liquidity. While I jest about no news being good news on the Range balance sheet and there are actually some very important stories going on behind the numbers here. Now there\u2019s a story between the lines regarding our bank borrowing base re-determination.", "Range completed a significant asset sale last quarter, and we\u2019re in a significantly lower gas price environment, yet our bank borrowing base was reaffirmed at the same 1.5 billion level, in a still challenging bank credit market without any changes to the interest rate or terms. The story here is the about our creditworthiness, specifically, the quality and diversification of our asset base, our low cost structure, and our ability to consistently and efficiently replace not only reserves produced, but even assets sold.", "There\u2019s another story told by the fact that our balance sheet leverage in \u201809 has not increased, even though we\u2019re cranking out double-digit production growth, unaided by prior year proven property acquisitions. This story is one of spending years building a class-leading drilling inventory, rigorous capital spending discipline, and prudent assets sales. Or stated simply, high-grading our investment opportunities and living within our means during a tough commodity price cycle.", "There\u2019s also a story a bit further down the balance sheet, as we have not made a cash secondary offering on the equity side since 2008. This story is one of focus upon true value creation for you, our shareholders, low cost, consistent reserve and production growth, not on absolute basis, but on a per share basis. Some quarters stand out for what happened, and some quarters stand out for what did not happen. And the third quarter of \u201809 brought a bit of both for Range, solid incremental improvements in production volume, cost reductions, cash flow, and our hedging position, all the while, respecting the balance sheet.", "So John, I\u2019ll turn it all back you.", "John H. Pinkerton", "Thanks, Roger. Now, let\u2019s hear from Jeff on the operations.", "Jeff L. Ventura", "Thanks, John. I\u2019ll begin my reviewing productions. For the third quarter, production averaged 437 million per day, a 13% increase over the third quarter of 2008. This represents the highest quarterly production rate in the company\u2019s history and the 27th consecutive quarter sequential production growth. This is a great accomplishment by the team, given that we closed on the sale of Fuhrman right at the end of the second quarter, which reduced production by about 15 million per day. Also, we dropped rigs in the Southwest and Midcontinent Divisions throughout the second and third quarters. To overcome all of that is outstanding.", "I\u2019ll begin with the operations update with the Marcellus Shale. To date, Range has drilling completed 60 horizontal Marcellus Shale wells. 54 of the wells are currently on-line, and today, we\u2019re producing over 80 million per day net. Our current cost to drill and complete one of these wells in the Southwest Pennsylvania from a multi-well pad is about $3.5 million. Based on the zero time slot we released earlier, which includes 24 wells, our expected ultimate gross recovery is 4.4 Bcfe.", "Factoring in the production profile, which is shown on our website, our average royalty and current gas price adjustments and assuming a $5 per Mmbtu gas price resulted a 46% rate of return and cost to sign and develop of $0.95 per Mmcfe. At a $7 gas price, the rate of return increases to 75%. We believe this is the best rate of return in finding any new development cost of any large-scale, repeatable play in the United States.", "In the past, I\u2019ve stated that the average reserve expectation across all of our acreage position is in the three to four Bcfe range. To-date, our average well has been about 4.4 Bcfe, which is above the top end of the range. I would caution that more wells and more production are necessary to determine what the actual number will be. We\u2019re still very early in the development of this play. For now, I\u2019m still comfortable with the three to four Bcfe range for the expanse of our acreage, and where it is located.", "In the southwestern part of the play, we have approximately 550,000 net acres. To date, we\u2019ve drilled and completed 117 wells in the area. 60 of these are horizontal wells and almost all were successful, excluding the initial science wells. The distance between our northern and southern-most horizontal Marcellus Shale wells in southwest Pennsylvania is 40 miles. The distance between our eastern and western-most horizontal Marcellus Shale wells in southwest Pennsylvania is 41 miles. Within this box, we have 177,000 net acres, or 32% of our 550,000 net acres in this part of the play. Based on our early results, we feel very strong about this area. We consider it low risk, and have moved into the commercial development of this area.", "In the same area, the distance between the industry\u2019s northern and southern-most wells is 81 miles. The industry\u2019s eastern and western-most wells in southwest Pennsylvania is 59 miles. Within this box, Range has 390,000 net acres, or 71% of our 550,000 net acres in southwest PA. Approximately 320 industry wells, including Range\u2019s wells, have been drilled in and around Range\u2019s acreage, which has significantly de-risked even more of Range\u2019s acreage.", "Using just the 390,000 net acres, within what we believe is a low risk, high-chance-of-success, de-risk box, and assuming that 80% of the acreage is ultimately drilled, and assuming 80-acre spacing, we can potentially drill 3,900 horizontal wells. Assuming 3.5 Bcfe per well, that\u2019s 13.7 Tcf gross, or 11.6 Tcfe net unrisked reserve potential for Range.", "On our acreage in the southwest, gas in place averages about 100 Bcf per section. Assuming 80 acres per well, and assuming that the wells average 3.5 Bcfe recovery, the recovery factor calculates to be about 24% of the gas in place. It\u2019s possible that through a combination of improved recoveries per well and tighter spacing, we may be able to significantly increase the recovery of the gas in place, which is what historically the industry\u2019s done. Range is currently a 2.7 Tcf company, therefore, we have the potential to grow significantly from just this one play, and just this one area. Importantly, the expected rate of return on this capital is exceptional.", "In the northeast portion of the play, we have an additional 350,000 net acres. This represents another 5 Tcfe to 7 Tcfe of net unrisked reserve potential for Range. We\u2019re currently drilling two back-to-back horizontal wells in the northeast. Both horizontal wells offer excellent vertical wells or offset excellent vertical wells that we\u2019ve previously drilled and tested.", "We also see significant upside potential in both the Utica Shale and Upper Devonian Shale on our portions of our acreage. Prior to year-end, we plan to spud two horizontal wells to test each of these concepts. At year-end 2007, Range\u2019s Marcellus production was about eight million per day net. At year-end 2008, we\u2019re producing about 26 million per day net. At year-end 2009, we should be about 90 million to 100 million per day, and we\u2019re currently planning on doubling that to 180 million to 200 million per day by year-end 2010. Future growth beyond that looks encouraging. We\u2019re currently running five big rigs, and four smaller air rigs drilling ahead of them. We\u2019ll have one additional horizontal rig drilling by year-end.", "I wanted to discuss one last item for the Marcellus project. We\u2019ve made very significant progress in regards to water. We\u2019re currently recycling 100% of all of our water in the development area in the southwest. When we frac the horizontal well, we only get roughly 15 to 35% of the frac water back; the rest stays in the formation. Now, that we\u2019re pad drilling in the southwest, we have water retention facilities that service multiple wells.", "We start with 100% of the required water, pump it into the well being stimulated, and then flow the water back. As mentioned previously, the well will flow back only a fraction of the water back into the water containment, and then it\u2019s refilled back up in order to frac the next well, and so on for future wells. This is really important, because it significantly reduces the amount of water required for fracturing. It also eliminates and need to truck the flowback water away and dispose of it. This zero discharge method of doing business results in great cost reductions from not having to truck and dispose the water. From both an environmental and economic point of view, it\u2019s clearly the way forward.", "I\u2019m very proud of our team for pioneering the Marcellus play in Pennsylvania. Our team now consists of approximately 190 people, approximately 40 of these people are either engineers, geologists, geophysicists, or linemen. I believe that we have one of the best shale teams in the industry. We continually look at adding first-round draft picks for the team when possible.", "Recently, we\u2019ve added two outstanding individuals to the team. Joe Frantz, who has a petroleum and natural gas engineering degree from Penn State, and about 26 years of industry experience, recently joined our team. He\u2019s a recognized leader in developing unconventional gas, and has worked on all of the major shale plays in the U.S. Joe actually did some of the engineering work on our first shale well in the Marcellus, which was a success. At the time, he ran Schlumberger\u2019s Appalachian office in Pittsburgh.", "The other person who recently joined our team is Scott Roy. Scott has 17 years in public service in various positions, including key roles in both the Ridge and Rendell administrations, and acting as the governor\u2019s liaison to various regulatory and environmental agencies. Scott will play a key role in forging strong partnerships among public, regulatory, and industry interests to ensure that development of the Marcellus Shale is accomplished in a responsible way.", "Let me briefly update you on our other two major properties. Staying in the Appalachian basin, I\u2019ll discuss Nora first. Successful drilling continues in all three horizons. In the coalbed methane, we had a very good year. Most of the infill wells are performing on par with the original wells, and in some cases, drilling the infill is improving the original well on the spacing unit. CPM wells today are costing about $340,000, and the reserves are about $350 million. At a $5 flat gas price, the rate of return is about 32%. At $7, it\u2019s about 58%.", "The vertical tight gas sand wells have even higher rates of return. At a $5 flat gas price, they generate a 40% rate of return, and this improves to 73% at $7. We\u2019re currently experimenting with horizontal drilling in the Brea Sands and Big Lime formations, with encouraging results so far. We\u2019ve also now drilled about 20 horizontal Huron Shale wells so far scattered across our acreage position. This looks very good, and has de-risked approximately 1.5 Tcf to Range from this horizon alone.", "In the Barnett, although we\u2019ve decreased our rig count from about six rigs at the beginning of the year to one currently, we\u2019ve driven production up from 110 million at the beginning of the year to about 130 million per day today. This is an excellent job by our Barnett team. The rates of return on our Barnett wells are still very good. Even at $5 gas, they\u2019re still 32%.", "We have many locations to drill in the Barnett, but fortunately, we don\u2019t have any significant drilling commitments. The bulk of our acreage in the quarter, where our remaining locations exist, is largely held by production.", "So, as good as Range has been in the past, we should be even better in the future. The F&D costs for all three major properties, the Marcellus and the Barnett Shales, and Nora, ranges from about $1 to $1.50, and the LOEs from all three properties are low. It\u2019s also important that two of our top three projects are in the Appalachian basin, where the gas price has been better than anywhere else in the U.S.", "Range has consistently delivered top-tier organic production or reserve growth with one of lowest cost structures in the business. This is a direct result of our simple strategy of strong, organic growth, a top-quartile cost structure or better, and in addition, consistently building and high-grading our inventory, coupled with one of best teams in the industry.", "We believe Range today has more upside, and lower risk upside, than in any time in the company\u2019s history. With our inventory, we have the opportunity to grow the company more than tenfold, primarily from the Marcellus Shale, Nora, and the Barnett Shale. We believe our excellent organic growth, combined with an excellent cost structure, will result in continuing to create strong shareholder returns over time.", "Back to you, John.", "John H. Pinkerton", "Thanks, Jeff. Terrific report. Looking to the fourth quarter of 2009, we see continued strong operating results. For the fourth quarter, we\u2019re looking for production to average 455 to 460 million per day, representing roughly a 14% increase year-over-year, and approximately a 5% increase over the third quarter of \u201809.", "Taking account both the asset sales and the drilling results today, we have increased our full year 2009 production growth target from 10% to 13%. Given our reduced capital program, we focus about roughly 90% of our CapEx on the Marcellus, Nora, and Barnett plays.", "These plays generate attractive returns, even at low prices, as Jeff discussed. We\u2019re fortunate that the remaining properties we have a shallow decline curve, in particular, our tight gas sand properties in Appalachia and West Texas on a decline of roughly 10%.", "One of the key elements that we have talked about from time-to-time that\u2019s having a very key impact on us is our capital efficiency. As Jeff mentioned, in the last several years we\u2019ve spent considerable capital in the Marcellus play without getting to see much of a return on that. Beginning on October of \u201808, this all changed as the first phase of the infrastructure was completed, and production began to ramp up.", "As our Marcellus production continues to ramp up, we\u2019re seeing this capital efficiency impact having an ever increasing impact on our company. This is allowing us to do more with less. In the third quarter, our CapEx totaled $171 million, including the $4 million of the Marcellus acreage we acquired in exchange for Range common stock.", "So, our cash CapEx total was $167 million, which was fully funded by $171 million of operating cash flow. For the full year 2009, our cash flow and completed asset sales should be more than adequate to fund our CapEx program. After closing the Fuhrman-Mascho sell, our Board approved that 6% increase in our 2009 CapEx budget from 700 million to 740 million. The additional funds were used to acquire acreage in areas where we\u2019ve had our drilling success, and primarily in the Marcellus play.", "At year-end 2008, we spoke about the transformation that would take place once we began to ramp up our Marcellus production. The third quarter results clearly reflected this transformation. In the third quarter, we were able to significantly increase production and decrease cost, maintain capital spending within our cash flow, thereby strengthening our financial position. This was done without the benefit of producing property acquisitions, or having to go to the market and issue equity to fund our growth. In my opinion, it is this kind of performance that drive shareholder value in our business.", "Next, I\u2019ll spend a few minutes discussing the Marcellus Shale play. As mentioned in our release, and as Jeff has discussed, Marcellus production [natural] gas range is now running over 80 million per day. Assuming no major pipeline issues, we anticipate reaching the high end of our $90 million to $100 million range by year-end. In addition, we have significantly reduced our drilling cost in southwest PA to roughly $3.5 million per well, as Jeff mentioned. In addition to reducing costs, we\u2019re finding ways to do things in a more proactive environmental manner, by recycling 100% of the flowback water in southwest PA.", "Looking ahead, there are some very exciting next steps that are taking place in the Marcellus. First, the pipeline infrastructure build-out is growing very well. Within the next 90 days, the start-up of the 120 million a day gas processing plant should take place.", "Second, we have commenced drilling two, our first two horizontal wells in northwest PA or northeast PA that offset two of our best vertical wells. We have a very large acreage position in northeast PA covering roughly 350,000 acres. Third, we have spud our first Utica horizontal well, and fourth, we should spud shortly our first Devonian shale horizontal test. These four wells are important, because if they\u2019re successful, it could add multiple Tcf of additional reserve potential to Range. We should have some of the preliminary results on these wells by our year-end conference call, when we report year-end results. So, that\u2019s pretty exciting.", "Lastly, I\u2019ll spend a few minutes discussing the outlook for 2010. I will work it on the 2010 capital budget, and there are several avenues we can take. Currently, we expect to take the same type of approach we did for 2009. We expect cash flow and asset sales to fund our 2010 capital program. We\u2019ve recently identified the properties we anticipate selling. Taking a rough cut at the asset sales combined with the expected cash flow, we believe we\u2019ll be able to execute a capital program that will once again deliver solid double-digit production growth at low cost.", "Specifically, when you look at 2010, the Marcellus will be our primary growth driver. We are planning to double the Marcellus production in 2010. Therefore, we\u2019re looking for a net production in the Marcellus to reach 180 million to 200 million a day by year-end 2010.", "I think the keyword here is net production, as many producers provide gross volumes, which in my opinion, are not relevant. This is especially true with all the joint ventures that are being done, where companies are selling off percentages of their entire acreage position. We continue to believe that we want to maintain our entire position in the Marcellus, and grow it, versus selling part of it off to a third party. Also, joint ventures are never easy to manage, so we prefer not to complicate our operations with joint ventures. Said another way, we prefer to sell our higher cost, more mature properties, and maintain and grow our higher return, higher potential properties.", "On the equity issuance question, our strategy remains unchanged. We prefer to sell properties versus selling equity. Given that we expect cash flow and asset sales to once again fund our capital program, we don\u2019t currently see any need for selling equity in 2010, unless we have an opportunity to make an attractive acquisition of a sizable acreage block, or producing property package in one of our key project areas.", "And certainly, looking at Range today, we have the largest and highest-quality drilling inventory in our history. Our inventory, together with our emerging plays, represents 20 Tcf to 28 Tcf of future growth potential. This equates to seven to 10 times our existing crude reserves. While we\u2019re excited about the potential growth at Range, we\u2019re intently focused on delivering each quarter. I think the third quarter of \u201809 is a shining example of this commitment by all the employees at Range, and I compliment each one of them for their excellent work in the quarter.", "With that, operator, let\u2019s turn the call open for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Section", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Pinkerton. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mr. Tom Gardner with Simmons & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Thomas Gardner \u2013 Simmons & Company", "Thank you, operator. John, just circling back on what you just said with regard to the rigs moving into the northeast portion of the Marcellus. I believe Jeff mentioned on the last call that those rigs were moving in there in August. Just wanted to see if you had any sort of results to date and perhaps get an update on the development timing in northeast portion of the play?", "Jeff L. Ventura", "This is Jeff. Let me take and crack at that. Yeah, Tom, I did say that on the last call, the rigs we\u2019re getting are the special built rigs, and they were slow to be delivered, so that got delayed a little bit. But we\u2019re currently drilling simultaneously two wells in the northeast. One offsets our best vertical well made over 6 million per day from a vertical well, so we have high hopes for that and the other one\u2019s offsetting also an excellent vertical well that made over 2 million per day. They\u2019re drilling simultaneously, they\u2019re already at significant depth. So I feel comfortable we\u2019ll have results by the end of the year.", "We\u2019re already preplanning, once we drilled the good vertical wells, we shot 3D to cover it, so we\u2019re drilling the horizontal wells off the 3D directly offsetting the vertical, we\u2019ve already acquired pipeline right away, we\u2019ve already acquired our caps. So, I think that area high I have good hopes for, high hopes for and I expect it will come online towards the end of the next year, with good results for these two wells. You\u2019ll see us doing some drilling in the northeast next year, primarily focused in the southwest, ramping up production, continuing to drill in the northeast and then we\u2019ll have our pipeline on there by the end of next year, it\u2019s all going to be dry gas, with significant development in 2010 in that area.", "Thomas Gardner \u2013 Simmons & Company", "Thanks Jeff. Just staying with the northeast portion of the play. How much acreage do you currently have in New York? And can you give us an update on these regulatory initiatives, and the ultimate impact perhaps on drilling in the state?", "Jeff L. Ventura", "Yeah, well, we have roughly 2 million acres in the basin. When we talk about 1.4 million acres for the Marcellus that\u2019s prospective. Let me talk about that that 1.4 million acres basically is almost all in Pennsylvania, a little bit in the West Virginia panhandle, right adjacent to Pennsylvania. We\u2019re not counting any New York acreage at all as being prospective for the Marcellus.", "And when we talked about our high-graded acreage, the 900,000 that\u2019s basically again, almost all in Pennsylvania, a little bit in the West Virginia panhandle. And the difference, that other 500,000 acres has potential for the Marcellus, but it\u2019s behind pipe and existing wells that we have. There, we\u2019ll be looking at it as a recompletion potential, or later on, but it\u2019s on HBP oil and HBP acreage.", "So, when we originally went back and targeted the Marcellus, when we started the play several years back, we targeted different areas predominantly in southwest Pennsylvania and northeast Pennsylvania, we did not target New York. I\u2019m not saying New York doesn\u2019t have potential, it just wasn\u2019t within our originally targeted areas, and as we\u2019ve continued to refine our model, our model actually has held up very well, and it\u2019s been very robust. And we continue to target basically those same areas.", "John H. Pinkerton", "Yeah, Tom, and this is John, I think that\u2019s Jeff\u2019s perspective is more, let\u2019s say, from a geological perspective. The other perspective is kind of the business perspective. And as, and maybe some people don\u2019t, we\u2019ve been operating up in Appalachia for over 25 years now. And we are one of the largest producers in natural gas in the State of New York. That didn\u2019t mean a lot, but we\u2019re still the largest producers in New York.", "So, we know firsthand how difficult, on a relative basis, is New York versus PA versus West Virginia versus Ohio versus Virginia, and we take all of that into account when we look at this play. And there is no doubt in our mind that New York, was going to be more challenging from a regulatory perspective. It always has been, and in my view, always will. I don\u2019t want to go into why we believe that, but I think most people can just see that for themselves. I\u2019m not bringing up something that I think is all that earth-shattering here.", "So again, I think in all these plays, whether it\u2019s the Barnett, or whether you want to be drilling wells in downtown Fort Worth, or whether it\u2019s the Marcellus or all the other plays. You got to take your technical work, and overlay with what you think the business risks are. And quite frankly, when we did that, New York was not one of the ones that, that popped out, where we ought to be buying acreage. So, that in a nutshell is why we don\u2019t own any material Marcellus potential in New York. Again, just want to reiterate what Jeff said is that, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t think that it\u2019s bad, we just think Pennsylvania is better.", "Thomas Gardner \u2013 Simmons & Company", "Got you and thank you, guys. I\u2019ll let someone else hop on. I always have more questions [though] but I\u2019ll let someone else take a crack at it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice. Please proceed with your question.", "Ronald Mills \u2013 Johnson & Rice", "Good morning. Just to follow up on the northeast PA, and somewhat what you were just speaking of, John. From a permitting standpoint, can you walk through some of the differences in terms of the northeast Pennsylvania permitting process and timeframe versus what you\u2019re experiencing currently in the southwestern portion of the state?", "John H. Pinkerton", "Well go ahead.", "Jeff L. Ventura", "John and I are battling on who\u2019s going to answer, we can both chime in. I guess I\u2019ll go first. When you talk about the southwest, the process has become good. It\u2019s significantly improved. I think we routinely get permits in 30 days, or in some cases, significantly less, so that\u2019s going well.", "In the northeast, again, it\u2019s easy when we talk about areas, these are large areas, you\u2019re talking about a state. Whether you\u2019re in the Delaware River Basin or Susquehanna River Basin, it all makes a difference. Where we are is in the farther east you go, the more difficult that gets, and we don\u2019t have any acreage out in the far east either, which is again, where we start with the technical analysis of where we want to be, and then overlay the business aspects to that as well. So, we\u2019ve been able to get our permits and to move forward. John, do you want to add on to that, or?", "John H. Pinkerton", "Yeah, I think and again, I think the key here is that clearly, over the next year or two, the major driver is going to be the southwest for us. I mean, we\u2019re going to drill some wells in the northeast. We\u2019re excited about the potential, but in terms of delivering the gas in the pipeline, and ramping up the production, it\u2019s going to come from the southwest or the great majority of that\u2019s going to come from the southwest.", "In that area, as Jeff mentioned, the permitting process has gotten very routine, 30 days. I heard recently we got one permit in eight days, to give you an example. We\u2019ve got a program there, and we\u2019ve got a fairly blocky acreage position, so it\u2019s going quite well, just like it does in the Barnett or Woodford, or any other plays that we\u2019re in terms of horizontal drilling. So, it\u2019s become like clockwork.", "The northeast, as you move away and again, you got to think about how the oil and gas in Pennsylvania was first developed. Most of the oil and gas in Pennsylvania was developed in the southwest part of the play. In fact, our Renz well, our first well drilled in the Marcellus isn\u2019t too far away from the first oil drilled in United States by Colonel Drake, which was exactly 150 years ago on August 27, which also happens to be my anniversary date, that\u2019s why I remember it.", "So, because of that, you got all the infrastructure and all the other things down in the southwest. The northeast, there\u2019s just less infrastructure, there\u2019s been less drilling up there, there\u2019s less service, blah blah blah blah. So again that over time, that will solve itself, just like it has in the southwest. The southwest now, in terms of services and everything else, has become pretty much just like the Barnett. So, that\u2019s again, that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019ve been able to drive down costs, because now you\u2019re getting competition for services, things are more routine, blah blah blah blah blah.", "So, and again, all that relates to how you allocate capital,  mean, we can go faster in drilling in the southwest than we can in the northeast just because of those reasons. So, again, that\u2019s why we\u2019re focused in the southwest, because we think from a risk perspective, from reserves to business to service, all the other stuff you have to think about, that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused.", "That being said again, like Jeff said, there\u2019s enormous, we\u2019ve got 350,000 acres. We\u2019re one of the largest leaseholders in the northeast and people forget about it that all the time. So, we\u2019re really excited about these two wells, to say the least. Hopefully and knock on wood and do a couple of back flips, but come year-end, we\u2019ll be able to get you some pretty interesting results from those wells.", "Ronald Mills \u2013 Johnson & Rice", "Okay, and then from the Utica standpoint, and/or the upper Devonian, and obviously, you\u2019re seeing the upper Devonian in your Marcellus wells. But from an aerial extent, or from an acreage standpoint, how much of Utica\u2019s acreage do you think you end up with some Utica potential obviously, depending on some test wells being successful.", "Jeff L. Ventura", "Yeah. We think a significant portion of our acreage is prospective for the Utica, particularly the acreage that\u2019s in the southwest. And again, we have 550,000 acres there; we have a big position. Same with the upper Devonian Shale, we think it\u2019s more prospective on the western side, and a lot of our acreage, we think, has potential for that.", "So, the combined, they offer really significant upsides. So, be interesting test we\u2019ll drill both of them this year, complete them this year. It may go a little into next year. So, by the time we have some results, it should be first quarter of next year.", "Ronald Mills \u2013 Johnson & Rice", "", "Okay, great. I\u2019ll let someone else jump in. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Mr. Joe Allman with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Joseph Allman \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody.", "John H. Pinkerton", "", "Hi, Joe.", "Jeff L. Ventura", "", "Good afternoon.", "Joseph Allman \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hey, Jeff, could you quantify the operating cost savings you get from recycling the water and using the retention facilities? And how much of that savings have you seen already?", "Jeff L. Ventura", "", "Yeah. It\u2019s a very significant, because when you have to truck water, it\u2019s expensive. Truck it, and then pay for the disposal facility. You\u2019re looking at savings per well, literally, on the order of a couple hundred thousand dollars per well. So, it\u2019s very impactful. So, it\u2019s clearly economically, the right thing to do. But I really want to stress environmentally, it\u2019s really the right thing to do. Because it really reduces the amount of water you need on the front end, and then you get the zero discharge.", "So, when you\u2019re in a development area with pad drilling it\u2019s really exciting and again, I really want to stop and talk about that point, because a year ago, most people said you couldn\u2019t do it. Even earlier this year, there were a lot of people very skeptical that it could even be done. And then it moved into what would it do to the wells, and okay, we can do it, but what about the quality of wells? Well, none of them have been able to do it.", "But the quality of the wells, we\u2019ve seen no difference at all. So, that\u2019s really important. So, I think that, when you look at water recycling, coupled with we\u2019re also doing a lot of experimenting with disposal wells now. So, if you can couple those two things together, that\u2019s basically taking care all of the water issues.", "Joseph Allman \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, in terms of the operating costs on an mcfe basis, I mean, because of this savings, should we see that, and all other things being equal, come down fairly decently?", "Jeff L. Ventura", "", "Yeah, when you looked at, let me talk about the Marcellus in general. You have two things going on: one, you have high rate flowing gas wells, which are relatively inexpensive to operate. And then, if you can eliminate the trucking, you\u2019re looking at LOEs for Marcellus, really of less than a dime per mcfe. So as we continue to ramp and build Marcellus, and you add that into the rest of the company, it\u2019s going to continue to drive down our LOEs, coupled with the fact that part of our strategy is building high-grading inventory.", "So, we\u2019re focusing on our more efficient projects that not only have a lower LOE, but lower F&D, and then you\u2019re going to couple that with selling things like Fuhrman that have high LOE. And that\u2019s part of the reason that you\u2019re starting to see really significant impact in driving down LOE, but it\u2019s going to like I talked about on the last call, when you look at capital efficiency, you\u2019re going to see us, even though as good as Range has been, I think you\u2019re going to see even better improvements, really, going forward.", "John H. Pinkerton", "And Jeff, this is, hey sorry Joe, let me interrupt you. Jeff, let me ask a question: then why the hell that our DD&A rate go up?", "Jeff L. Ventura", "Well\u2026", "John H. Pinkerton", "Let me answer that, Jeff.", "Jeff L. Ventura", "[No way] let me chime after you\u2019re done, but go ahead.", "John H. Pinkerton", "And let me give some, Roger, I think, went through the technical accounting, and probably think mumbo-jumbo if you want to call it that. But let me give you a big picture, and kind of some business man\u2019s perspective is that: if you think one is, we\u2019re on successful effort, so, we don\u2019t do things, when we calculate DD&A, we do it by property pool. So, all the Marcellus is a pool by itself. I mean we don\u2019t just take everything and throw it together like the full cost guys get to do.", "So, we do pool-by-pool, and we\u2019ve got a number of pools in the company. So, as things change within those pools, it changes the DD&A rates, and as you change production rates between those pools, your overall DD&A rate can change. And so what happened was, is that we bought Fuhrman, the good news, Chad and his team were able to buy Fuhrman at a very low price, our guys did a great job of developing Fuhrman at a low cost. And I think we bought Fuhrman for $212 million, and sold it for 180-something million. So, that\u2019s an A+ check-the-box for all that, but when we sold it, it was still, was a relatively low, even though it had a really high operating cost, over $2 bucks an m, it had a low DD&A rate.", "So you take that out, and you replace it. And we replaced it with Barnett and to a large degree, with Marcellus. Now let\u2019s talk about that for a bit, and let me just zero in on the Marcellus, is that you think about what the Marcellus is that since October of 2004, we\u2019ve spent a whole bunch of dough, almost $1 million in the Marcellus. And we spent enormous amount of money on science, and we spent a lot of money on vertical wells, which we still would have done, thinking back at it, maybe done a little bit differently, probably drilled a few less vertical wells. But there\u2019s a big science bucket there of costs that we\u2019ve got to overcome.", "So, at the beginning of the year, you take each of those pools, and you set your DD&A rate for that pool, okay. And even though production\u2019s going. So now, production in the Marcellus is actually going up and being a bigger part of the total. So, its impact is more. What we don\u2019t do is every quarter, as we drill more wells, change our DD&A rate in the Marcellus. If we\u2019d had done that, our DD&A rate would not have gone up. But we do, do it once a year, and we\u2019re going to do it in the fourth quarter, based on year-end reserves, and once we do that, you\u2019ll see the DD&A rate for the Marcellus come down significantly. And as Roger said, it\u2019s too early to tell, we don\u2019t have the numbers. Al and his team are still working on all the reserve numbers, and you got do all the costs and year-end, blah blah blah. But you\u2019ll see that come back down, so as Roger mentioned, that was a temporary kind of phenomenon, due to the nuances of accounting 101.", "So, that\u2019s the reason for that, but I really wanted to talk about that, because it seemed weird to me that we keep on talking about being low cost, and our DD&A rates going up. And I\u2019m sure most investors saw that as well, and are asking the same question. So again, trying to be transparent and give you a business man\u2019s view of it. And the good news is, I think, over time, as we drill more and more Marcellus wells, you\u2019ll see the DD&A rate continue to go down, and that will have a positive impact on the company, and then the D&A rate and the finding and development costs will begin to merge.", "Joseph Allman \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, good question, John. And Roger, just back to LOE for one second. As a reference point, if you had to truck the water, what do you think your LOE would be?", "Roger S. Manny", "Yeah, I mean, just looking water-hauling disposal cost was dead even at $0.11 this year over last, so that was not a huge change. I think in answer to your other question, we really haven\u2019t seen the P&L benefit of the recycling yet flow through for the Marcellus, since that\u2019s relatively new.", "Joseph Allman \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, all right, and then a separate item. In northeast Pennsylvania, when you finish those two horizontal wells, will you place them onto production right away?", "Jeff L. Ventura", "No, the \u2013 like I mentioned earlier, just clarify, the pipeline for that won\u2019t be up and running till the end of 2010. So, we\u2019ll drill them, we\u2019ll test them, and then we\u2019ll shut \u2018em in and you\u2019ll see us do some drilling around them. But that won\u2019t come on to the batch around the end of 2010. And then, 2011, you\u2019ll see a significant ramp-up up in that area.", "Joseph Allman \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Monroe Helm with CM Energy Partners. Please proceed with your question.", "Monroe Helm \u2013 CM Energy Partners", "I think my questions have been answered, but just a quick one on the Marcellus. If you had better infrastructure there, could you accelerate the pace of drilling over the next two years? Is that kind of the limiting factor?", "Jeff L. Ventura", "What you\u2019ll see us do is basically it\u2019s early, we\u2019re building our budget now, we present it to the Board in December for approval, and typically, talk about it in January, February, but roughly speaking, at this point in time, you\u2019ll see is double the number of wells next year versus what we drilled this year. And like we said, basically double our exit rate from next year to this year. We understand, like I said, within that de-risk box, we think we have the potential to drill significant number of wells and develop, really over a 11.6 Tcfe, just on what we\u2019ve proven up so far.", "So you\u2019re going to see significant growth, but the important part I think we understand, clearly understand the concept of NPV. That is not new to us, we understand that, and that it drives value. We\u2019ve run a number of scenarios looking at the whole play through depletion, how fast we should drill, how does that relate to our balance sheet, and the pipelines, and everything else. But I think when you start, we have a graph on our presentation that shows the trajectory of our growth. And to develop what we think is a multiple Tcf play, there is a lot of upside, and we think ultimately, when you get to full development, you\u2019re going to see a large number of rigs, and potentially, you\u2019re going to be probably looking at 50 rigs or so out in the future.", "So, we\u2019ll be developing, we\u2019ll be driving up production, but we\u2019re also, remember our story is not just about growth, it\u2019s about growth at low cost. And we think the pace we\u2019re going at is a good pace, and it\u2019s impressive growth. But we want to be sensitive to the balance sheet, and to funding and all those types of things as well.", "John H. Pinkerton", "Yeah, and great question Monroe, and I think this year we really and probably made it a large degree, and I\u2019ll let Jeff take it. But we really wanted to focus on our ability to drive down cost per well, and our guys have done a great job at that, and we\u2019ve achieved the goals that we\u2019ve set for them. So, now, we feel comfortable. So, we\u2019re going to exit the year at twice the deep rigs that we started the year with, and I think you\u2019ll see that kind of expansion of the rig. Just you\u2019ll see that as we go out kind of year-after-year, and so that wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to me in terms of three rigs, six rigs, and then in the next year, as you look into 2011, more likely we\u2019ll be at 12 rigs. And then you can probably double again after that. And to get to the number that Jeff talked about.", "So, and then if you run that through, and volumes and what-not, that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take. Again, that\u2019s from the technical perspective, but we run a bunch of modeling in terms of what does that do to the balance sheet. How do you fund that and what-not? And we\u2019re really focused on, it\u2019s not to me, it\u2019s not how many rigs you run, or how much of your production, it\u2019s what you deliver on a per share basis.", "So, we can run real fast. We can run a lot faster when we\u2019re running, but we got to issue a bunch of equity, like some other companies that have done that are in shale plays, and we\u2019ve run those, and we\u2019ve modeled it out, and your NPV just comes out less.", "So, one of the things I\u2019ve learned is that the fewer shares you put out, the more likely your stock price is going to up. So, more than likely, your stock price will go up. So, we\u2019re trying to balance between what the organization is capable of doing, what the infrastructure allows to do. And again, on the infrastructure side, once we get the 120 million day plan in, plus some of things we\u2019re doing next year, a lot of that is basically solved. So then it\u2019s just adding on, and we\u2019ve got a plan to do that and it looks really good.", "So, really it becomes, at that point in time, what we can do organizationally. And let me tell you, Ray Walker and his team up there, Joe Frantz, as Jeff talked about, this guy is a superstar, and we\u2019re glad to have him. He fits right into the organization. Scott Roy is a terrific young man that is really just a star when it comes to being able to look at things more from the environmental regulatory side, which I think will really help us. But still, Ray Walker, John Applegat, Gorsky, Matt Curry, rest of these guys, are just doing a terrific job up there. So I\u2019m really getting more and more confident, I think what do we have now, Jeff, 180\u2026", "Jeff L. Ventura", "Yup", "John H. Pinkerton", "", "190 people out there. This whole thing with the recycling came out of all that. There was a lot of testing. A lot of people worked on that, did really a good job from that group. So, we\u2019re really building the infrastructure, these custom-built rigs we\u2019ve got. As Rodney said, go out and look at the website and see how they walk around the pads, that\u2019s really remarkable.", "So, all that is in preparation of getting the 40 or 50 rigs here in three or four, five years. So, when you take that, you got to couple it over, what\u2019s going to be, how can we make our shareholders the biggest winners? And so that we tweak with that all the time, and in terms of how fast we should go.", "And the good news is, from all this modeling, is we believe and again, a lot of it has to do with gas prices, that between asset sales if you just look over the next five years, if you take asset sales that we think we can accomplish and the saving except to do any acquisitions, we won\u2019t have to issue any equity. That we can do this with our existing equity base, and the good news is, for the shareholders is, is that all the upside that Jeff\u2019s talking about, it\u2019ll accrue to all of us.", "And when I say all of us, I\u2019m still the largest individual shareholder, and I\u2019m a pig, and I want it all for myself. I don\u2019t want to share it, quite frankly, with a bunch of foreign company joint venture partners, or I don\u2019t want to share with a bunch of new shareholders, unless I absolutely have to. So, and that\u2019s as about as blunt as I can say it, okay?", "Monroe Helm \u2013 CM Energy Partners", "Well, I appreciate the answer. And I think that\u2019s what could shovel off from some of the other unconventional players, and the sell-side hasn\u2019t figured out yet that there\u2019s a lot of dilution that still has to occur for some of these shale plays to get done. But your measured pace is going to keep you from doing that. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ve got a question for, I guess, maybe for Rodney any of you all. But it really has to do with the change in the way reserves can be reported at the end of this year, and whether or not you all have decided to report 2P and 3P reserves. And if not, why you would not?", "John H. Pinkerton", "", "Monroe, I\u2019ll take a shot at that. Range Resources and the rest of the industry are all kind of running around with chickens with their heads cut off is the best way and trying to figure out what to do. A couple of things I think are important to note is that while the rules have, quote, changed there\u2019s a lot of unknowns in those rules that people are trying to figure out. And if you go to the SEC and ask them questions, they don\u2019t even know.", "So, Alan Farquharson, who is our Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering, and is just brilliant when it comes to this kind of stuff, has talked to a lot of the chief reservoir engineers in these other companies. And they\u2019re all trying to figure out how to do all this within the context and there\u2019s a lot of questions being asked to the SEC and we\u2019re getting a lot of shrugs there. So, all I can tell you is, we don\u2019t know yet.", "And quite frankly, I think it\u2019s a pretty material thing, and we\u2019ll answer that question in December, and we\u2019re going to go to our Board, and get whatever we do, it\u2019s going to be discussed and fully vetted at the Board. We\u2019re just not going to make that decision ourselves. More than likely, just to give you at least my view of it is, the Range way is to take it is to go slower versus faster in all this. And we\u2019re going to continue to be very disciplined in terms of how we look at reserves, irrespective of some of the new rules and the vagaries that go along with that.", "And my hope is, is that the rest of the industry takes a very disciplined approach at it. I\u2019m a little concerned that they\u2019re not for reasons that people can speculate of, but my hope is that the industry takes a very disciplined approach. If you look what happened in Canada, when they did this a moon or two ago, it was a little bit of a chaotic event. So we\u2019re a little concerned there, but and we\u2019ve looked at that, and so hopefully, that answers your question, but the blunt answer is, we don\u2019t know yet.", "Monroe Helm \u2013 CM Energy Partners", "Okay, just as a follow-on, not to dominate this. But from your understanding of the rules, would you have to demonstrate that you had the cash flow to be able to develop these 2 and 3P reserves, or some way to finance them, before you could put \u2018em on the books?", "John H. Pinkerton", "", "Well, again, the rules are vague. I can tell you one damn thing, that at Range Resources, we\u2019re not going to put things on the books unless we have a very good idea that we\u2019re going to drill. Because I\u2019m the one and Roger and I have to sign these little forms that, if you screw up, you go to jail, so I don\u2019t care what, quote, the engineers tell me, but we\u2019re only going to put things in the engineering report that we are pretty damn convinced that we\u2019re going to drill up in a reasonable period of time.", "Monroe Helm \u2013 CM Energy Partners", "Okay, thanks for the answers, and great results.", "John H. Pinkerton", "", "Thanks.", "Jeff L. Ventura", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Tudor Pickering Holt. Please proceed with your question.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "", "Good afternoon, Joe pretty well and our team does too just can\u2019t agree more with the good hire there. As you think about, just one quick question on third quarter and then fourth quarter kind of realizations in the Marcellus for gas and liquids, and as the MarkWest processing ramps up, I mean, how does that change, what was it currently, and then how does that change?", "John H. Pinkerton", "David, there\u2019s, as you can imagine, there\u2019s a whole lot of moving parts there. And let me give you a little bit of perspective in that. Right now, a fair amount of our gas is being processed in the southwest through a refrigeration plant, which is, it doesn\u2019t have the ability to strip out as much of the liquid that the cryogenic plant does. So, once the cryogenic plant comes on-line, we will be able to receive a lot more money for those liquids than we have previously, which will be an uptick in the realizations that we\u2019re going to get from the Marcellus. So, that\u2019s kind of the big picture.", "If you think about what happens is, let me just kind of go through it again the way I think through it, which is pretty simple, is that when we take the gas through the plant, they\u2019re going to strip the liquids out, not at the cryogenic plant. We\u2019ll strip a bigger piece of out, and be able to get more money for that. And obviously, liquids today are, on a relative value, much more valuable than nat gas. So, the more liquids you can take out, you get paid for them. So it\u2019s a relative, it\u2019s a huge high grade given the difference in what you\u2019re getting paid per btu for gas versus liquids.", "So, that\u2019s the first thing, the second thing is, is once the gas, so once you strip out the liquids, the gas still has a relatively high btu factor, and under our gas contracts, and the way we sell our gas, we will get credit. We have been, and we\u2019ll continue to get credit for the btus. We\u2019re selling btus, not just selling mcfs, so that\u2019s the other thing. So, basically three things: one, you get your raw gas, then you get your btu uplift, and then you get your liquid uplift.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "So with a 40 barrels per million yield kind of declines off the 10 barrels per million be a reasonable assumption, and kind of 40 to 50% of crude oil price realizations be good long term?", "John H. Pinkerton", "Well, to give you a rough idea, the gas that goes through the plant, through the cryogenic plant, once it gets up and running, it will be about 75 to a dollar relative increase, versus Henry Hub.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "", "Okay. Yeah, I was just trying to model out liquids separately, so as we change oil and gas prices, we get that real uplift in the higher oil well. But we can talk about it off-line, if I want to try to break that out.", "John H. Pinkerton", "", "Sure.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "", "The other question, talking about acquisition opportunities, it seems like there\u2019s going to be some assets for sale in the Nora area. Is there any interest at all in adding acreage, or adding producing assets around Nora?", "John H. Pinkerton", "", "Great question. We have an interest in acquiring assets, and Chad his team continue to look at things all the time. Life\u2019s become a little bit more difficult for them, because obviously, they\u2019re challenged in terms of, now we got the little turbo charger from the Marcellus, and the returns from that. So, that makes it a little tougher in terms of buying things that we think are going to be NAV-accretive on a per share basis.", "That being said, if we can find high quality assets in our core areas, and clearly, Nora\u2019s one of our core areas, we\u2019re going to take a hard look at. The other question is, can we buy it at a price that we think is accretive to our shareholders. And what I mean there is, is that, if we go out buy something like we have over the last five or six years, now, we\u2019ll fund the equity piece of that. I mean, the equity piece of that, through issuing equity, more than likely to the market. So, then it has to survive that rigorous analysis.", "So, therefore, it\u2019s a challenge, but the way we look at it, if it\u2019s in our core area, and we think we can acquire it a reasonable price, and we feel like it\u2019s accretive to shareholders, sure, I think that\u2019s what you pay us for to do, is to do those types of things. And then the question is, can we buy it a price that works for us, given all the vagaries, and people, future year gas prices and what-not. But as those assets come on the market, we\u2019ll take hard look at it.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "Okay.", "John H. Pinkerton", "", "I mean, we\u2019re looking at things in the Barnett now, and we\u2019re looking at things and in the Marcellus right now. So, but yeah, I think that being said, we haven\u2019t done an acquisition for nearly 10 years. So, again, I think, to gives you a little bit of an idea, we\u2019re going to be really disciplined. And again, it all gets backs to what really matters to us, is that that\u2019s really the per share or the stock price, and being the biggest producer, or having the most rigs, or having the biggest acreage position, all of that kind of gobbledygook just absolutely means nothing to us.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "", "Okay. And as you think about the leasing decision for equity, it\u2019s small dollar amounts but how do you think about using your equity? Or what\u2019s the, I guess, the seller of the acreage, are they asking for equity as opposed to cash? Or how are you thinking about issuing equity for acreage in the Marcellus?", "John H. Pinkerton", "", "Yeah, it\u2019s a great question. In most cases, the sellers are asking for it, and so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve done it. And in each of the cases, let me just back up in the Marcellus, we\u2019re not buying what I call any trend acreage in the Marcellus, haven\u2019t been for almost two years now. Everything we\u2019re buying is very targeted, it\u2019s in something that we have a very clear view geologically on what we\u2019re doing. And it\u2019s stuff that we think is very promising in terms of the potential.", "And we don\u2019t own all of the acreage in all the areas that we think are highly prospective, and we don\u2019t have enough money to acquire all that acreage, quite frankly, and we never will acquire it all. But in and around some of our very, very, very key areas, that\u2019s where we\u2019re spending our money. And the good news is, with this, the one good thing about the recession has been is that prices, acreage prices have cooled off quite a bit, and we\u2019ve been able to pick up a fair amount of acreage, again, right in between a bunch of key leases, and what-not, and picking up the acreage. And so that\u2019s been one good part about it.", "And the other thing about Appalachia that is different than, let\u2019s say, the Barnett Shale play in particular, is that, there aren\u2019t 20,000-acre ranches in Pennsylvania. These are relatively small farms, in most cases. So, the leasing is very, very tedious, takes a lot of land people. And that\u2019s why our acreage position and we\u2019ve built this acreage position over a 25-year period. We were fortunate to have some acreage in the beginning of the play that just happened to be in the middle of it where we\u2019ve built on extensively in that, and we\u2019ll continue to do that.", "The other thing we\u2019re doing is that we\u2019re discussing with a number of different Marcellus players out there about trading acreage and they try to block up. They block up their positions, we block up ours, because clearly, that\u2019s beneficial from a drilling and operating expense perspective. So, we\u2019re doing some of those, we\u2019ve done two or three so far, and we\u2019ve got two or three more in the works that we\u2019re working on.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "", "All right. Thanks, all.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. We are nearing the end of today\u2019s conference. We\u2019ll go to Marshall Carver of Capital One Southcoast for our final question.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "", "Yes. Thank you. One question, you added 40 million to the acreage budget, and haven\u2019t changed your 900,000-acre position in a while. Is that $40 million increase going mostly to the Marcellus, or are you adding some in the Barnett too, or just trying to get feel for where that increase in acreage is going?", "John H. Pinkerton", "", "Most of it\u2019s going in the Marcellus, but some of it\u2019s going in the Barnett. More than 50% of it\u2019s going in the Marcellus. So, in terms of updating the numbers, we haven\u2019t updated the numbers in a while, and  no real reason other than and I think the key thing is that, in some cases, we\u2019re trading acreage.", "We end up with a few more acres, and they end up with a few less acres, depending on the relative quality of the acreage. The other thing is, as we continue to drill wells, we continue to high-grade it. I think we actually, just last week or a week before, actually sold off , I don\u2019t know 10 or 20,000 acres in an area that we just didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get to for 10-plus years. So, we actually sold that off and that money will be recycled into some of our, what we consider our A-areas too.", "So the acreage number\u2019s going to go up and down could go down, could go up, could go sideways for a while, unless we do something that\u2019s pretty material. And we do from time to time have people with large blocks of acreage that have come to us and because we are the pioneer of the play and they see our results, and how well we\u2019ve done it, they\u2019ve asked us to be their partner. And that\u2019s challenging, because again, if you think through it, I\u2019d rather be spending our talent on acreage, where we get 100% benefit versus acreage where we\u2019re getting, let\u2019s say, half benefit or 60% benefit. Not that we don\u2019t look at those, but we evaluate those as well, so it\u2019s just all that kind of gobbledygook together.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "", "Okay, thank you. And are you adding sort of equally in northeast and southwest PA, or could you give any color on that?", "John H. Pinkerton", "", "We\u2019re adding some in the northeast, but primarily in the southwest.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "Okay, thank you.", "John H. Pinkerton", "And just to answer that, Marshall, the reason is that is obviously, we\u2019ve drilled more wells there. And again, not the smartest bulb in the package here, but when you drill a good well, and if there\u2019s some acreage that, we\u2019ve got most of it tied up, but there may be some of it that needs prospective, so we\u2019ll run out and probably pick that up. And again, trying to continue to block up the acreage, and key again, one of the keys is blocking up the acreage, because it allows you to do the recycling, like Jeff talked about.", "It\u2019s cheaper in terms of roads and pipelines, and all the other stuff. And we\u2019ve really encouraged all the operators in the basin to really block up, because we think that\u2019s really environmentally, it\u2019s the best way, and it\u2019s going to drive up the production the quickest in the basin as well, in terms of pipeline and infrastructure. So it\u2019s all part of the master plan.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Pinkerton for his closing remarks.", "John H. Pinkerton", "Well, thank you all for being on the call. I think we ran over a bit, and I apologize for that. Just some great questions, and we try to be as transparent as we can at Range. If you didn\u2019t get an answer to your question, or if you thought our answer wasn\u2019t clear enough to you, feel free to call Rodney, and he\u2019ll get you to the right person to get those questions answered for you. We really appreciate the time. I\u2019ll just sign off, given that we\u2019ve run over so much. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "And thanks for your participation today in this conference.

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Thank you. Mr. Waller, you may now begin.", "Rodney Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome. Range reported results for the calendar year 2009 with record production, leading the consensus number and setting a firm platform of continuing growth at low cost with high rates of return for 2010.", "The fourth quarter marked our 28th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. Range has now completed its seven years of quarterly sequential production growth, with 2009 finding and development costs at the lowest in the company\u2019s history. Although we are encouraged with our resource base to continue to grow production and reserves, we are more focused on achieving those targets at an optimum cost structure on a per share basis to maximize shareholder value. I think you will hear those same things reiterated from each of our speakers today.", "On the call with me are John Pinkerton, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Ventura, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Before turning the call over to John, I\u2019d like to cover a few administrative items. First, we did file our 10-Q, 10-K with the SEC this morning. It\u2019s now available on the home page of our website, or you can access it using the SEC\u2019s EDGAR system. In addition, we posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDA, cash margin, and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today. Tables are also posted on the website that will give you the detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter.", "Secondly, we will be participating in several conferences in the coming weeks. Check our website for a complete listing for the next several months. Jeff Ventura just spoke at Enercom\u2019s Conference in San Francisco last week, and his remarks are still on the website. Next week we will be attending the Simmons Energy Conference in Las Vegas, the JPMorgan High Yield Conference in Miami, Thomas Weisel Partners Energy Conference is Denver, and we will finish up March with the Raymond James Conference in Orlando, the Wells Fargo Energy Forum in Boston, and finally see everyone in New Orleans at the Howard Weil Energy Conference at the end of the month.", "Now let me turn the call over to John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Rodney. Before Roger reviews the financial results, I will review some of the key accomplishments for 2009. Overall, we are very pleased with 2009 results. On a year-over-year basis, production rose 13%, beating the high end of our guidance.", "Fourth quarter production averaged $457 million a day, a record high for Range. It also represented the 28th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. I should note that no other company in our peer group, to our knowledge, has achieved 28 consecutive quarters of sequential production growth. I believe this is a vivid testimony to the quality of our operating teams we have in each of our divisions.", "At year-end, proved reserves totaled 3.1 Tcfe, an 18% increase over 2008. Reserve replacement was 486% from all sources, including price revisions. Our FD&A costs averaged $1 an Mcf, the lowest in our history. Our drilling program alone delivered 540% reserve replacement at a cost of $0.69 per Mcfe, again the lowest in our history. Based on what we\u2019ve seen today, these look to be some of the results of our peer group.", "We combine excellent growth in production reserves with low finding and development costs. That\u2019s the hard part of our business that combined high growth with low cost. Again, this performance is attributable directly to our very talented technical teams in our divisions. Most importantly, production and reserves per share on a debt adjusted basis again increased over 10%. This marks the fifth consecutive year that we have achieved double-digit production and reserve growth per share.", "In 2009, we completed $219 million of asset sales. Over the last three years, we sold over $0.5 billion of properties. We would believe periodically selling our more mature properties have several benefits. First, it helps focus us on our higher growth opportunities; second, provides additional capital for our high return activity; third, helps high grade our property base; and fourth, asset sales reduce the need to issue equity.", "From a financial perspective, we continue our disciplined and simple approach. Total debt declined by $83 million in 2009, and we ended the year with approximately $1 billion of liquidity under our bank line. As the largest individual shareholder of Range, I\u2019m very pleased that the average shares outstanding rose only 1.8% during 2009.", "I\u2019m also pleased that with some of the things that we didn\u2019t do in 2009. In particular, we didn\u2019t complete a single producing property acquisition during the year, while we continue to evaluate a number of many opportunities. We concluded that none of them were accretive on an NAV per share basis. We also considered but did not pursue a joint venture of our Marcellus Shale acreage.", "While shale play joint ventures seem to be the current rage, we view them simply as asset sales. Given that we believe that Marcellus has some of the best, if not the best, economics in the E&P business today, we are a buyer, not a seller of the Marcellus. Our strategy has been to sell our higher cost, lower growth, more mature properties and recycle the proceeds into our lower cost, higher return projects like the Marcellus, Barnett and Nora.", "I would not completely rule out Range doing a Marcellus JV. If we did one, it would have to be at a substantially higher price than any of the previous deals, including the recently announced Anadarko-Mitsui joint venture. I want to keep \u2013 at the end of the day, I think it\u2019s our job is to keep all Marcellus resource potential for Range\u2019s shareholders. In addition, diluting our NAV in resource potential per share, JVs also dilute our technical teams.", "At Range, we own roughly 100% working interest in nearly all of our Marcellus acreage and have an average royalty of roughly 15%. So when our technical teams go out and drill Marcellus well, we gain 85% of the production reserves and cash flow. By entering [ph] into a JV, our technical teams would have to drill significantly more wells to achieve this high net result. At Range, we prefer to keep things simple also. Having a partner in thousands of future Marcellus wells that we anticipate drilling over the next five to 10 years will maturely complicate our business and make us less efficient.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over Roger to discuss our financial results. Roger?", "Roger Manny", "Thank you, John. Range ended 2009 on a high note with a very solid fourth quarter operating and financial performance. Cash flow for the fourth quarter exceeded last year\u2019s even though oil and gas prices were lower. We lost significant production to asset sales during the year, but oil and gas production still set a new record high for the fourth quarter and year. Direct operating cost remains well below last year, and our record drill bit growth did not come with the expense of the balance sheet or the shareholders, as we ended the quarter and the year with less debt, more liquidity, and a share count very close to where we started.", "Oil and gas sales for the fourth quarter, including all settled derivatives, came to $277 million, a 9% increase from last year, as our increase in production won out over the 4% decline in realized price. Cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $188 million, up 14% from last year and up 10% from last quarter. Cash flow per share for the quarter was $1.18, $0.02 per share higher than the analyst consensus estimate of $1.16.", "Quarterly EBITDAX was $215 million, 12% higher than last year. Cash margins for the fourth quarter were $4.34 per Mcfe, and that\u2019s the third consecutive quarter of improved margins. Year-over-year, while prices declined by $0.27 per Mcfe, cash margins only declined by $0.07, thanks to reductions in operating costs. Fourth quarter cash direct operating expense was $0.75 per Mcfe, 20% below the fourth quarter of last year.", "And to further illustrate our lower operating cost on an absolute dollar basis, direct operating cost was almost $3 million less in the fourth quarter of this year than last year even though production was 13% higher. Expect directing operating cost to hover around the $0.75 per Mcfe level for the first quarter of next year until the impact of our pending asset sales take hold, after which direct operating cost per Mcfe should drop into the mid-to-high $0.60 range.", "Reflecting lower oil and gas prices, production and ad valorem taxes for the fourth quarter were lower on an absolute and unit cost basis, coming in at $0.21 per Mcfe versus $0.27 last year. Exploration expense for the fourth quarter, excluding stock-based compensation, provided a pleasant surprise of just over $9 million compared to the $11.5 million last year.", "Exploration expenses tend to be a bit front-loaded in a new budget year. So looking ahead into the first quarter of 2010, exploration expense is likely return to the $17 million to $19 million range. This is due to increased seismic purchases, delayed rentals, and exploratory drilling.", "General and administrative expense adjusted for non-cash stock comp and severance accrual totaled $0.50 for the fourth quarter, down $0.03 from last year just as we saw a spike in G&A during the third quarter due to severance obligations associated with the closing of our Houston office, we expect another spike in the first quarter of 2010 related to severance cost associated with the pending sale of our Ohio shallow tight gas sand asset. First quarter 2010 G&A, including severance, should be in the $0.65 to $0.67 per Mcfe range, before retreating back to the low $0.50 range for the rest of the year.", "Interest expense on an absolute basis was flat with the prior two quarters, thanks to lower debt levels. And on an Mcfe basis, interest expenses drifted down, tracking the increase in production with interest per Mcfe for the quarter of $0.73. It\u2019s worth noting that following the Ohio asset sale, Range will have 90% of its debt funded at a fixed rate of 7.4%. This positions the company well should interest rates begin to rise.", "Fourth quarter abandonment and impairment of unproved properties totaled $29 million, which includes impairments associated with the closure of our Houston office and abandonment of certain non-core unproved acreage in the Barnett Shale. Going forward, we anticipate that quarterly unproved impairment will range between $14 million and $16 million per quarter.", "Before we get to the bottom line income figures for the quarter, I\u2019d like to explain some of the unusual income and expense items flowing through the income statement. On the revenue side, we booked a $10.4 million gain on the cash sale of non-core undeveloped acreage in Pennsylvania, which is excluded from our non-GAAP adjusted earnings.", "This item helped to offset some of the non-cash expense and impairment items, such as the $10 million charge taken in connection with our soon-to-be decommissioned Marcellus refrigeration gas processing plant, a $900 million proved property impairment on a producing deal included in the Ohio asset sale package, and a $6 million non-cash write-down of our equity investment in our Appalachian drilling company.", "While unscheduled charges to earnings are never welcome, the charge for decommissioning the Marcellus refrigeration plant had a silver lining, which is we need the physical space the refrigeration plant is sitting on to construct and expansion to our cryogenic processing capacity.", "The good news here is that, one, the Marcellus play is exceeding our expectations with production ramping up faster than we expected when we first placed the refrigeration plant in service. Two, the decommissioning means of superior extraction efficiency of the cryogenic plant will now be realized sooner. And three, our midstream partnership with MarkWest is working well, allowing us to expand capacity faster and more efficiently than we could do on our own.", "Another special time may be found embedded in the non-cash deferred tax line of the income statement. Because of our success in the Marcellus, we are projecting a shift in revenue from the Southwest states to the Appalachian states, particularly to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.", "This projected change in income apportionment will only modestly increase our tax rate on an ongoing basis, but it does require us to reset our deferred tax provision on the balance sheet and run the change through the income statement in the fourth quarter. Result of this reset is a non-cash deferred tax expense totaling $16 million that reflects the sum of all projected future tax severances between the old estimated income apportionment and the new estimate.", "We paid $354,000 in cash paid income taxes, and we received $1 million federal income tax refund in \u201909. On an ongoing basis next year, our all-in tax rate is expected to be approximately 38%, with approximately $1 million of our tax liability payable in cash.", "Year-end is when we update the estimate of our tax net operating loss carry-forward. And at December 31, \u201909, our regular NOL carry-forward is $322 million, and our A&P NOL carry-forward is $259 million. These tax yields combined with approximately $526 million in previously capitalized intangible drilling cost deductions positioned Range well to manage through any potential changes in the tax curve.", "Depletion, depreciation, and amortization during the fourth quarter was impacted by some of these unusual items, particularly the decommissioning of the refrigeration plant. This non-recurring charge combined with the 900,000 property impairment added $0.27 to the fourth quarter DD&A rate, which pushed the rate to $2.48 per Mcfe. The most important component of the DD&A rate, however, is our depletion rate. And depletion for the fourth quarter was $2.00 Mcfe compared to $2.05 last year and $2.25 last quarter.", "The decline in depletion rate is significant for two reasons. One, the signals are improving drill bit capital efficiency, which is driving the rate down even while the rate is being pushed up by subtracting the low depletion rate legacy assets we\u2019ve been selling. Two, depletion reduction, unlike most companies, has not caused by ceiling test write-downs of producing properties. The depletion rate should remain relatively constant next quarter, bringing the all-in recurring DD&A rate to approximately $2.25 per Mcfe.", "As has been the case all year, our quarterly mark-to-market hedge accounting losses pushed us into a pretax loss position for the quarter just under $3 million. This quarter\u2019s non-cash pretax derivative mark-to-market loss totaled $33 million. Because of the previously mentioned non-cash deferred tax apportionment true-up, the $3 million GAAP pretax loss turned into a $17 million after-tax net total loss.", "The fourth quarter earnings calculated using the analyst consensus methodology was $52 million or $0.32 per fully diluted share. This is $0.05 higher than the analyst consensus estimate of $0.27. Please remember, the Range Resources website contains a full reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures mentioned on this call, including non-GAAP earnings, cash flow, EBITDAX and cash margins.", "Before discussing recent additions to our hedging position and the condition of the year-end balance sheet, I\u2019ll recap some key metrics for the 2009 fiscal year. Our own gas failed, including all derivative settlements for the full year of \u201909 of just over $1 billion trailed the $1.2 billion of \u201908. Our operating team held up their end of the bargain for the 13% year-over-year drill bit production increase despite significant asset sales. But with the oil and gas prices down 25% in \u201909, the decline in revenue was inevitable.", "EBITDAX for all of \u201909 was $782 million, and cash flow for the year was $674 million. Cash flow per share for the year was $4.25, $0.12 higher than the analyst consensus estimate of $4.13. GAAP net loss for the year was $54 million, which included $118 million at pretax non-cash derivative mark-to-market losses. And adjusted earnings calculated using the analysts\u2019 methodology for the year were $165 million or $1.04 per fully diluted share adjusted.", "Range continues to build its hedge position in 2010 and 2011, with new collars added just over the past few months. We now have approximately 76% of our 2010 gas production hedged at a floor of $5.53 per Mmbtu and a cap of $7.23. We also have 20% of our oil hedged with collars at $75 by $93.75 per barrel. For 2011, we now have approximately 23% of our 2011 gas production hedged, with collars at $6 by $7.24 per Mmbtu.", "As for our balance sheet, we spoke increasingly this year about our disciplined approach of capital spending and the improving capital and operating efficiency of our company. The year-end results verify that we have indeed walked the walk regarding these claims. First, we ended the year with $83 million less debt than we started despite posting 13% growth unaided by acquisitions, keeping our promise to live within cash flow and asset sale proceeds.", "Second, we issued only a modest amount of equity to our employee benefit plans and several small transactions as currency for selected Marcellus acreage whose owners desire our stock. Third, we\u2019ve reduced direct operating expense by 17% on an Mcfe basis, and even the 13% production growth we reduced 6% on an absolute dollar basis. Fourth, we\u2019ve turned in company record low all-in finding and development costs, whether one uses the new SEC reserve rules or the old ones.", "Fifth, thanks to our low cost structure, we incurred massive declines in oil and gas prices without the balance sheet being ravaged by ceiling test write-downs. And sixth, we\u2019ve retained our 26-member bank group and $1.5 billion borrowing base through a tough bank market in significant asset sales, ending the year with almost $1 billion in available liquidity.", "In summary, the financial view forward into 2010 is as promising as if you go\u00a0backward into 2009, with our pending Ohio asset sale potentially pre-funding our anticipated capital spending gap and serving to further reduce our operating costs.", "And John, I\u2019ll turn it back to you.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Roger. Good report. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff Venture to review our operations. Jeff?", "Jeff Ventura", "Thanks, John. I\u2019ll start the operations update with the Marcellus Shale. This time last year, our plan was to exit 2009 with net production from the Marcellus Shale from 80 million to 100 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We hit the high end of our guidance and we exited just over 100 million per day net. Today we are producing about 115 million per day net. We currently have 31 horizontal wells that have been drilled and are not yet online. Six of these wells have been completed and are waiting on hook-up and the remainder are waiting on completion. All of the wells will be completed within the next 90 days.", "Our plan is to exit 2010 at a net rate of 182 million per day from the Marcellus Shale and to exit 2011 at a net rate of 360 million to 400 million per day. Give n our large acreage position and our net resource potential of 18 to 25 Bcfe, I believe that we can surpass 1 Bcf per day net production from the Marcellus Shale to grow towards 2 Bcf per day in the future.", "In the Southwest part of the play, Range now has 40 horizontal wells with at least 120 days of production, with the oldest horizontal well having approximately 2.5 years of production history. We expect the average recovery of these wells to be 4.4 Bcfe gross. Zero time plot for these wells is on our website. We\u2019ve also shown zero time plots for all of our horizontal wells by program year. It\u2019s interesting to note that from 2007 to 2009, our effective horizontal lateral length has ranged from approximately 2,200 feet to 2,800 feet. And for the last two years, we\u2019ve been averaging eight frac stages per well.", "Beginning in August of 2009, we\u2019ve began experimenting with longer laterals in additional frac stages. We now have drilled and completed 21 horizontal wells with lateral lengths of up to 4,100 feet and is frac-ed in with up to 14 stages. We have drilled an additional 10 wells with laterals ranging up to 5,000 feet and (inaudible) frac-ed in with up to 17 stages.", "With the completions that we\u2019ve run to date, I believe that the Marcellus has the best economics in any large scale repeatable claim in the US. This is in contrast to other shale plays where typically they took a long time in long laterals and lot of frac stages to make the economics of the other plays work. This speaks to the quality of the rock in the Marcellus.", "However, as stronger the economics have been with Range\u2019s wells in the Marcellus to date, we believe significant upside exists through longer laterals and additional frac stages. Typically longer laterals and additional frac stages would significantly improve the economics of the other shale plays such as the Fayetteville, Woodford and Bakken.", "It\u2019s interesting \u2013 or in addition to the great job the team has done in discovering, delineating and ramping up production in Southwest Pennsylvania, Range is now delineating and in the process of setting the stage for a ramp-up in the Northeast. Both of our first two horizontal wells in Lycoming County averaged about 13.5 million per day each, during a seven-day production test against simulated line pressure. Deep wells would be shut in and production will begin for Range later this year from Lycoming County.", "Currently we are running 13 drilling rigs in the play. Plans are to add more rigs in the fourth quarter of 2010 and exit the year with approximately 16 rigs. During 2010, we expect to drill and case 150 horizontal Marcellus Shale wells. During 2011, we plan on increasing the rig count and exiting 2011 with approximately 24 drilling rigs.", "We also drilled and completed our first horizontal Upper Devonian Shale well testing key shale intervals above the Marcellus. We are currently testing the well and initial results are encouraging. We\u2019ve also drilled and cased our first Utica Shale well, which is below the Marcellus, and plan on fracking it in about a month. Early indications are encouraging as well.", "The build-out of the Marcellus midstream infrastructure in the Southwest is progressing on schedule. Gross cryogenic processing capacity increased 155 million per day during the quarter, with startup of a new 120 million per day cryogenic plant at the MarkWest facility in Southwest Pennsylvania. And an additional 30 million per day of processing capacity is expected to be added in the third quarter of 2010 and another 150 million per day has been ordered for startup in the first quarter of 2011, increasing gross cryogenic processing capacity to 335 million per day.", "In addition, we have tap capacity of 160 million per day of dry gas in the Southwest, with 20 million per day of gathering and compression capacity at this time. The gathering and compressing capacity will increase to 55 million per day by late 2011. Plans are to start dry gas production in Lycoming County late this year. Tap capacity in Lycoming County will be 350 million per day. Initial gathering and compression capacity will be 40 million per day, increasing to 120 million per day by late 2011.", "In total, by year-end 2011, we will have gathering and compression capacity to cruise 400 million per day of gas in the Southwest and 120 million per day in the Northeast, for a grant total of 520 million per day. We plan to grow this with time as Range continues to develop its acreage position.", "Let me briefly update you on our other two major properties. Staying in the Appalachian Basin, I\u2019ll discuss Nora first. Successful drilling continues in all three horizons, coal bed methane, tight gas sand and the Huron Shale. In the Huron Shale, we\u2019ve now drilled and completed 23 horizontal wells throughout the field. Based on the performance of the wells, the vast majority of the acreage block appears to be prospective.", "We\u2019ve also drilled and completed four horizontal wells in the Berea sands, five horizontal wells in the Big Lime. In aggregate, we believe there is about 1.5 Tcf of resource potential in these horizons net to Range. All of this comes at three well F&D about $1.25 per Mcf at very low LOE about $0.60 per Mcf.", "In addition, we still have over 3,000 coal bed methane wells to drill, including infill wells. F&D for these wells is less than $0.90 per Mcf. Today we are producing about 61 million per day net from Virginia and about 4 million per day from West Virginia. In the Barnett, although we\u2019ve decreased our rig count from about six rigs at the beginning of 2009 to one currently, we grew production 25% year-over-year. In 2010, we plan on running one to two rigs.", "Even at this stage, we expect the growth production 8% year-over-year and expect to average about 132 million per day for 2010. This is an excellent job by our Barnett team. The rates of return on the Barnett wells are still very good. Even at $5 gas, they are still 32%. We still have many locations to drill in the Barnett. But fortunately, we don\u2019t have any significant drilling commitments. The bulk of our acreage is in the core of where many locations are largely held by production.", "Let me now take a few minutes to discuss our 2010 budget. We plan to spend $950 million this year. 77% will be allocated to the Marcellus Shale division. This is a significant increase from last year when 52% was spent there. The increase is a direct result of the strong economics and growth of this project. It also reflects the fact that in the rest of the company we either own the minerals or the vast majority of our acreage is held by production. So we have the flexibility to throttle back spending there and focus our capital in the Marcellus.", "The breakout of spending by division is 77% Marcellus, 11% Southwest, 7% Midcontinent, and 5% Appalachian. The Southwest Division is primarily Barnett drilling in the core part of the play, coupled with some strong oil deepening [ph] in Conger. The Midcontinent is primarily focused on the St. Louis, where early indications are the economics have the potential to rival that of any play.", "The Appalachian drilling is on Nora. Of the $950 million budget, $700 million will be spent on drilling and $190 million on land. This is 96% of the total. The remaining 4% will be spent on seismic pipelines and facilities. So as good as Range has been in the past, we should be even better in the future. The F&D cost for all three major properties, the Marcellus, the Barnett Shale and Nora, ranges from about $1.00 to $1.50, and the LOEs for all three properties are very low.", "It\u2019s also important that two of our top three projects are in the Appalachian Basin, where the gas price has been better than anywhere else in the US. Range has consistently delivered top tier organic production and reserve growth, with one of the lowest cost structures in the business. This is a direct result of our simple strategy of strong organic growth at top quartile cost structure or better, and in addition, consistently building and migrating our inventory coupled with one of the best teams in the industry.", "We believe Range today has more upside and lower risk upside than in any time in the company\u2019s history. With our inventory, we have the opportunity to grow the company more than 10-fold, primarily from the Marcellus Shale, more in the Barnett Shale. We believe our excellent organic growth combined with an excellent cost structure will result in continuing to create strong shareholder returns over time.", "Back to you, John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Jeff. Terrific report. Now let\u2019s turn to 2010. Looking to 2010, it\u2019s going to continue to be a challenging but also an exciting year for Range. Obviously the macroeconomic climate and the low commodity prices will be challenging, but we are extremely excited about the opportunities before us. Now, regarding Marcellus Shale, our goal in 2010 is continue to ramp up our drilling and double our production.", "In 2010, we are planning to drill 150 horizontal wells and anticipating exiting the year at 180 [ph] to 200 million per day net. In addition, we focus on continuing to maximize our drilling returns, as Jeff mentioned, experimenting with our lateral lengths and the number of frac stages. The good news is that we are off to a great start. Again, as Jeff mentioned, the drilling results continue to exceed our expectations. Our first two horizontal wells in Northeast PA tested for over 13 million a day on a seven-day test. These are clearly outstanding results. And we are very excited about it.", "In addition, while early, we are encouraged by the first Upper Devonian test and our first initial Utica test. In addition, the Marcellus infrastructure is proceeding as planned, as the cryogenic gas processing capacity is now at 155 million a day, heading into 335 million a day by early 2011. As Jeff again mentioned, on the dry gas side, we are making considerable progress on the infrastructure as well in terms of the dry gas side.", "Regarding the Marcellus Shale play, we discovered what many believe is a giant natural gas field. When you look back in history, there are only a handful of companies of Range\u2019s size that have discovered and developed fields at this potential magnitude. We\u2019ve not only moved from the R&D side to the development side, we have captured a lot of the resource potential by aggregating a leasehold position of approximately 900,000 net acres in the fairway of the play.", "Again, our acreage position in the outline of the play is materially higher than that, but we high graded to 900,000 net acres in what we consider to be the fairway or the core of the play. This is tremendous for Range and its shareholders to put the 900,000 net fairway acres in perspective. The three largest producers in the Barnett Shale play own in aggregate approximately 900,000 net acres in the high graded portion of the Barnett.", "These three companies, Devon, XTO and Chesapeake, have a collective market cap of $73 billion. Given that the Barnett Shale play is the largest producing gas field in the US, this illustrates the opportunity we have before us. The important thing that all of our shareholders should focus on in particular is the per-share potential impact at the Marcellus Shale play can have on Range. This is why we say at Range we care about our stock price, not our market capitalization.", "Now I want to turn to reserves for a moment. There had been much discussion regarding the new SEC rule for booking proved reserves. To provide a clear picture on the impact of the rule changes, we provided information to what our finding cost would have been under the old methodology. We also provided specific information as to how many Marcellus offset drilling locations we booked versus our producing well count.", "We did this to continue our transparent approach and to indicate that we didn\u2019t go out of our way to report all the Marcellus drilling locations we could have. Our goal is to consistently grow reserves over many years. Given this reasonable to conservative approach and our large resource potential, I\u2019m confident we will be able to report low finding costs \u2013 finding and development costs not just for 2009, but for many years to come.", "I\u2019ll now provide some additional details on 2010. As mentioned in our release, our capital budget for 2010 is $950 million. Roughly 90% of the budget is attributable to the Barnett, Nora, and the Marcellus. We currently anticipate that 74% of the budget will be used to drill 338 net wells while the remaining $250 million will be used for acreage, seismic and pipeline infrastructure. We are targeting 12% production growth with this budget. The 2010 production growth target would have been 19% pro forma for the New York and Ohio asset sales.", "Looking to 2011, we are looking at production growth in the 25% area. And again, as Jeff alluded to in his remarks, we continue to ramp up \u2013 we ramp up the Marcellus in all the core plays and anticipate that the rated growth will continue to accelerate. For the first quarter of 2010, we\u2019re looking for production to come in at 460 million to 465 million a day. The midpoint represents 11% production growth versus the prior year quarter and its success will represent our 29th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth.", "Roger discussed our outlook for the expense side of the income statement. In particular, I want to discuss lease operating costs. In 2008, our operating cost per Mcf averaged $0.99. In 2009, they dropped 17% to $0.82. In 2010, we are anticipating another 17% drop to $0.68. This reflects an impact of selling our higher cost properties and reinvesting the proceeds in the higher-return, lower-cost properties. As Roger pointed out, in 2009, despite increasing production by 13%, our operating cost per Mcfe declined by 17%. And as a result, our aggregate operating cost in 2009 actually decreased by over $18 million versus 2008.", "Now, getting back to the capital budget, we set the budget at $950 million and, in fact, in an effort to keep spending in line with cash flow and asset sales. Given the high degree of operational control, we can and will remain flexible after the capital budget. The good news is that $5 flat NYMEX gas prices. Our drilling projects in the Marcellus, Nora and Barnett, all generate over 30% rate of return.", "Currently we have natural gas hedges in place covering approximately 75% of our anticipated 2010 gas production at an average ore price of $5.50 per Mcfe, $0.50 higher than the $5 flat I just mentioned. As a result, having executed a definitive agreement on our Ohio property sale, which is expected to close by the end of March and given our 2010 hedge position, I feel very good about our 3010 capital program and our ability to fund it without taxing the balance sheet or diluting our shareholders with a material sale of equity.", "Stepping back and looking at the big picture, assuming current futures market for the natural gas prices and our current capital outlook for the next three years, in 2010, 2011 and 2012, we are in aggregate approximately $1 billion short in terms of projected cash flow versus capital spending for the three-year period in aggregate. Because of the Ohio property sale, we reduced the shortage to slightly less than $700 million. We can easily fund the gap via additional modest asset sales and by modestly increasing debt in relation to stockholders\u2019 equity as we book earnings over the next three years.", "In late 2012, our projections indicate our capital program will be completely still funding to cash flow as company-wide production should be approaching roughly 1 Bcfe per day. The good news is that Range\u2019s current shareholders should receive nearly all this benefit as it doesn\u2019t look like we will need to issue any material amount of equity in the near future, except if we decide to undertake an accretive property acquisition.", "Turning to our stock price for a moment, we are well aware that our stock price is at a high multiples of current cash flow and earnings. When a company the size of Range discovers a giant gas field, it appears to have some of the best economics of any field in North America. It makes sense that we should trade more on an NAV basis versus the current multiple of cash flow or earnings.", "Over time, as we develop the Marcellus, our trading multiples and our NAV per share should move into parity. We have run many NAV models, and we believe that our NAV per share is substantially than our current stock price. As we and other operators de-risk Range\u2019s 900,000 Marcellus fairway acreage position, our NAV will become increasingly clear to the market.", "Let me make a simple NAV case for Range. If you take the $14,000 per net acre that Mitsui recently agreed to pay Anadarko for our third interest in Anadarko\u2019s Marcellus acreage and plot that to our 900,000 net fairway acres, that equates to $12.6 billion. If you then value our \u2013 the proved reserves at the PV-10 value of $6.6 billion based on strip pricing asset close in our earnings release, you get $19.2 billion for both combined.", "Given no value to Range\u2019s other 1.6 million acres outside of the Marcellus fairway and subtract $1.7 billion of debt outstanding at year-end, you come up with well over $100 per share on a diluted share basis. While this is a fairly simple exercise and our NAV model is much more sophisticated, it illustrates the Range\u2019s stock price has a long way to go.", "Lastly, I want to take a moment to review the transformation of Range over the last several years and the impact that will have on capital efficiency and the value of our company. Since January 1, 2008 \u2013 since January 1 of 2008, we have sold our interest in the Fuhrman Mascho Field in West Texas, our New York properties, and we have a definitive agreement to sell our Ohio property. In aggregate, these three areas contain approximately 5,700 wells, and production per well averaged less than 10 Mcf per day per well. In aggregate, these properties represent roughly 50% of our well count, but only approximately 10% of our production and reserves.", "As you can see, once we complete our Ohio sale in March, Range will be a much, much more efficient company with a much higher quality, low cost property base. We have begun to see the benefits of this transition to lower finding cost for 2009 as well as lower operating cost. This will allow us to do more with less. This will \u2013 we will be able to grow our production faster at lower cost. The bottom line, this will have a big positive impact on shareholder value per share.", "Lastly, while we have accomplished much in 2009, I believe that the majority of our assets will benefit 2010 and beyond. As you heard from Jeff, we now have a projects that have 22 to 30 Tcf of net unrisked reserve potential. Finally, I would like to publicly congratulate and thank our talented team of roughly 850 employees for an extremely well \u2013 job well done in 2009. We have set the bar high for 2010, but I\u2019m confident that was the talent, dedication and passion of the Range team we will meet or exceed our goals for the year.", "With that, operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Why don\u2019t we turn the call over to question-and-answers?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Pinkerton. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of David Kistler with Simmons & Company. Please proceed with your question. Your mike is now live.", "David Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company", "Hi, guys. Diving into the northeastern portion for a bit, I want to talk through development plans with the two recent horizontal well results. Little curious about how far apart those two wells were. And then you mentioned in your release pipelines tying in I think at the tail end of 2010 and also in 2011. And so I wanted to think about how rig count was directed there and the number of wells you might be tying in as the pipeline meets the project deadlines.", "Jeff Ventura", "Okay. This is Jeff Ventura. To answer your first question, the wells are approximately 9 miles apart. So they are good ways apart. And again, we\u2019ve drilled other vertical wells in there. So I feel confident about the acreage and that we have really high quality acreage. Let me put a little color on it too. To keep the variables at a minimum back to the \u2013 we drilled a 2,500-foot lateral with eight stages. So it was more standard design. So I think you have the upside there with volume, with longer laterals and more stages and show improvement there. But I couldn\u2019t be happier about our initial results. The pipeline will be there at the end of this year. So what you will see us do this year, of the roughly 150 wells that we will be drilling, 15 to 20 of those are going to be up in the Northeast. And what we will do is both delineate additional acreage, de-risk additional acreage, and have wells ready to tie in when the pipelines get there. You will see production really start right at the tail end of this year, and then you will see a significant ramp-up in drilling curve in 2011.", "David Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Jumping over to Nora just for a second, you guys probably had a little less commentary on that, but I imagine experiencing the same sort of efficiency gains that you are seeing in days to drill and recoveries per well as you work through the typical learning curve. Can you give us an additional color around the economics of that play right now and potentially thoughts about increasing acreage position there?", "Jeff Ventura", "Yes. We talked a little bit about Nora itself. The results in Nora have been great. When we embarked on our strategy in the Huron Shale a year and a half ago, we just wanted to equally space wells across our roughly 300,000 acre position to understand the shale and its potential. And the good news, it looks like there is great potential really across the entire acreage position. The wells tend to \u2013 costs were coming down today. You are probably at $1.2 million per horizontal well, and I think that number will continue to come down. And reserves are roughly a Bcf for Huron Shale well. So that\u2019s going great.", "And then the other interesting thing, when you look at the other horizons, we\u2019ve started to apply horizontal technology to the Big Lime and to the Berea and other horizons, and the economics look there is strong. We have a great acreage position. We are less than what we own the minerals there. So there is absolutely no pressure to drill. We will do it as it makes sense. And also there is really no need to expand. We think we\u2019ve got tons of upside where we aren\u2019t, but as usual, we will continue to look around and be opportunistic, but we will be very disciplined as well in terms of what we will do.", "David Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company", "Great. Thank you guys very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice. Please proceed with your question. Your mike is now live.", "Ron Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice", "Hey, guys. Jeff, you just mentioned a couple \u2013 answered a couple questions on the Lycoming wells in terms of lateral length and stages. Can you comment a little bit on the cost of those wells relative to Southwest PA and how that relates to guys like Cabot and Chesapeake have talked about as they move more to Susquehanna County, but talking more about 5-plus Bcf type wells?", "Jeff Ventura", "Yes. When you look at Lycoming County well we are drilling, and you\u2019ve got to be careful when you are in the Northeast because you can find the Marcellus at a variety of depths, and if you go far enough east, it actually outcrops and is at the surface. Where we are in Lycoming County, it\u2019s at about 8,500 feet deep. So the wells are going to cost a little more, roughly about $1 million more than our wells in the Southwest. In the development mode today, when we had drilling, our wells in the Southwest to drill and complete are about $3.5 million.", "In a development mode in the Northeast, in Lycoming County where the wells are about 8,500 feet deep, I think you\u2019re looking at $4.5 million. But couldn\u2019t be happier, our first two tries out of the box, 13.5 million per day, and those are seven-day averages. And we\u2019ll continue to test wells, and they look \u2013 they are going to be great wells. I can tell you that. So I think the reserves are going to be very strong. It\u2019s a little early to pin down a number, but they are strong and they are going to be great.", "Ron Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice", "Okay. And then from \u2013 you obviously didn\u2019t want to put out the 24-hour rates, but obviously much higher than that. Is there something going on in that \u2013 this is also one of those wells, I think located adjacent to where you drilled the vertical well, tested at 6.5 million a day. I\u2019m trying to get a sense, as you move across your acreage position there, some of the attributes of the rocks that may cause those production rigs to differ, if any.", "Jeff Ventura", "Yes. One advantage that you have there, you\u2019re deeper, you\u2019re 8,500 feet and you have high pressure gradient. So you\u2019ve got a lot of reservoir pressure, which is positive. You\u2019ve got a lot of gas in place, and obviously you have some quality rock with this if you\u2019re getting rates like that. The 24-hour rates were fantastic. We\u2019re just putting out, we think, longer-term rates are still fantastic and they are probably more indicative of longer-term performance. But they are super wells. So I\u2019m really excited about our position there.", "John Pinkerton", "Yes. And this is John. It\u2019s important to note that the vertical well rate is plus 6 million a day. That was a 24-hour IP versus these are seven-day rates. And obviously our view is 24-hour rates (inaudible). That\u2019s why hopefully as we go along here, we will give you more of these, like, seven-day rates and even longer rates, because I think those are much more indicative in terms of the quality of the wells versus given 24-hour IP. In some cases, that\u2019s all you have. But in this case, we\u2019ve tested these wells now and we had the seven-day number. So we decided those were more appropriate, more indicative of what we thought the well quality was versus giving you a 24-hour rate, which as you mentioned as probably a bit higher.", "Jeff Ventura", "And the other thing I\u2019ll say is, like I said, we\u2019ve actually given you guys the rates for all of our horizontal wells in the form of zero time plots, which I think are much better than type curve. That\u2019s the actual real data by program year just put back the time zero. And the curve that we\u2019ve put out is \u2013 and you can see the curves going up and down when you look at it by year. That\u2019s just the actual real data. And then the sum of that data, we did smooth it, but it\u2019s still a zero time plot, which I think is higher quality than a type curve.", "Ron Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice", "Okay. And then lastly, maybe this is for Rodney or Roger. With the sale of Ohio properties at the end of March, John, I guess you provided the first quarter production guidance, but with the impact of that sales, something where the second quarter will tend on an absolute basis to look more flat with the first quarter because of the timing of that sale and then their allocation or re-allocation of those sales proceeds would then drive more second half growth. Is that the right way to look at that 12% target?", "John Pinkerton", "Yes, that\u2019s exactly the way to \u2013 and most likely, we will break our 29 consecutive quarter sequential production growth because we\u2019re probably going to sell \u2013 close on the Ohio, say, right at the end of the first quarter. So we\u2019ll have 25 million a day or so. It\u2019s going to go flying off the production books. The good news is, as Jeff mentioned, we do have a number of plays that are in the process of being completed. And then we hook up whether we can overcome all 25 million of that in day one of the first quarter, first part of the second quarter. It\u2019s going to be a real, real challenge for our operating team.", "I wouldn\u2019t bet against on it, but my gut feel is that we will see production either be flat or down a little bit in the second quarter, and then as we get the wells hooked and as these pipelines and whatnot, then you will see production really ramp up in the second half of the year on a relative basis for the first half. So again that\u2019s \u2013 I think that makes absolute sense, and again it was part of the whole process we went through this year in terms of \u2013 if you think about what we\u2019ve done last year, we sold Fuhrman right at about the middle of the year. This year we felt it is really important to really tee up the Ohio.", "Really we teed it up at the end of \u2013 in the fourth quarter of 2009, really opened it up to data rooms in December. Chad and his team did a terrific job of getting all that organized and getting the data room open. And we had a lot of interest in those properties and we were able to come what we believe is a very good agreement with our friends at EnerVest in terms of VAT. And I think it\u2019s a good deal for both sides. I think again it\u2019s a really high quality property that had some upsides from some formations that they are focused on. Obviously we\u2019re much more focused on the Marcellus over in PA. So it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s a win-win deal for each side. I think getting it done soon early in the year and getting it done in the first quarter is really important I think for us to be able to kind of charge-off on our capital program.", "Ron Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice", "And then the $950 million capital program, given your hedge position and the sales proceeds, is that based on a particular NYMEX price, somewhere in the low-to-mid sized, who were you continue to fund yourselves out of cash flow in the sales proceeds or how was that \u2013?", "John Pinkerton", "Ron, given that we\u2019ve got 75% of our gas production hedged at 5.50 floor, I mean, gas price could go to $4 and we\u2019re still in good shape.", "Ron Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Carver with Capital One Southcoast. Please proceed with your question. Your mike is now live.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "Yes. Of the 150 wells that you\u2019re drilling and casing this year, how many do you plan on putting on line?", "Jeff Ventura", "About 90 of them.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "Okay. And based on your commentary, I assume that\u2019s more way towards the back half of the year.", "Jeff Ventura", "Yes, we\u2019ll put them on as soon as we can, but the growth will be just like John described.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "Okay, great. Cabot announced an impressive well in the Purcell Limestone earlier this week. Do you\u00a0have a feel for how much of that could be on your acreage and do you plan on doing any test there?", "Jeff Ventura", "We have a lot of upside that\u2019s very similar to that, but it isn\u2019t the Purcell. It\u2019s very analogous to the Purcell, and that the Purcell is a limy interval in the middle of the Marcellus. What we have in the Southwest, in particular, is we have the Tully, which is in between our Marcellus and the Upper Devonian shales that we have there. So we have a lot of gas in place to find because we\u2019ve drilled through continually. We\u2019re now just starting to test it. So we have a huge upside in terms of the Upper Devonian, and of course we are testing the Utica of the lowest.", "I think more importantly, when you stand back and look at all that, what you\u2019re really getting at is, I should say in my opinion, which is really important is, looking at gas in place throughout the trend and throughout the plays in the various horizons. You have to quantify where is that gas and plays located and looking what can the recovery be. We\u2019ve told you that and particularly in the Marcellus acreage, we\u2019ve got 18 to 25 Tcf of upside just from the Marcellus. I can tell you the upside from this Upper Devonian Shale and from the Utica is tremendous. And it\u2019s literally on par with that. We haven\u2019t put a number out yet. We\u2019ve quantified it, we\u2019ve been studying it for a long time, and we\u2019re now testing it. But we\u2019ve got tremendous upside in other horizons, and some of it is very analogous to what they have.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And one last question, on the longer laterals, what\u2019s the additional cost on those compared to the laterals \u2013 the average laterals that you\u2019ve been drilling?", "Jeff Ventura", "The cost to drill the lateral is really inexpensive because the shale drill is really flat. It really comes down to how many additional pages are you pumping. So if you\u2019re going to from eight stages to 16 stages or from eight to 12 or whatever that optimum ends up being.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "But what was the total \u2013?", "Jeff Ventura", "Just to put color on it, it may take a while that the development well in the Southwest from 3.5 million maybe to 4.0 million or 4.1 million. But again I think that if it\u2019s worse, you\u2019re going to be looking at better rates of return and actually lower finding cost.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "Great. Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Tudor Pickering Holt. Please proceed with your question. Your mike is now live.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "As you think about services cost and one of the things that we\u2019ve heard on the live calls is increasing pressure pumping costs and kind of adding seven stages will affect your estimate kind of $85,000 a stage. Is it reasonable to think that those could escalate to 15% or 20% this year on a per-stage basis?", "Jeff Ventura", "That to me, it sounds a little high. I think you will see upward pressure. To me, it sounds a little high though based on what you\u2019re saying.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "Where would you expect the average stage cost to go?", "Jeff Ventura", "Maybe goes up 10% to 15% rather than 15% to 20%. And then now I think you\u2019re going to have other things or it will be \u2013 a lot of our rigs are locked in and obviously those costs are flat fuel cost relative to last year, at least for the first half of the year probably will be relatively flat. So there is a variety of pieces in that total cost.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "I\u2019ll get right into the next question. As you think about rig contracts that you contracted as you\u2019re growing into an increasing schedule, your ability to contract now is yet to be potentially at a little lower day rate. Is that sort of you see an offset to any increasing pressure pumping cost and a lower drilling cost?", "Jeff Ventura", "Yes.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "Okay. That was \u2013 you walked right into that.", "Jeff Ventura", "That\u2019s (inaudible). Even with the rigs we have, the costs are \u2013 I'm thrilled that we are at $3.5 million. Those new rigs, the efficiencies are so much greater that it\u2019s a slight thing to do for us, and it will average out with time, it will help offset some of the costs like you\u2019re saying.", "John Pinkerton", "Yes. David, as you know, I think one of the important things about the Marcellus, at least in the Southwest, is that when the rig rate (inaudible) in the Barnett, a lot of that equipment end up going to the Marcellus because it fit the Marcellus in terms of pressure pumping ability and size of rigs and whatnot. It wasn\u2019t really able to migrate to the Haynesville because the Haynesville is obviously much deeper, a lot more pressure in terms of pressure pumping. So the good news is, in terms of I think in the piece of Barnett, there were 215 well rigs being in operation.", "Today it\u2019s probably way less than half of that. So there is still a lot of equipment, and I just think that the pressure in terms of that is going to be less than, let\u2019s say, some of the other shale plays. That being said, at least in our view, there is probably a pretty good chance that the Marcellus by the end of this year will be the most active gas play in the world. So there is going to be pressure. The good news is, we\u2019ve got great relationships with the vendors. We\u2019ve been up there for a long time. We\u2019ve got a lot of long-term contracts and relationships. And I think it would be crazy for most vendors know that we own 900,000 net acres in the fairway.", "We own another several hundred thousand outside of the fairway that has the chance of being good. So I think our ability to attract high quality services \u2013 and it\u2019s not just the equipment, the quality of people that work on that equipment as well. And the good news is that\u2019s changing because a lot of people have moved up to Appalachia and being trained and whatnot. So we\u2019re seeing a lot of progress in that area, and we\u2019re very pleased. And again, it also has to do with the quality of our team.", "We now have roughly 175 people in Pittsburgh. Two years ago, we had one. So we\u2019ve really ramped up the team. We\u2019ve got really high quality people. They have a lot of experience. And that\u2019s what gives us the confidence that we can go from roughly 40 wells drilled and completed in 2009 to over about 150 for 2010. That\u2019s a huge ramp-up in terms of activity. And again, you will see some of that in the back half of 2010, and you\u2019re really going to see the ramp-up in the Boomerang in 2011.", "That\u2019s why we gave you that number, the corporate-wide number for 2011. So \u2013 and then it will continue to increase from that in terms of rate. So once we get through that and then obviously the key to life for all the shareholders, again, given that I\u2019m the largest individual shareholder that we kick over in late 2012 in terms of being positive cash flow. And then at that point in time, it\u2019s going to be (inaudible) in terms of what we\u2019re going to be able to do. So pretty exciting \u2013 pretty exciting time in terms of all that.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "Couple follow-ups to what you just said, John. As you look at the cash flow in that $1 billion and being part of the asset sales, what price deck are you using for that?", "John Pinkerton", "I use the strip, the gas strip on February \u2013 I think February 20th or something is what we used. I don\u2019t have it right in front of me, but \u2013", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "That\u2019s fine, thanks. And then thinking about segregating activity levels as you ramped from 40 to 150 to 250 to 300 wells in 2011, how much will you do in the Southwest dry gas and then the wet gas, and then how much will you do in the Northeast region as you balance your program across the state?", "John Pinkerton", "We really haven\u2019t \u2013 I mean, we have some ideas on that. I think Jeff gave you some pretty good numbers for 2010. I think it\u2019s a little early to figure all that out obviously.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "You\u2019re obviously planning it just \u2013", "John Pinkerton", "Yes, we are planning it. I think \u2013 I think at this point in time, we\u2019re just not \u2013 we haven\u2019t \u2013 we really haven\u2019t got enough numbers on the paper. I feel comfortable to give those out in the public.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "And then as you look at 900,000 acres and over 1 million acres, how does getting acreage or additional property acquisitions into that big inventory work? I mean, how do you think about that kind of big picture-wise as opportunities come up?", "John Pinkerton", "It\u2019s obviously interesting, and it\u2019s something that we spend a lot of time on. And let me just give you \u2013 it's really \u2013 David, that\u2019s really a great, great question. Let me take just a little bit of time because I think it\u2019s really important. If you think about it, we spent, I don\u2019t know, $100 million this year on acreage. But our net acreage count in the fairway actually stayed even at about 900,000 acres. So yes, the question is, what did you do with that money? And what we did with that money is really block up our existing key areas.", "We really think blocking up the acreage is the key to success in terms of being able to ramp up production at low cost, because if you think about it, if you block up your acreage and you can drill multiple wells from a well site. You\u2019ve got one location, you\u2019ve got one road, you\u2019ve got one pipeline. You don\u2019t have to \u2013 you don\u2019t have pipelines all over the place and roads all over the place. It\u2019s just much more efficient. It\u2019s also much more environmentally friendly, and we\u2019re being very sensitive to the citizens and the commonwealth in terms of doing that because we don\u2019t want to tear up the surface.", "So it\u2019s a challenge. I think the good news is, is that we\u2019ve been blocking up literally for about 2.5 years now. We haven\u2019t bought any, what I\u2019d call, trend acreage for over two, 2.5 years. In fact, we sold off what we considered to be some C-quality acreage in 2009. And we\u2019re going to continue to do that, as time goes on. But I think you will see us do a number of things this year. We will continue to block up in and around our core areas. We will continue to do acreage trades. We\u2019re trading acreage with other operators to block up.", "And you\u2019re also going to see us in some areas where we have, let\u2019s say, scattered acreage or acreage that has \u2013 doesn't have as much term on as some others. You will see us actually contribute to those other operators and let them grow wells on our acreage where, let\u2019s say, they have 60% and we have 40%. But it\u2019s really high quality operator. We don\u2019t have to operate everything, and we can leverage off of what they are doing. So I mean, we\u2019re thinking through all of that stuff. All that being said, the one thing again in terms of doing a JV or selling off a big chunk of the acreage, we think the acreage is worth a hell of a lot more than the $14,000 that Mitsui paid.", "And again, that is our opinion. We\u2019ve run a lot of numbers. I mentioned when Chesapeake did the deal with the Norwegians, I thought the Norwegians got a pretty good deal. And I think the 14 \u2013 going 15,600 to 14,000. I think you will see that number continue to escalate up as more and more data gets out, more and more wells get out, and people get more and more uncomfortable with the economics of the Marcellus. So again, it\u2019s a challenge, but I think we\u2019ve got a good handle on it and we\u2019ve got a lot of HBP acreage and obviously we\u2019re HBP-ing a lot of acreages by our drilling plant as well.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Scialla with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed with your question. Your mike is now live.", "Mike Scialla \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Hi, guys. I guess, John, if somebody offers you $14,000 an acre tomorrow, you\u2019re not a seller?", "John Pinkerton", "No.", "Mike Scialla \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. In terms of some of the older wells in the Marcellus, do you see any changes in the liquid yields there? There has been some talk here recently about some of these (inaudible) areas, potentially rich for condensate type reservoirs. Have you seen any evidence of that with your area in the Marcellus?", "John Pinkerton", "No.", "Mike Scialla \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Good quick answers.", "John Pinkerton", "We are not seeing any changes \u2013", "Mike Scialla \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "In terms of the long-term plans for produced water, can you talk about those at all?", "John Pinkerton", "Yes. I\u2019ve been really proud of our team up there. Not only we discovered the play in five years, in terms of the drilling and completion, but in terms of what to do with the water, really starting in about spring of last year, we started recycling water, and by August/September in the Southwest, where we\u2019ve had drilling, we\u2019re recycling 100% of our water. And that\u2019s going really well. I told you the number other day. We\u2019ve recycled over 70 million gallons of water, and the team has done a great job there. And so far, that looks great.", "And the other thing we are doing is we are working with the authorities in terms of testing some disposals on and then setting up some water disposal wells. And the state liked \u2013 the DEP liked that solution, the EPA liked that solution, and we will be doing that this year as well. I think by the end of the year, and so far they are encouraging as well. By the end of the year, I\u2019m hoping to couple recycling with the social wells, and if that works, those two things in common, I think that basically will take care of the water disposal problem. So basically in the pad [ph] drilling right now with recycling, we\u2019re at zero discharge. It also reduces the need on the front end because you\u2019re recycling on the water. And then to the extent you have step-out wells or extraneous wells, hopefully we will just go to our own disposal wells.", "Mike Scialla \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And Jeff, you said you are encouraged by the year-to-go. What you have seen there? Did you take course with schedule approach?", "Jeff Ventura", "What\u2019s encouraging, I think, is a combination of two things. The answer is, no, we did not core. But clearly we ran extensive logs across including the (inaudible) logs where you\u2019re coming with an estimate of how many Bcf per mount [ph] you\u00a0have in place, and those numbers look very strong. Obviously you need to test to confirm it. As you\u2019re drilling through it, you get gas shelves [ph]. There is different data that you gather. And so far, all of that looks encouraging. Obviously until you tested that the proof in the pudding. But so far it looks great, and we\u2019re excited for the past.", "Mike Scialla \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And just one last one from me. John talked about blocking up your acreage, where does the state stand in terms of getting unit position or sometimes (inaudible)?", "John Pinkerton", "Yes, great question. We are \u2013 one of the real positives I think in the Marcellus is that there is a group of the industry, the E&P industry has formed a group called the Marcellus Shale coalition. And we hired a president of that, and this is real live organism that\u2019s really doing good work, not only in terms of best practices across the play, which are in most cases much better and much higher stringent in terms of what the DEP is requesting, which I think I see that as a real positive. But some of the other things we\u2019re doing is, as coalition come together to try to look at the current regulatory environment in some of the rules and regulations.", "We\u2019ve worked by to come up with proposals to the stake in terms of modernizing some of the rule sin there. And we\u2019ve had very good dial log [ph], not only among the companies, but also among the regulators and the legislator that obviously to some degree ha a hand in that. So I see that all progressed very, very well, and I think you will see the fruits of all that hard work over the last year or so \u2013 we are at two years, come out later this year, with some hopefully some modernization signs that aren\u2019t critical but that is important as the play ramps up in terms of just making everybody\u2019s life easy, we\u2019re also making it easier for the state, for the royalty owner, and for the companies that we maximize the place for all the different constituencies, which is really, really important. I think as we look out over the next five to 10 years in this play.", "Mike Scialla \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Your mike is now live.", "Dan McSpirit \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Gentlemen, good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. Turning to the Northeast part of the Marcellus, 15 to 20 wells that you will drill there this year, what are the distances between wells and how much acreage do you think you will de-risk by drilling these wells?", "Jeff Ventura", "The distances between the wells will vary. Some of them are stepping out quite away, probably on the order of \u2013 when I said the 9 miles between the two wells, it\u2019s actually 8.9 miles. To answer your question, I haven\u2019t physically majored the ones that you\u2019re probably looking at wells that are as far part as 20 or 30 miles. So they are pretty good plays. Other wells would be close and drilled to where the pipeline connections are. So the combination of wells and rates are stepping out. I think by the end of this year, through our drilling and through the industry drilling that a very significant portion of that acreage is going to be de-risk.", "John Pinkerton", "Let me just \u2013 this is John. Let me just take on what just Jeff said. One of the things, they give a little bit of what our plan was. Obviously we\u2019re not a giant company with a giant budget. So we had to be very frugal in terms of how we ramped up and how we did that. That\u2019s one of the reasons we picked this up. We\u2019ll have to start. There is a whole bunch of technical reasons, but one of the business reasons was, we had pipelines in place. We already had field operations in Marcellus drilling. So there were a lot of reasons to start that. And now that\u2019s up and gone, and we feel like we de-risk a whole boat load of acreage and we\u2019re really excited about, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive our production this year and have a big impact on the next several years.", "The second stage of the next leg of stool is the Northeast. And one of the things that we\u2019re really hoping that would happen that\u2019s happened is that other companies would help de-risk our acreage. And that\u2019s happening in a huge way. And we get calls all the time from companies and we share data and we share logs and test data and whatnot, and big companies, small companies, private companies, public companies. So the good news is a lot of wells have been drilled in the Northeast that\u2019s really de-risking our acreage, without our capital dollars. And that was something that we hoped to happen and now it\u2019s really happened, because the Northeast is really, really competitive. It\u2019s really ramping up in terms of the number of rigs up there. And that really helps us. We\u2019re all in favor of that. We\u2019re a cheerleader on that side as we do that.", "And then again, we will have a better idea how to develop our acreage from that. And then also the infrastructure will be easy. Now, the Southwest, we\u2019re basically towing the road to us with our joint venture with MarkWest. Up in the Northeast, I think we will be more infrastructure joint ventures and thing with the other independents, so we\u2019ll be able to share the cost and that freight going forward just because the acreage is \u2013 that\u2019s the way the acreage is done. So again, both of time \u2013 so I think \u2013 stepping back, our grand vision is actually bearing the fruit pretty much like we thought and hoped it would. So all in all, we\u2019ll \u2013 again, we\u2019re pretty hectic.", "Dan McSpirit \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, okay. And then turning to Texas Panhandle, the wells that you plan for 2010, can you talk about the objective there that you are drilling and the target of the economics?", "Jeff Ventura", "Yes. In the Texas Panhandle, specifically, we are targeting primarily the St. Louis formation. Our guys up there \u2013 we've got a pretty good acreage position already built, but we\u2019re still leasing. So I don\u2019t give a lot of details. But I will tell you the economics on it look really strong. You\u2019re looking at cost to find and develop well below $1 and rates of return that are competitive with the Marcellus. So it\u2019s \u2013 they have got a great play. Again, it\u2019s something our team discovered and is leading the industry. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in the Panhandle.", "Dan McSpirit \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then one more if I can. On both the Upper Devonian and the Utica tests, can you share any thoughts on maybe timing of results, expectations on economics and including costs?", "Jeff Ventura", "It\u2019s probably for us going to be similar to what the Marcellus was a couple of years ago. Hopefully, and you\u2019ve been looking and following us for a long time, and we continue to peel back the layers of the onion in the Marcellus and give more and more information. And in time we\u2019ll be totally transparent with all of it. They are really spotting up our acreage and showing you the wells and help de-risking the whole thing. However, with the Upper Devonian and the Utica, sort of back where we were a few years back with the Marcellus. We think there is big upside and we want to make sure we capture that value for our shareholders. There is tremendous amounts of gas in place, and potentially large amounts in recoverable gas there. So we\u2019ll be coy there, but in time again we will be putting up results.", "Dan McSpirit \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Very good. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you again.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Dan.", "Operator", "Thank you. We are nearing the end of today\u2019s conference. We will go to Leo Mariani of RBC Capital Markets for our final question.", "Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Hi, good afternoon here, guys.", "John Pinkerton", "Hi, Leo.", "Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "You guys talked about your retail being about 13 rigs right now in the Marcellus, going to 24 in 2011. Want to get a breakdown of how many of those are going to be spudded rigs versus horizontal rigs.", "Jeff Ventura", "Currently it\u2019s about 50/50. I think that mix with time will just vary depending on how efficient the various rigs become. But right now, it\u2019s about 50/50.", "Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Hi. You guys plan on continuing to employ spudded rigs going forward, it sounds like.", "Jeff Ventura", "Yes. Where we are today, it looks like they drilled the vertical part in a more cost effective way and then we move off the air rig and come back, mud up, and bring in the bigger rigs. Today that gives us the best economic. And again, we can always try to improve with time, and we\u2019ll see where that leads us.", "Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. I think you guys have made a comment on the call that a portion of your acreage a decent chunk in the Marcellus (inaudible) 900,000 is APP. Just curious if you guys could quantify a little.", "John Pinkerton", "It\u2019s less than half, but it\u2019s a big chunk", "Jeff Ventura", "Yes. With the drilling plans in place, we will be holding the acreage with time, and our team is very aware with that. And the drilling schedule that we put out accomplishes that for us.", "Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And your position in Northeast Pennsylvania, I think about 350,000 acres, you drilled your first couple in Lycoming. What other counties in Northeast PA do you guys have significant acreages?", "Jeff Ventura", "We haven\u2019t put out the specific counties, and again that\u2019s jut for competitive reasons. We\u2019re becoming more transparent. We told you where those really good vertical wells are and that\u2019s where we drill our horizontals. But I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s a slot from Bradford, from Lycoming and a little bit through there. It\u2019s right in the guts of where Mitsui just paid Anadarko $14,000 an acre for.", "Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. You talked about 4.4 Bs in Southwest PA I guess on the wells you drilled to date at this point in time being for your actual EUR. What\u2019s your average lateral length over those particular wells?", "Jeff Ventura", "It\u2019s probably going to be about 2,400, 2,500 feet. The low end is 2,200 feet. The high end is 2,800 feet. The low frac stages are three, although it was really in the first year. And there is \u2013 actually it\u2019s on our website for the other years at seven or eight stages. And again, I think that\u2019s fantastic results when you look at the economic that that generates, but I\u2019m really excited about the experiment that we have in place. And that we will talk about over time. We just want to gather more production history, and what you will see us do is continue to update those plots and curves. And again, we\u2019ve given you every single horizontal well we drilled in the form of a zero time plot, which is the just the actual data by program year. And we will continue to update that. Probably what we will do is break apart the shorter laterals that we drilled through August of last year and then this whole series of longer laterals and more stages. So we can quantify the difference.", "Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "All right. And I guess in your 2010 drilling program, is it going to be a majority of the wells that are going to have longer laterals at this point in time or is it more of a small fraction?", "Jeff Ventura", "Where we are today, the wells will be typically longer laterals than that and with more stages. What we don\u2019t know at this point in time is where that optimum is, but we\u2019ve got a lot of things in place and we will be defining that as we go forward. And of course, we will continually look and see we can improve there as we gather data. But we are setting them up for typically more than eight stages and more than 2,800-foot laterals.", "Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "All right. Thanks a lot, guys.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Leo.", "Jeff Ventura", "Thanks, Leo.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Pinkerton for his concluding remarks.", "John Pinkerton", "Well, we\u2019ve run quite a bit over. We really appreciate all of you who joined us today. Obviously we\u2019re really excited about what we\u2019ve got in the potential at Range. And we will continue to work hard and hopefully perform. And why don\u2019t we just terminate the call?

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome. Range Resources reported results for the first quarter 2010 with record production, leading the consensus numbers and continued to execute our business plan with improvement in unit cost while navigation this period of challenging commodity prices.", "The first quarter marked our 29th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. Although we are encouraged with our resource base to continue to grow production and reserves in the future, we are more focused on achieving those targets at an optimum cost structure on a per share basis to maximize shareholder value. I think you will hear those same things reiterated from each of the speakers today.", "On the call with me today are John Pinkerton, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Ventura, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Roger Manny, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Before turning the call over to John, I'd like to cover a few administrative items. First, we did file our 10-Q with the SEC this morning. It's now available on the home page of our website, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDA and cash margins, and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today. Tables are also posted on the website that will give you the detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter.", "Secondly, we will be participating in several conferences in May. Check our website for a complete listing for the next several months. Moving at (inaudible) it's going be held at May 13 to 14, on last 13 (inaudible) conference in Houston on May 21st, and the UBS Oil & Gas Conference on May 27 stockholders meeting will be held on May the 19th, with the help of each of the stockholder as received their proxy material and we urge each stockholder for the proposal being submitted in the proxy.", "Now let me turn it over the call to John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Rodney. Before Roger reviews the first quarter financial results, I will review some of the key accomplishments so far in 2010. First, on a year-over-year basis, first quarter production rose 12%, reaching the high end of guidance.", "This also marks the 29th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. If you adjust for asset sales first quarter 2010 production would have been 18%. Second, our joint program is on schedule throughout the quarter as we drilled 72 wells. We continue to be very pleased with our drilling results and despite the lower prices. We are generating attractive returns on the capital.", "Currently, we have 22 rigs in operation. A 12% increase in production was more than offset by 16% decrease in realized prices. As a result, first quarter oil and gas revenues were down 6%, compared to the prior year. We are most pleased on the cost side as on our per unit production basis nearly all cost categories were lower than the prior period.", "In particular, direct operating cost came in $0.73 per Mcfe. This is 22% lower than the prior year period, quite an achievement. With regards to our Marcellus Shale play, significant headwind was made in the quarter as we continue to drill some fantastic wells filling our acreage position to test the other Shale formations and continue to build out infrastructure.", "In addition, we continue to add high quality technical personnel to our Marcellus team in Pittsburgh, which now includes over 200 people. Right at the end of the quarter, we completed the initial phase of our Ohio asset sale which generated roughly $300 million of proceeds. This sale included 3300 wells in over 13,000 leases.", "I'm really pleased that we were able to get it close so early in the year. All now I couldn't be more pleased on how much we accomplished in the first quarter. I think it's a real testimony to all of us here at Range especially the technical folks. With that I will turn the call over to Roger to view financial results.", "Roger Manny", "Thank you, John. The first quarter of 2010 in some way was a lot like the first quarter of 2009. Production reached to record quarterly high 12% higher than the prior year and Range posted another solidly profitable first quarter despite oil and gas prices in the first quarter like last year been sharply low.", "Turning to a bit deeper into the numbers however, revealed a stronger operating performance in the last year, to significantly lower unit operating cost plus the balance sheet benefits having sold most of our Ohio tight gas sand properties at the end of March.", "Quarterly oil and gas sales including past settled derivatives totaled $233 million down 6% from the last year's revenue figure of 248. Once again unfortunately, the decline in prices just offset the benefit of higher production volumes. Cash flow for the first quarter of 2010 was $147 million, 7% below the first quarter of '09 with cash flow per share $0.92, $0.02 above the analyst consensus estimate of $0.90.", "EBITDAX for the quarter was $176 million, 5% lower than the first quarter of '09. First quarter of 2010 cash margins were down 18% from last year at $3.49 per Mcfe compared to $4.25 per Mcfe in 2009. There were a few extraordinary revenue and expense items going through the financial statements this quarter starting with the pretax unrealized marketing and market gain on our hedges of $46 million, and a $69 million pretax book gain primarily from the sale of our Ohio properties.", "On the expense side, we have $7.9 million in severance cost from Ohio sale along with the $6.5 million low gas price in dues impairment of the Gulf Coast property. Lastly, as our stock price declined slightly during the quarter, we reported non-cash income of $5.7 million related to our deferred compensation plan, and quarterly GAAP net income was $78 million.", "Quarterly earnings calculated using analyst methodology for the first quarter, which excludes non-recurring items such as asset sales, unrealized derivative mark-to-market entries, that was $26 million or $0.16 per fully diluted share and that's $0.02 higher than the analyst consensus estimate of $0.14.", "As Rodney mentioned the Range Resources website contains a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures I just mentioned including cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and analyst earnings. These non-recurring items should not math some of the recurring good news found deeper in the expense line to the income statement. And first up on the good news was as John mentioned is the cash direct operating expense reduction per Mcfe of $0.023 in the first quarter, compared to $0.93 last year.", "This represents a 22% decrease. Direct operating cost is now running 30% below, its peak of a $1.05 per Mcfe in mid-20008.", "The news gets even better when looking ahead into the second quarter this year when we expect to see the full benefit of selling the higher cost Ohio properties take hold. The sale should further reduce direct operating cost per Mcfe by another nickel. That would bring it down to the high $0.60 range.", "Production factors have drifted lower with the decline in property taxes and production increases in low tax jurisdictions resulting in production taxes down to $0.19 per Mcfe in the quarter, compared to $0.22 last year. G&A expense adjusted for non-cash stock comp was $0.49 per Mcfe for the first quarter of 2010, that's down $0.01 from the first quarter of last year.", "G&A expenses per Mcfe will likely stay flat around the $0.50 mark as G&A dollars were shifted from areas where we have sold assets to areas such as the Marcellus, where we continue to create jobs and add numerous professionals and technical support members to the team.", "Interest expense for the first quarter of 2010 was $0.72 per Mcfe that's $0.01 higher than the first quarter of last year, and that reflects the shift from short-term floating rate debt, long-term fixed rate debts that we made during the second quarter of last year. Interest expense should remain flat for the next few quarters with most all of our debt appearing fixed interest rate, and the cash on hand from the Ohio sales available for summer capital program.", "Exploration expense for the first quarter of 2010 excluding non-cash stock comp was $13.5 million. That's $1.2 million higher than the first quarter of last year due to primarily the higher delayed rentals. We anticipate that quarterly exploration expense excluding non-cash comp will approximate $15 million to $18 million in the second quarter due to seasonal size and making delayed rental increases before falling back to the $10 million to $12 million for quarter range for the rest of the year.", "Depletion, depreciation, and amortization for Mcfe for the first quarter were $2.12 and that's compared to $2.25 in the first quarter of last year. The figure consists of a $1.97 per Mcfe in depletion expense and $0.15 attributable to depreciation and amortization of all other assets.", "Our DD&A rate has declined considerably from the $2.34 Mcfe rate for all of '09. The lower depletion is primarily from the continued favorable performance from our Marcellus wells and well the DD&A rate will fluctuate quarterly going forward with our production mix.", "We anticipated DD&A rate in the 215 to 220 per Mcfe range for the rest of the year. Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties came in at $12.4 million in the first quarter plus down $7.2 million from the last year. Investors may expect to see in abandonment and impairment figure for unproved in the second quarter of approximately $12 million to $14 million.", "Range incurred $49 million in the deferred taxes for the quarter but paid no cash taxes. Following the following of our year-end federal income tax return, our NOL carry forward is now $322 million. Our effective rate for the rest of the year is anticipated, it could be 38.5% with all cash federal tax payments deferred.", "Cash state taxes were approximately a $1 million for the quarter. Now while we are on the subject to taxes, you may have noticed that we have elected to play the bulk of the Ohio asset sale proceeds in the like-kind exchange account, but the interest rate on our bank facility hovering around 2%. We felt that the negative carry incurred represent a small price to pay to the ability to possibly differ some or all of the estimated $255 million gain on Ohio transaction and the cash is completely unrestricted and we may move the funds out of the account any time we desire.", "The remainder of 2010, Range has approximately 77% of its gas production hedge with collars at a floor price of $5.53 per Mmbtu and a cap of $7.21 per Mmbtu. We now have approximately 51% of our anticipated 2011 gas production hedge with collars at a floor price of $5.73 per Mmbtu and a ceiling of $6.83 per Mmbtu.", "On the oil side, we have 1,000 barrels per day in 2010 hedge using collars at $75 by $93.75 and approximately 5200 barrels per day hedge in 2011 with the collar of $70 by $90. The size of the previously mentioned asset sale proceeds parked in cash on the balance sheet. There were several other balance sheet items worthy of mention.", "First, despite significant asset sales on March 30, the Range Bank Group reaffirmed the existing $1.5 billion borrowing base to an extermination date of October 2010. We elect to retain the existing $1.25 billion commitment under the borrowing base and no changes to the loan structure or interest rates; structure was required with the reaffirmation. And second, unlike last year when we were outspending cash flow during the first quarter anticipating asset sales would occur later in the year.", "This year we have completed our asset sales by the end of the first quarter effectively removing any financing to transaction service from our 2010 capital plan. The benefits of discipline spending and a completed asset sale may also be seen in our debt to cap ratio letting the cash balance against our bank debt produces a net debt to cap ratio at the end of the quarter at 36%. This places our leverage below our targeted 40% ratio, and it compares favorably to the 43% ratio at the end of '09s first quarter and the 47% ratio in 2008.", "Our leverage ratio below target gives us additional flexibility as we move through the year. In summary, the first quarter of 2010 was a stronger quarter operationally with continued double digit production growth accompanied by double digit unit operating cost decline. The first quarter was also a strong quarter strategically with the Ohio asset sale completed over a $1 billion in liquidity in our hedging programs delivering cash flow certainty during periods of low prices.", "Overall we are entering 2010 on a much firmer footing than 2009. Last year, when we started the year, we were sharing rigs and reducing activity to fit the 2009 budget while just commencing the sale of our affirming assets, while this year our significant asset sale is already done, and we have the flexibility of entering the second quarter having under spent our 2010 capital budget on a pro rata basis.", "John, I will turn it back to you.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Roger. Terrific update; I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Ventura who will review our operating activity. Jeff?", "Jeff Ventura", "Thanks, John. I will start the operations update with the Marcellus Shale. Our strategy at Range is and has been growth of low cost. Range's Marcellus production has the best economics of any large scale, repeatable gas play in the U.S. There are basically four reasons for these. The first is this discovery in the Appalachian Basin, which is in close proximity to the best gas markets in the U.S.", "Therefore, the gas produced here is advantaged versus other gas in the U.S. It doesn't have to be transported forward to get to the end users. Second, not all layers in the Marcellus or any other gas play for that matter are equal. To have the best economics, you will have to be in the core part of the play where the rock quality is the best.", "Range clearly has a great position in the core as evidenced by the high quality wells that we have drilled in combined with the way which we've been able to grow our net production with relatively few rigs. The third reason is that Range discovered the modern Marcellus Shale play and has a strategic first mover advantage.", "Since we were the first to pursue the play, our acreage acquisition cost is very low, which significantly impacts our economics in a positive way. The fourth reason, our economics is so good perhaps the best in the Marcellus play so that we are in the wet gas portion of the play, which relatively speaking is a small part of the total Marcellus acreage.", "It exists in the Western half of the Southwest portion of the play, primarily in Southwest Pennsylvania and into the West Virginia Panhandle. Given our gas prices and oil prices are if you are processing which Range does through our contract with MarkWest, this is a huge benefit.", "The NYMEX Henry Hub price is $5 and NYMEX WTI is $75 per barrel. The effective price per Mcfe that Range receives is $7.28 per Mcfe. For an equivalent well in the wet gas area versus the dry gas area, this more than doubled the rate of return. As good as these wells are, we constantly strive to make them better.", "As shown on the most recent IR material on our website, we have continued to evaluate longer laterals and more frac stages. We have shown every horizontal well that we've drilled in the form of zero time plot by program year. Importantly we've continued to improve the quality of our wells year after year, although other Shale plays had the same characteristics, we are unique in our play with economic very early on.", "Other plays require a lot of time, long laterals and a lot of frac stages to make them economic. The fact, that the Marcellus business is evidence of the high quality Shale that we have relative to the other Shale plays. Given the excellent performance of our wells in the core areas coupled with improving completions, we have increased the range of recovery estimates for our wells from 3.4 Bcfe up to 4 Bcfe to 5 Bcfe.", "We've also adjusted the expected cost of our development wells in the Southwest Pennsylvania from $3.5 million to $4 million per well. This increase is a direct result of going to longer laterals in more frac stages. The bottom line is a better rate of return, lower finding cost and better efficiency.", "The build out of the infrastructure continues on plan. Oil capacity will be increased to MarkWest from 155 million per day to day to 290 million per day by mid-2011. Dry gas gathering and compression capacity in the Southwest will be increased from 20 million per day to day to 65 million per day by late 2011.", "Dry gas gathering and compression capacity in the Northeast through our PVR contract will come online late this year and will be 120 million per day by late 2011. In aggregate by late 2011, we have the infrastructure capacity of 575 million cubic feet per day. As you can see we are on track to reach our Marcellus production target of exiting this year at a net rate of $180 million to $200 million per day in exiting 2011 at a net rate of 360 million to 400 million per day.", "We have a first class team of more than 200 people located in Southwest Pennsylvania focused on this project. Given our team, our acreage and the infrastructure that we have in place in the works were well positioned to meet or exceed our plans for the Marcellus.", "We've have also drilled, and tested one horizontal Upper Devonian well, and one horizontal Utica well in Pennsylvania. This is the first horizontal Utica well in the entire Appalachian Basin and the first Upper Devonian Shale well on Pennsylvania. Both wells successfully tested gas. However, we plan to keep the results confidential for a while due to competitive reasons.", "We plan to drill one or two more horizontal wells in each of our horizons by year-end. In regard to our 2010 budget, 77% of our capital going on to the Marcellus Shale that's because Marcellus is our highest rate of return project. In addition outside of the Marcellus, almost all of our acreage is held by production, where we own the minerals and hold it in perpetuity. Therefore, we have the flexibility to pull back spending in our non-Marcellus projects.", "We have decreased our 2010 budget for Nora by about 50% versus 2009. In the Barnett, we dropped from 68 rigs about 15 months ago to one rig to two rigs today. The projects in both areas have good rates to return at today's prices. It's importantly we will continue to monitor them and look at the rates to return on a real time basis and adjust accordingly.", "The final area I want to mention is our Mid Continent division. We are planning on spending about 7% or $70 million of our 2010 budget there. We are primarily targeting a new play that we discovered to St. Louis. We believe we can spend about $1.3 million per well to get about 2 Bcfe in reserves. Importantly, it also has an oil component which on top of the strong F&D helps with the economics.", "From the early stages of the play, we are also drilling some Granite Wash wells and a couple of horizontal Mississippi and oil wells in existing fields that we have in the sectors Panhandle and Oklahoma. At Range, our strategy is to grow production with one of the best oil and cost structures in the business and to build in high grade our inventory.", "In addition to adding high quality place like the Marcellus Nora and the Barnett to our portfolio will sold out of the Gulf of Mexico, Ohio, New York, Fuhrman Mascho and other fields and net result is shown on our website in our latest IR presentation. In 2007, although we have decreased our well count from about 14,000 wells to 6,000 wells, production from 2007 to our 2010 forecast is projected to increase from 320 million per day to about 490 million per day.", "Quite simply in 2007, we decreased our well counts by 57% while increasing our projected production by 52%. Bottom line we are a much more efficient company. The combination of adding higher quality plays and focusing our people and capital there, well selling relatively high cost, low growth periods have led to better production in reserve replacement, lower F&D, lower LOE and better rates of return. This in addition to our resource potential which is ten times our current reserve base coupled with one of the best teams in the business will lead to you an exciting future for Range. Back to you, John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Jeff. That was a terrific update. Looking to the remainder of 2009, we see continued strong operating results here at Range. For the second quarter, we are looking for production to average, second quarter production for 2010 to average 450 to 455 million a day representing a 10% increase year-over-year.", "The second quarter production reflected sales, the Fuhrman Mascho properties last June, the New York properties last December and the Ohio properties in March of this year. So, the 10% second quarter growth target equates to 18% after adjusting for the property sales. However, given that we sold the Ohio properties right at the end of the March it is unlikely we will be able to make up the full amount of the Ohio production loss of 25 million a day in the second quarter.", "As a result it is likely our straight 29 consecutive quarters of sequential production growth will come to a halt. As I've said in the past, I would not be disappointed to see this to retain if that was in our best interest. Clearly the Ohio property sale wasn't our best interest given the terrific price we received.", "For the year, we still anticipate with our production growth target of 13% even after accounting for the property sale. Now that we close the Ohio property sale, I will take a moment to look at the impact of our divestiture program. Over the past three years, we have reduced our well count by roughly 6000 wells. This represents 57% of our well count, but only approximately 9% of our production reserves.", "The properties we sold were more mature higher cost properties. The good news is that while we were selling our mature higher cost properties, we were focusing on our capital into higher return projects like the Barnett Shale, the Nora area and the Marcellus Shale. As a result despite of the asset sales, our production reserves continued to increase.", "Over the same three year period that we saw, our well accounts decline 57%. Our production rose 52%. As a result Range is a much more efficient company. We would like to say we are doing more or less. By less, we mean less well lower find development cost, lower operating cost etcetera. The first quarter results partially reflects the slower cost structure, which should continue in the subsequent quarters especially in the second, third quarters after the Ohio sale.", "The Ohio property is no longer running through our income statement. Over the meantime, this will have a significant positive impact or NAV per share. This is critical to generally attractive returns in a low gas price environment. In addition by having fewer wells and properties and more compact asset base, we can better focus our technical team on higher return projects and hopefully make those projects even better.", "Lastly, one of Range's hallmarks is to keep things simple. By having zero wells and properties, Range is by far a simpler company allowing the Range team to focus more on driving up our per share value. I believe the timing of the Ohio sale as important even the outlook for natural gas prices and the amount of gas in storage as we entered the 2009 winter heating season.", "We made the decision to accelerate the timing of the Ohio sale into the first quarter 2010 versus later in the year. Conversely we did the opposite with regards to our 2010 capital program and that we intentionally designed the program where less capital would be spend in the first and second quarters and more capital in the third and fourth quarters.", "As a result in the fourth quarter, we spend only 30% of the 2010 capital budget versus 32% in the first quarter of 2009. The combination of getting Ohio sale closed in the first quarter and slower spending puts us in a terrific position for the remainder of the year. As Jeff mentioned, one of the key elements that is having a positive impact on our results this year related to our capital efficiency.", "In the past several years, we spent considerable capital in the Marcellus play without seen much of return. The gain in 2009 this all changes the first phase of the infrastructure was completed and production began to ramp up. As our Marcellus production continues to ramp up in 2010, we are seeing the capital efficiency having an ever increasing impact.", "For the remainder of 2010 and for 2011, this will be the more evident as we get the capital efficiency impact to the Marcellus ramping up as well as the full benefit of the asset sale. Because of our drilling success so far this year completing the Ohio sale, our lower cost structure and our hedges in place, we are confident that we will achieve our 2010 production growth target as well as rating our Marcellus exit rate of 180 million to 200 million a day by year-end because of the terrific infrastructure progress we are making both the Southwest and Northeast portions of the play, our goal of reaching an exit rate of 360 million to 400 million a day net in 2010 and 2011 looks very, very good.", "What gives me added confidence is the quality and the size of our team in Pittsburgh. As Jeff mentioned, we now have over 200 employees in Pittsburgh working on the Marcellus full time. This is roughly double the number of employees compared to this time last year. One item, Roger touched on is our current hedging position.", "As you probably noted we have increased our 2011 natural gas hedges is 51% of our anticipated production at a floor price of $5.73 and a comp of 683. Our fair tails [ph] are fairly simple and that we wanted the blocking cash flows that we could fund our capital fund program for 2010 and for 2011.", "By many of you I'm concerned about the number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S. I'm also concerned with the ready access to capital that the industry enjoy. While I'm convinced the industry will ultimately adjust capital spending to fit gas prices, we are taken the timing of the industry response of the table by locking in floor on half of our gas production for 2011.", "Speaking to the industry's ready access to capital, there have been several large joint ventures in the Marcellus off late. Clearly the Anadarko Missouri transaction and the Atlas Reliance transaction are starting to see as one to where to apply those valuation to Range's Marcellus acreage position, one can justify the Range stock price more than double what it trades today.", "This is great news and that others are beginning to understand and pay for the superior economics that the Marcellus Shale play has achieved. We think overtime as more wells are drilled and more to play at the risk that in acreage joint venture prices will increase. I remember mainly people saying Chesapeake deal with (inaudible) 5800 per acre was terrific in that range to consider the same.", "Just 15 months later, we've seen material reliance payable 14,000 per acre roughly 2.5 times what (inaudible) will pay. While Chesapeake, and Anadarko, and Atlas had balance in company's specific reasons to enter into their joint ventures, we believe joint ventures are what they really are which is a sale of asset.", "As we've said before, we preferred to sell our lower quality raw material asset not our higher quality higher growth asset. Most importantly, we believe that as the Marcellus continue to be de-risk by more drilling that the acreage prices is in the better part of the play will continue to increase.", "We believe our job is to maximize the value of Range's assets for the benefit of our shareholders. That been said, we will consider joint ventures for possibly selling a portion of our Marcellus acreage. However, we want to receive fair value, which we believe will be higher as the play continues to building risk.", "Additionally, we believe we have the highest quality acreage position in play. The best infrastructure arrangement and the best technical team, therefore we believe if we monetize any portion of our position we should receive a premium price. In summary, looking at Range today, we have the largest drilling inventory in our history.", "We now believe we have roughly 30 Tcf of resource potential, which equates to nearly 10 times of our existing crude reserves. We have obviously a cost structure after the asset sale that's going to be very low. So, while we are excited about the growth potential range, we are intently focused on delivering this quarter.", "Our first quarter of 2010 is a shine example of this commitment by all the employees of Range. With that operator, let's open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Pinkerton. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Mr. Marshall Carver with Capital One Southcoast. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "All right, just a couple of questions. The St. Louis and Stron [ph] areas where you drilled some successful wells, how many locations or net locations do you have in each of those areas?", "Jeff Ventura", "Well, St. Louis is very early for us, but we've got a good acreage position that we are building. We got close to 40,000 growth acres and we think approaching 250 potential growth locations, so it can be very impactful. We are going slow. It's early on, but so far we are encouraged by what we see and it's particularly it's just great economics, $1.3 million for a little over 2 Bcfe coupled with the fact that you got an oil component, wells have come online and 2 billion with 50 barrels to 100 barrels of oil per day.", "The gas is relatively rich even after that 1080 BCU. So, we are excited by the play before our guidance generated up there. It's early on and then in the strong not as much potential so that when you look at the acreage you're having and things we could acquire and again it's early on in the play that we drilled several great wells. IP is of 300 barrels to 700 barrels per day rift out with in aggregate. It could approach 100 wells overtime if we continue to successfully grow and acquire a few things that we see. So, the guys are doing a good job not only in driving up production in the Marcellus and in making better and better wells, better economics, keeping all eyes on the ball there, but the guys in the other division are extracting a lot of value out of our old properties in old areas.", "Marshall Carver \u2013 Capital One Southcoast", "Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.", "John Pinkerton", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.", "Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "John, I guess you just mentioned you potentially would consider a JV in the Marcellus or some acreage sales for the right price. Seems like a bit of a shift from what you have been saying in the past. Can you talk a little about strategy behind this? Is this more of a value unlocker for Range because it appears as though you have plenty of capital to execute your near terms plans here?", "John Pinkerton", "Yes Leo, it's a great question. And I appreciate you asking it. Maybe I wasn't \u2013 as I should have been, but historically our strategy is always been at Range. We are going to do what's in the shareholders best interest, and therefore, I didn't think, our team didn't think doing JV is a relatively low prices make any sense because like as you said, we really didn't need the capital to exploit it. As things move along in the play and clearly Chesap did their deal at 5800, Atlas and Anadarko did their deals at 14,000 or better.", "We think those prices are going to continue to move up. So, over some period of time we think that the price that repay will come closer to what we think fair value is and so we will continue to monitor that and if we think we are getting something that we believe is in fair value and its NAV accretive when you take the time value into account. We think that is in our shareholders best interest and we will \u2013 we've look at it very closely.", "We consider that and take it to the Board to get their input. So, again it all comes back to driving up on NAV per share. So, if we can do that don't screw up the balance sheet, will screw up the simplicity of the company materially will look at those for the best interest for the shareholders and we will move forward with that and as you can imagine with all the different things that add there, we had lots of discussions with lots of people. We will continue to have lots of discussions with lots of people and we will do the right thing.", "Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Just switching gears here, in your press release you talked about seeing some encouraging things in your initial horizontal well in the Utica and the Upper Devonian. Have you production tested these wells or flow tested them at this time here?", "Jeff Ventura", "Yes, we have. When we talked about on the last quarter because we have drilled them and logged them and we are encouraged by what we saw based on ETS launch and such, and shows we have now drilled in case tested on, and in the press release, we mentioned that we are going to be looking a lot. So, clearly refine gas, but in general with any specifics we are going to hold that pipe very early on in the play. Importantly, I think I just want to reemphasize that we think the most perspective part for Upper Devonian Shale is primarily in the Southwestern portion of the State.", "Actually, they have the right thickness in large properties of making perspective and we are looking at all the various things that make Shale plays work. And in the Utica Shale, we think it's primarily perspective on the Western half of the State. The good news is we've got 1.3 million acres in the State from primarily all in Pennsylvania of which 600,000 acres are in the Southwest portion of the play. So, a lot of our acreages perspective for that is the big upside.", "We are encouraged by what we see early on, but it's early. We've drilled a couple of more wells probably by the end of the year and like we were with the Marcellus a few years back. We will keep it relatively applied and make sure we capture that. Therefore, our shareholders, it's good news as a lot of it is stacked on our existing acreage. So, we've captured a lot already, but Rodney said there would be things would want to fill in.", "Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. One other thing; you guys mentioned in your press release as you're taking your EURs up on your Marcellus from 3 Bcf to 4 Bcf to 4 Bcf to 5 Bcf for your \"high\" graded acreage, is your high graded acreage \u2013 is that just the same thing as core 900,000 acres?", "Jeff Ventura", "Yes and our acreage, gas is again 1.3 million acres basically within the fairway 900,000 that is high graded in it. It's really well positioned I've mentioned before there's been over 600 wells in the Southwest , Range wells and others both vertical and one horizontal, a huge portion of the acreage in the Southwest .", "The other 300,000 acres in the Northeast is predominantly a lay down where Anadarko and Mitsui did their deal. They haven't put it up specifically but a lot of its like homing, plus or minus accounting on either side like Bradford, Lycoming in there. So we feel, given the industries result to date that the very high quality acreage as evidenced by the quality of wells and evidenced by the deals that John mentioned.", "Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. I guess the last question for you guys. Obviously your direct operating costs LOE looked great this quarter. It sounds like that's going to drop again next quarter. Can you give us any kind of ballpark as to where that can go this year?", "John Pinkerton", "Yes, I think Roger mentioned that it's going to drop another nickel or so. So it will be in the mid-to upper $0.60 next quarter.", "Leo Mariani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks a lot guys.", "John Pinkerton", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.", "Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company", "Good morning Dave.", "John Pinkerton", "Good morning Dave.", "Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company", "Or I guess afternoon. I apologize. Let's see. Just thinking about your drilling activity over the next few years and more specifically as you reiterated the $360 million to $400 million of production by year end 2011 out of the Marcellus. Can you delineate what portion of that is going to be coming out of the Northwest PA portion and what portion would be coming, obviously the balance of the Southwestern portion?", "Jeff Ventura", "We can guide you somewhat. Through the end of this, we're not going to have the Lycoming County from Northeast until the end of this year. So basically and that's in almost all of the $180 million to $200 million per day net \u2013 and again, I want to emphasize the word net \u2013 will be coming from the Southeast and predominantly from the wet gas portion, almost all of that.", "When you project going into next year, a lot of our drilling is going to be in the Southwest although we'll start to ramp up the Northeast. So the vast majority of it in those early years is going to be coming from the Southwest and from the wet gas part of it. Beyond that we'll start to see a good contribution from the other areas.", "Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company", "Okay. And diving into your hedges a little bit, when I looked at the 2011 hedges, if we just run oil production relatively flattish for you guys or liquids portions, whatnot, it ends up being over 90% hedged. So I'm gathering that there is \u2013 relative to any announcements you made about Stron [ph] and other areas, that we should be anticipating an uptick in the liquids production as well. Can you just give us some additional color there?", "John Pinkerton", "Yes, that's intuitive. If you just look at the delta change in the liquids, our liquids production is going to go streaming up this year and next year and next year for example we think the liquids production will be more than twice of what the oil production is and be heading north from there. So pretty intuitive question and again we really kind of circled back around with what Jeff was talking about in terms of the wet gas area of the Marcellus and in particular, when you're in a low price gas environment, a high price oil environment, the benefit of being in wet-gas is dramatic and so I mean, again as part of the message or the madness in terms of how we developed our acreage position and what we're doing and why we're doing what we're doing is well encompassing all that.", "Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company", "Okay. So if I look at percentage hedges right now and I just try to project growth, I think the same quarter percentages are what you're going to be targeting for 2011 if I want to project the oil and liquids growth that I should be thinking about?", "John Pinkerton", "I'm not following you completely. I just \u2013 it's really hard to hedge liquids and most people who hedge liquids, they simply hedge oil. So we look at it as a basket. Clearly our biggest percentage of our production is going to be natural gas. So we're kind of focused on that, especially given where it is today. If you want to get into the details of the oil versus the NGL I suggest you call Rodney Waller and he can run you through all those detailed numbers after the call.", "Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company", "That's great. That's actually very helpful, and primarily I was focusing more on the oil component piece just as you have shown those hedges for 2011. But one last thing on liquids if I can sneak it in. Everybody is obviously trying to take up their liquids components in this current environment. You guys have great position there. How are you thinking about that? Do we worry that liquids over time become pressured from pricing standpoint as everybody is seeing that same sort deviation in value and obviously wants to capitalize on it?", "John Pinkerton", "Again, that's a very intuitive question. It's something that our marketing team has really looked at very carefully. When you look at the Marcellus, the wet-gas area is a relatively small percentage of the total acreage in the Marcellus. So therefore the liquids component and the liquids that's going to be generated from the Marcellus, when you look at the entire play, it's not as big as I think some people have anticipated.", "That being said, one of the reasons why we chose to do our venture with Mark West is their expertise, when it comes to liquids and how you distribute the liquids up in the Northeast and we'll give you an example. Within 12 months we'll have a propane line in and we'll be selling our propane 12 to 24 through a pipeline. We're putting a rail for it and so instead of trucking the liquids we'll be rail-carrying the liquids out and the good news is, almost all of that will be used in the Northeast. There is some very good markets in the Northeast for all that stuff.", "So we analyzed that and don't see that there is any issue. In fact one of the good things that's happening is on a relative basis on liquids everything, we're seeing a higher price for liquids as they come out of Marcellus and we are in other places because the market is so robust in the Northeast versus the other parts there is more competition and more liquids coming onto the market. So that's kind of how we look at it on a 50,000 level.", "Jeff Ventura", "And just to be crystal clear adding onto what John is saying, the wet-gas part of the Marcellus of the total play is small but Range sort of dominates that wet-gas part which is an advantage we have. A big part of what we have is a small part of the total play for the industry.", "Rodney Waller", "And one thing I can do is direct you to probably Mark West's website. Randy Nickerson made a presentation last week at Doug East Marcellus Midstream conference in Pittsburg showing what the total demand of Appalachian products were or each of the components built in the winter and the summer markets and showed what our production would be that is going to be largely, maybe a third of capacity is it possibly weak during the three to four years.", "So therefore I think the mid information about the market being overrun, to reiterate what John said is because the markets we are selling to in Appalachia have to get all the labels out of the Gulf Coast and pay a transportation charge for it, we can compete very competitively with those. We can avoid the large transportation charges coming out of the Gulf. So it kind of ensures a ready market for us and people, they really are able to take that as long as we can give them consistent quality and consistent quantities.", "Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company", "That's very helpful, guys. I appreciate the additional color there.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Ron Mills with Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.", "Ron Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice", "Hi guys. Just a question on leasing and lease expirations. I know you have plus or minus 15% of your budgets going towards leasing. Can you add a little direction in terms of how much of that is new leasing and is most of that directed in continuing to fill out your Marcellus area and how much is dedicated to re-upping leases with current lessees?", "John Pinkerton", "Hi Ron. This is John. Pretty good game last night, huh?", "Ron Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice", "Yes. I think the fix was in.", "John Pinkerton", "Great question, Ron. We, and let me just start at a high level. Then I'll work down. We haven't been by any what I'd call trend acreage in the play for two years. What we've really been doing, and the reason is because we grow a bunch of wells and we drill our first \u2013 completed our first well in '04 and we drilled a bunch of wells in '05 and '06 in areas that we thought were really, really, really perspective.", "So we immediately started buying acreage in there for a $50 to $100 an acre and it moves up to $500 an acres. So in most of acreage we've got relatively cheaply and most of them have very low royalty burden. So we're in terrific shape. What we're doing now, what we've done the last couple of years is we're simply filling in the holes in those big blocks of acreage we've got to try to continue to block our acreage position.", "We believe strongly and the Barnett is a perfect example, the Fayetteville is a good example and the Woodford is a very good example, if you can block up your acreage it really helps dramatically in rolling your costs as you go forward and it's everything from pipeline costs to road costs to infrastructure costs. All those costs go down and the economics of the play go up.", "So our budget this year is to do a number of things, one filling the hole. The only thing is we've got a huge average position, 1.3 million acres. We are not going to hold all that acreage from drilling. So we have to decide each year, what do we want to hold, what do we want to let go.", "The good news is everything that we've wanted to hold this year, we've already really, that we haven't drilled. So that's already done and some of what we want to do next year has already been done as well. So part of the budget is going to filling the hole. The other part is going to be really from some of the acreage that we're not going to get through currently.", "The other thing we're doing also is and I think the industry \u2013 it took a while for the industry to kind of catch up with us quite frankly but there is a lot of companies and a lot of good companies that have acreage that is spread out all over the play and as they drill wells, they start becoming, they start developing their little core areas.", "So we've talked to a lot of different companies about spreading acreage and we'll say 15,000 acres over one of our core areas for 15,000 acres they have in one of their core areas assuming they're relatively equal in terms of quality and royalty burdens and exploration.", "So we've done that. We're going to continue to do that. It is something that we think again will allow Range, in a big way in investing industries to block up the acreage and make it more valuable. Acreage that is blocked up is much more valuable than acreage that's not blocked up. And a perfect example of that is Matsui and Reliance paying $14,000 an acre for these big blocked up areas.", "You don't have to pay $14,000 an acre to drive at least 100 to 200 to 300 acres spread out all over the state of Pennsylvania. Those are still going for values much, much, much lower and quite frankly they should because the value creation is a combination of blocking up the acreage in good areas, having a really good technical team that can execute. So hopefully that answers your question.", "Ron Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice", "It does. And then I think, Jeff, normally you walk through your production on an area by area basis. Was curious if you had to breakdown Marcellus versus Nora versus the Southwest division?", "Jeff Ventura", "If you look at the major plays, we're looking at; we're on track to hit our $180 million to $200 million in the Marcellus. Today we're approximately $130 million per day net, something like that. The Barnett is working at $120 million to $125 million, Nora, about $65 million per day. Those will be top three and the rest of it is a lot of legacy price-gas standard of oil production.", "Ron Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice", "And then in terms of the timing of production ramp, particularly in the Marcellus, obviously you'll have some come on at the end of the year in Northeast Pennsylvania. But in terms of March from $130 million a day to the $180 million to $200 million a day, how consistent is that over the remaining three quarters or are there major infrastructure bottlenecks being relieved at a particular date?", "Jeff Ventura", "No, I mean infrastructure in the Southwest predominantly will be there. Because of the fact, some of that \u2013 we're doing a combination of pad drilling to drive up rates and to be efficient, coupled with step out wells and things to delineate. So when you pad drill, what we do is we'll drill the wells and then we complete them all at the same time.", "So it's a little bit lumpy that way, which is typical of all the shale plays out there. But with the guys that are focused, they know where we are and there will be, March would be a straight line but I feel comfortable and confident we'll hit our $180 million to $200 million in the Marcellus net and we'll get our 12% growth for the year corporately and do it with a great cost structure.", "Ron Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice", "And then lastly, the Granite Wash play, you outlined in your operational portion of your release, that's obviously a different play than what a lot of other operators are talking about in that area. What kind of running room do you have I guess along Leo's lines in that Granite Wash vertical play?", "Jeff Ventura", "Yes, our play is different. It's a good point. That's why we put a little color on it in the release. The wells are on the order of $1.2 million on the order of 1 Bcf to 2 Bcf. And importantly there is an oil component. IP is again about $2 million per day, 50 to 100 barrels of oil per day with that and very importantly per day the gas of 1,240 Btu. So you get the oil up and you get the oil revenue, also your gas price of 1.24. So that's the huge plus. And very low risk.", "The other part about a lot of our areas, particularly the Panhandle but as well as our Stron [ph] areas as well, they're in fact pay areas and I'm just talking about and I think every one of those St. Louis wells we've drilled so far, they are up full pays, and with our Granite Wash wells, a lot of time to catch other plays as well. Stron [ph] well is the same. They're up all full pays with those. I'm just talking about the reserves in the main horizon. So it's good to be in areas that have stacked pays, a lot of hydrocarbon in place with a high quality team that just does a great job of continuing to get more and more out of those order properties.", "Ron Mills \u2013 Johnson Rice", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. David Heikkinen with Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering & Holt", "Thanks guys. Just wanted to get into firm transportation and just the thought of taking gas into Canada as we have seen some proposals in that direction and your willingness to try to think about opening up new markets for both gas and then ethane as well as the propane side.", "John Pinkerton", "Well this is John. Let me \u2013 I'll talk a little bit. Then I'll let Jeff and Rodney chime in a little bit. Again, back to the Marcellus, we've been thinking about kind of markets and where we want to be for a number of years now and we've got a great team in Pittsburg, very high quality team that's been in the basin for many, many years.", "That is directing us on the ground for us and a couple of things. One, just picking the right partners to do the midstream on and I think we've done that feel very good about it. We're not burdening our capital or our balance sheet with those \u2013 they're paying for and ultimately we'll a fee, transportation and compression fee to get those volumes to the biggest pieces of the pipe.", "Once you get to the get to the bigger pieces of pipe and the good news with that is there is a lot of big pieces of pipe running around in Appalachia. I think five of those seven largest gas pipelines in United States went right through the Marcellus shale play. So you've got the big tow roads.", "So it's really a question of just building the feeder roads onto the tow roads. That's much different in the Barnett where we had to build several big tow roads to get it out of the Fort Worth basin. So that's a plus. As you think through that, we have taken some firm transportation of several pieces of pipe.", "Our strategy again is simple, is that we want to be able to have flexibility and move our gas to different areas in Appalachia. We don't know like a lot of people where all the gas bottlenecks are going to be over time. So our idea is to build in flexibility by buying firm transportation that gets us a different delivery point where we can then deliver gas.", "If you think about longer term, the Marcellus drills out like a lot of the people think. There is going to be some gas-on-gas competition within the basin. So what you want to do is you want to divert gas and have firm transportations on different pieces of pipe, big pipes so that you have flexibility in terms of how you market your gas and what kind of premium the NYMEX are getting to different in different city gates and that's what we've done and we've brought some firm transportation on a number of different pieces of pipe. That being said, I think you've got to be really, really careful about firm transportation in that it's a little bit like office space.", "These that don't have enough at any one point in time, either they have got too much or you don't have enough. The perfect example of that is the Barnett Shale now and that there is several larger producers in the Barnett that firm transportation on a big pipeline that goes over to a cartage and I think they are paying $0.60, you buy it in the open markets for more around the $0.05 a dine, $0.70 [ph]. So, you can't have too much and it's hitting that balance between having the right amount and then the doing the other thing.", "The other thing that we have been doing, again we have been productively doing it for several years, is reaching out to some of the bigger users of gas in the basin and developing relationships with them, because some of them have firm transportation and pieces of pipe as well and so we have entered into transactions with them to deliver gas on a firm basis to their firm transportation were quite frankly they are paying for it.", "Now they are making us obviously there is arbitrage here that we are trying not to have them jam us with the whole amount, but again we have developed relationships there as well. So, again this kind of a high level I think simply we have really seen it through this.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering & Holt", "High level as you think about that for a basin that you are dominating some regions, and what is a good percentage of 400 million a day in a year-and-a-half that should be firm versus not \u2013 I am trying to think about \u2013 you're going to be one of the capacity shippers, so just trying to get an idea how important that is going to be to you.", "John Pinkerton", "Well I think we would want I mean again that's a rough question, but we would want at least half of your gas to be on firm and what we also want to do is develop relationships with these other big users of gas out there. What's happened in the basin and I am getting into the weeds a little bit but I think it's important and then historically the basin never, another producers in the basin ever produce large quantities of gas that some of these big end users could use. So, they want to these marketing companies are aggregate and the gas to them.", "That's all changing now and now they are coming to our range and some of the other big players in the Marcellus again be able to deliver large quantities of gas. So, and still are going through some of the aggregate is not even go directly to the end users and I actually like it because they get a much more of a connection and where the gas is coming from and they can quite frankly, because to some degree you are cutting out the middle-man, you can get better deal off of your gas on both sides of equation. So, I think it's a combination of having your own firm transportation but also having the relationships in the contract for some of the big users.", "Again it's a portfolio effect and then we will have some of our gas uninterruptible because again you don't want to have too much firm transportation. So, I think it's a portfolio, understanding where the end users are and the other thing is that marketing gas in the Southwest is much different than in the North East. The Southwest has a lot more pipeline infrastructure than the North East, especially the gathering side and that's where Rodney and the team up in Pittsburg have done a terrific job of really taking through that and putting us where I think is in a superior position.", "Rodney Waller", "From a simple point of view it just has a big advantage still versus gas and the Rockies or gas in the Gulf Coast or in South Texas or wherever it may come from and you don't have to pay the transport, it's the biggest markets in the U.S.", "John Pinkerton", "Yeah, I mean there is some city gates, Washington, D.C., Boston, New York City. All these I mean if you can get gas there, they are selling for gas for over $2 Mcf or over NYMEX. So, to the extent you can get it there cheap and not to have to pay the frac. Obviously, you're net backs are going to be better and so again that, therein lies the advantage of having gas in the Appalachian Basin.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering & Holt", "And then can you talk some about the JV side and to make an accretive deal one of the best ways to do that is to figure out acceleration and does that lean you towards an operator that actually would be picking up \u2013 you won't to want give up operator ship so \u2013 or do you or where you could actually \u2013 they could bring rigs to part of the play or something that's not going to be as important to Range or is it just purely the financial that comes in and gives you the capital to allow you to double the rig count or really do an acceleration of well count?", "John Pinkerton", "I think every deal is different and I think, we have talked both sides of that equation. People who just at least an argue and their main asset is money and then we talked to others that are dying to get into play there are very technical competent or quite frankly we're already in the play just want a bigger position and so we talk to both sides and continue to think through those and I think both of those are interesting in that regard I think you have hit the nail in the hammer. Obviously to the extent that we are looking forward to just money that's a different JV partner to the extent outside of the some of our core areas let's say we have got what I would call some fringe acreage that we could pull together with an operator that we have a lot of confidence then yeah it would make sense and argue to go ahead and take that acreage pool it with them and then must let 13 developer.", "As soon as \u2013 as long as our team had some kind of input into how you drill the wells and how design them, Whose drilling rig it is and that kind of stuff I could care less who is land team is putting together the units is really not all that important. It's really is how you drill the wells and design it and what not, so again I think both of those are different and its and our team we sit around for hours and hours and hours discussing those exact points.", "But why not let Jeff kind of bury in on that as well.", "Jeff Ventura", "Exactly let me bury in a little bit, if you look at it we have run a number of cases looking at our developing our acreage position from now really through depletion. We run a number of scenarios of faster flow in between joint venture all kinds of different options and what we think maximizes our share price because that's what it is all about is doing good job be a good storage for the shareholders of which we are totally aligned with is because that's where the bulk of our network is. But to be specific the path we're on now we look at that constantly and periodically to optimize this.", "We are currently at 13 rigs by the end of this year we will be at 16, by the end of next year 2011, 24 and in our IR material we say the full development will be 50 plus rig but I mean if you look at the trajectory of 13 now going 24 to be simplistic about it cost 48 or doubling it again but potentially its early and we haven't said that yet and there will be a function of lot of things. We are along a path that we think generally it's a tremendous NAV on par or better than the thing that you see with some of the recent market like John said if you use the market transaction of a $1 striker you can pack to it like share prices more than double where we are today.", "You can calculate any devalues that are significantly high with that trajectory, so we are on high point on that thing, we are not on a full page but however we will look at any point in time are we going to be better by JV, we are doing with Southwestern did a few years back selling a piece off or partnering on some of our current acreages, where that might be fringed us, it might be core for somebody else. We will look at all those opportunities because clearly we want to pack them on values of our company.", "David Heikkinen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering & Holt", "As we look at acreage values versus the joint ventures, for your assets you can get values that are 2X pretty easily what the joint ventures have been done on a value per acre and that acceleration case is probably the most compelling thing that we see in the Marcellus particularly given the size and scope of plays, why it is so important. Thanks, guys.", "Jeff Ventura", "David I think just to reiterate, the one thing I would like to just put out there for everybody is there has not been any material acreage JVs done in the wet gas area and if you just think through the economics in the wet gas area and in today's economics even using the NYMEX curve for ten year for both oil and gas. Your acreage values in the wet gas area when you run the numbers and thus coming back and view all the stuff and all the hocks pocks and divide and whatever you want to call it.", "It's substantially hard, so you really need to careful when you are looking acreage values in the JV deals to think through kind of what makes sense in valuations when it comes to the wet gas areas versus the dry gas. So, that's my, I will get off the soap box and will get to another question.", "Operator", "Thank you. We are nearing the end of our conference today. We will go to Mr. Dan McSpirit of BMO Capital Markets with our final question.", "Dan McSpirit \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Gentlemen, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. We have observed off late here gas companies chasing the oil story by buying properties in places like South Texas. Can you share your thoughts on this trend whether or not you think it is too late for some of these companies to change their stripes and if it is not too late, do we see range do the same to diversify its asset base at least in terms of the hydrocarbons produced or is that just a ridiculous thought?", "Jeff Ventura", "Jeff let me start with some technical thoughts on that and then I will turn it over to John for more global thoughts. One when you look at range, one of the advantages we have is \u2013 we have discovered what maybe the largest gas field in the U.S. and now we have the dominant part of it plus we have maybe the best economies because of the wet gas part.", "Now, when you look at the growth opportunities we have and with that in passing 600 wells from the Southwest is de-risk over 12 or 13 piece to it already, with that kind of inventory in hand de-risk over 600 wells and like John said our first well was back in 2004.", "We are saying that we are going to be at 180 to 20 this year, 360 to 400 end of next year and with that kind of volume of 12 pieces with the opportunity that could be easily doubled at. I believe that in time we will break the Bcf to 2 Bcf per day.", "What I believe we have the best economics of almost any play out there particularly any gas play and again we had in liquid. So, we are in a great position, we don't have to chase things I think get our growth and get it at low cost. So, I think we have got a lot of multi-year baked in low cost growth of which we are ramping up rapidly approaching 50 rigs in order to capture NPV.", "So, that's a comment one, comment two would be, a lot of people are and we have been talking about this and we have a South team, that's out there looking at different plays. A lot of people we are talking about getting into oil field, I am talking pure oil shales not the Balkan, Balkan doesn't count because they got conventional reservoirs and you may extend it.", "But the industry now is shifted to hey we are not going to not only going to look at the dry gas shale's which were a breakthrough a few years back to the wet gas areas which are hot now and again we are thinking in some of the shale's there is no wet gas and some of the shale plays out there, they are Fayetteville or Haynesville they are basically dry gas point. So you can't chase it everywhere, you have to be in the shale which has that and you have to be in the \u2013 and Illinois has it but has tight quality rock in the right part of it which the Marcellus does.", "Companies now are just been last two or three months are going one more step, now they are saying hey we are going to look at oil sales and then a lot of people have rushed into that oil price or high gas prices or low, here is the new nirvana. That may work or it may not work but it's clearly has significantly higher risk, as an engineer when you are starting to move gas molecules through nanodarcy route and it's not just can you get through port route it's like the big break to tell you can move oil molecule through an nanodarcy port route.", "In the long run it doesn't matter, what matters is comes to flow equations with the safer that curve going to be over a year or two or five and 10 years and how much do you have to pay out from going forward and the industry hasn't shown you that in a big way that they can make that economic. It may work, it may not work I mean at least we have a lot of low risk expecting things that we think we can drive that up for years to come.", "We will be opportunistic, we will look at plays but we are not going to jump at the latest fad I think like a lot other companies have done which may or may not work, but I am just saying from a technical perspective in my opinion, you have changed the risk profile when you are going from gas to oil because if it's got for the oil and the order of magnitude higher than gas which is going to make it lot larger long term to flow through that low quality rock. So, that was my comment so far I will turn it to John for the more global stuff.", "John Pinkerton", "Dan, good question and something that we are obviously talking about a lot as well here internally. I think this and I kind of what Jeff said I think if you sit back and look today if we had any 8000 for the oil wells that would come on at 4000 barrels a day I can assure you we could be rushing up and drilling those given the relative prices but most of those there is very few of those that exist today and people are trying to find more but they are really very few of those kinds of fields and as we all know most of the oil in the U.S. was produced by Rockefeller and his friends back \u2013 a long, long time.", "If you think about it kind of simplistically, if I were out in the acquisition market today and going to buy reserves what would I buy. I got to tell you I would then buy gas, not oil because I think oil is trading at the high end and gas you are getting at trading at the low end. Again I think some why Exxon bought XTO. They thought they were buying a resource base that was at the lower end its long-term of view of gas I mean prices and the NYMEX curve, I am not talking about this year but if you look at NYMEX curve for 10 or 20 years it would suggest that. So, if I am buying reserve today I am buying natural gas versus oil.", "On the other side if I had a big oil field and if I had two places to spend money and one was oil and one was gas I would simply run the economies, figure out which one is going to generate the highest return over the period of time and do that and I have the same company and our friends in Newfield shifted some of their capital dollars over to existing oil fields they own and are seeing up that development. I think that is very prudent and I think Newfield is a great company and I think it makes absolute sense, where I think what Jeff said is absolutely right though to jump out of lower risk projects and to jump, push your money in through dramatically higher risk projects chasing oil can be a two edge story.", "So, if you are good at that and it works you are going to over perform. But if you don't then you are going weigh you're underperformed and so therein lies is the issues is that there is the risk associated with that strategy. I love the strategy because what I am hopeful for is all these guys do jump in the oil that, the natural gas rig account continues to move down.", "We had some sanity comeback into the market last week and some natural gas rigs decline, hallelujah. So, I am hopeful as that trend continues, more people jump in the oil and shift things that natural gas supply will come down and that we will see gas as far as move back up. With the combination of stronger economic growth, more electric generation in the U.S. being developed with natural gas versus the nasty stuff we are using today and the reduction in natural gas rig count then you will see prices move back up and maybe not as long as some but I have been in this business for a long time and I keep on saying that care for low prices as low prices.", "But and I think energy will readjust these gas prices and especially I think one point is important is as you look at the hedges, the industry has in place today for 2010 the gas hedges haven't seen the number, we haven't done analysis specific but I have read some analysis by analyst.", "We are about 70% maybe even 75% on hedges for 2010 or actually for first half of the year. So, as those hedges roll of here in about two months then you are going to see the rig count even fall down more aggressively that would make sense to me. Again one of the reasons why we hedge jumped from 23% to 51% for 2011 is I am a little concerned with the available access of capital assets, the ready access of capital for just about anybody that wants in our business. Obviously just a little concerned that there may be that market may stay open longer than I think it should and that some companies will jump out there and grab some capital and continue to drill in an environment that they wouldn't normally if they didn't have that ready access to capital.", "So, I think that's kind of gives you our summary in terms of how we view all that, doesn't mean we are right. Our view of it is like Jeff said we found a giant gas field, it has really good economics even at 450 gas, so and we think we substantially de-risk it.", "So, we don't have a great desire to have to jump out and do something else. We're making good returns to our shareholders and we think we will continue to do that even if gas stays in to $5 to $6 range for a long time. So we feel good about it, so, I think you will see us not do anything that's high risk if I should put that way, where is an acquisition or a new play idea.", "Jeff Ventura", "Let me add one another technical comment, long answer to your question but it's an important question is and I just want to caution people on IP's, a lot of people talk about IP's are jumping to oil shale, I will use Eagle Ford for an example, and if you look at the oil part of the Eagle Ford very few wells in there and there are couple of high rate wells and as you come up in Eagle Ford from the dry gas window to the wet gas for the oil you go basically from a true shale to basically a carbonate and it's a black looking rock but when you look at the mineralogy's it's really a carbonate. And when you come up into the shallow part in fact there you have the Eagle Ford, (inaudible), and then Austin Chalk right and a fairly narrow package.", "When you look at those early wells and time will tell clearly you can get some high rates if you get into fracs there and now against the Chalk in fact some \u2013 like I said when you move the Eagle Ford out in some of the shallow areas basically it's a carbonate which is like things what a Chalk is and same family. So, there is no question if you get into the good fractured area you can get good and as it relates the question is long-term. Once you drain the fracture system what's the matrix going to feed into the fractures there and that's really going to tell the tale on what's the rate of return and the economies to your well.", "So, again those things may work, they may not work but I am just saying it's a different risk profile and the good news is given the inventory we have in the economies of our project even down to extremely low gas prices we can just stay focused on driving Marcellus up and keeping our cost down and improving our wells. Even as 250 gas and $60 oil, our Marcellus oil and wet gas areas in Southwest still generate a rate of return of about 35%.", "So, that we will stay focused on.", "Dan McSpirit \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Got it. John and Jeff, I appreciate your thoughts. Gentlemen, that's all I have.", "Operator", "Thank you, Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's question and session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Pinkerton for his concluding remarks.", "John Pinkerton", "We have been way over, so why don't we just conclude the day. Thank you all very much for joining us and we look forward to hopefully similar if not better results in the second quarter. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

[Operator Instructions] Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. ", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported results for the second quarter of 2010 with record production and reduction in our unit cost in most of the major cost categories. Second quarter marks our 30th consecutive quarter of sequential record production growth. As our operations continue to become more efficient, we're able to spend capital more efficiently and realize greater returns. Range is committed to maximizing per share growth values as we grow the company.  I think you'll hear the same things reiterated from each of our speakers today. ", "On the call with me are John Pinkerton, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Ventura, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before turning the call over to John, I'd like to cover a few administrative items. ", "First, we did file our 10-Q with the SEC this morning. It is now available on the home page of our website or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today. We've also added tables, which will guide you in forecasting our future realized prices for natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids.  Detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter is also available on the website. ", "Second, we'll be participating in several conferences this August. Check out our website for a complete listing for the next several months. We'll be at Tudor, Pickering Energy Conference on August 12 in Houston, energy conference in New York on August 18 and the EnerCom 15th Annual Oil and Gas Annual Conference in Denver on August 23. ", "Now let me turn the call over to John", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Rodney. Before Roger reviews the second quarter financial results, I'll take a little time to review the key second quarter accomplishments. ", "On a year-over-year basis, second quarter production rose 9%, materially beating the high end of our guidance. If we adjusted the asset sales, first quarter production growth would have been about 13%, 14%. This marks the 30th consecutive quarter of sequential production growth as Rodney mentioned, and obviously a great milestone for our company. ", "After closing the Ohio sale, right up into March and losing roughly 25 million a day of production, our analysis indicates we would not overcome the entire Ohio loss in the second quarter. Therefore, this would stamp our record consecutive record of production growth. However, our operating teams proved the analysis wrong, and made it happen,  our growth record continues, which I'm ecstatic about. ", "It's truly a team effort with all of our divisions that are contributing. The Marcellus division was the largest contributor as they continue to drive up production by drilling outstanding wells. The 9% increase in production was more than offset by an 18% decrease in realized prices. As a result, second quarter natural gas, NGL and oil revenues were 11% lower than the prior period. ", "We are most pleased on the cost side. On a per-unit of production basis, three out of the four of our major cost categories were lower than the prior period. Direct operating cost came in at $0.68 per Mcfe, that's 21% lower than the prior year period. DD&A expense per Mcfe came in 6% lower than last year, while interest expense per unit saw a 4% decrease. ", "G&A saw a $0.07 increase over the last year. As you all know, we're still building out our Marcellus team and we'll continue to see the impact for another couple quarters or so before we begin to see a decline in a unit of production basis with regards to G&A. ", "With regard to the Marcellus Shale play, we continue to make significant headwinds during the quarter as we drill from the fantastic wells, drill on our acreage position, test other shale formations both above and below the Marcellus and continue to build out our infrastructure. ", "As we previously note, we continue to add to our a quality technical team in Pittsburgh, which now totals roughly 220 people. Right at the end of the first quarter, we completed the initial closing of our Ohio asset sale, which generated $300 million of proceeds. The sale included roughly 3,300 wells and over 13,000 leases. ", "In June, we completed the second final closing for $23 million. In total, we recorded a $79 million book gain. We placed the sales proceed in a 1031 exchange account, with the hope of deferring all or some of the tax gain. We were very fortunate to find a terrific use for a portion of the 1031 exchange account, late in the second quarter we closed on a modest property purchase, whereby we acquired Chesapeake's properties in the Nora/Haysi area of Virginia for $135,000,000. We're pretty excited about the acquisition as it -- literally fits hands in gloves with fits with our other Virginia  properties. The transaction NAV per share accretive and we see substantial upside in the properties.  Jeff will go into more detail after the specifics of the properties we acquired. ", "All in all, I couldn't be more pleased on how much we accomplished in the second quarter. It was a real testimony for the entire Range team. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob to review the financial results.", "Roger Manny", "Thanks, John. The second quarter of 2010 is setup to be a bit of a sequel to the first quarter this year. Production against all odds and asset, hit a new record high and we completed the sale of our Ohio tight sand gas properties. Also like last quarter, direct operating costs were again reduced on both in absolute and unit cost basis. ", "Natural gas, NGL and oil sales for the second quarter, including cash settled derivatives totaled $217 million, down 11% from last year, a 9% increase from falling production over last year could not overcome the 18% decline in realized prices. Now year-to-date, natural gas, NGL and oil revenue including cash settled derivatives totaled $450 million. Cash flow for the second quarter was $129 million, 17% below last year. Cash flow per share for the quarter is $0.82, $0.01 below the analyst consensus estimate of $0.83. Lower realized prices caused that $0.01 variance. Year-to-date cash flow totaled $277 million. EBITDAX for the second quarter is $156 million, 15% lower than the second quarter of last year. ", "EBITDAX for the year-to-date period was $332 million. Even though cash expenses were 6% less than the second quarter of last year, an 18% lower realized Mcfe price reduced our cash margins to $2.92 per Mcfe in the second quarter. ", "In order to better equip analysts and our investors to make estimates of our natural gas, NGL and oil price realizations as Rodney mentioned, his team has done a great job and they put three new financial guidance tables, those appears as tabs numbers six, seven and eight up there on the website under the Quarterly Supplemental Financial Tables section of our Financial Information portion of the website. So please feel free to contact Rodney or me with any questions you have about these new tables. ", "Also like the first quarter of this year, we had a few out of the ordinary revenue and expense items worthy of mention. We completed the second closing associated with the sale of our Ohio tight gas sand properties, netting a  pretax gain on sale of $10 million. Non-cash marked-to-market derivative losses for the second quarter came in at $4.4 million, and our deferred compensation plan posted non-cash income of $14.1 million, reflecting the mark-to market valuation adjustment of stock held in the plan. ", "Quarterly earnings calculated using analyst  methodology for the second quarter, and that excluded the a non-recurring items such as asset sales and unrealized derivative mark-to-market entries, that was $14.1 million or $0.09 per fully diluted share. That's $0.02 lower than the analyst consensus estimate of $0.11 a share. And like cash flow, the $0.02 variance from analyst consensus earnings was due to lower realized prices. Please reference the Range Resources website for a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, including cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and analysts earnings. ", "Although the second quarter financial performance was dragged down a bit by lower gas prices, our operating performance was again very strong. Second quarter cash direct operating expense, including the workovers were $0.68 per Mcfe. That's down $0.05 from the first quarter this year and down $0.18 or 21% from last year. Looking back two years, second quarter direct operating expense is down $0.37 from the second quarter of '08, that's a 35% reduction and it's critical cost metric over just the past two years. So it's one thing to ride the unit cost curve down as your production ramps up but in the case of direct operating costs, it's really worth noting that over the past two years, direct operating costs has not only declining on a unit cost basis, but on an absolute basis as well. And in second quarter of '08, our direct operating cost was $36.5 million on average daily production of $381 million cubic feet equivalents. ", "In the second quarter of 2010, direct operating cost is $29.1 million on average daily production of $472 million cubic feet equivalent. So even though direct operating expense is largely a production-dependent variable cost, costs are down 20% or production is up 24%. ", "Compared with our improving capital efficiency, this cost compares and illustrates the benefit of continually high grading our assets and drilling inventory, which has the added benefit of positioning Range well for the current period of low natural gas prices. ", "Looking forward to the rest of 2010, we expect direct operating cost to decline further into the low $0.60 range. Production taxes for the second quarter are flat with the second quarter last year and also flat with the first quarter of this year at $0.19 per Mcfe. ", "General and administrative expense adjusted for non-cash stock comp but including non-recurring legal expenses is $0.58 per Mcfe for the second quarter of 2010. That's up $0.07 from the second quarter of last year, and this increase stems primarily from $2.6 million in legal expenses and those were incurred to successfully defend one lawsuit and successfully settle two other legal claims. As these type of G&A expenses is difficult to predict, but the elimination of this type of uncertainty on favorable terms is always a good thing. For the rest of 2010, we anticipate G&A expense to remain steady in the second quarter as we continue to step up the Marcellus Shale division. ", "Interest expense for the second quarter of 2010 is $0.72 per Mcfe and is flat with the first quarter this year, $0.03 lower than the same quarter last year. Interest expense should remain relatively flat for the third quarter, as we deploy the remaining idle cash  proceeds from the Ohio asset sale. ", "Exploration expense for the second quarter of 2010, excluding non-cash stock comp came in at $13.4 million, that's dead even with the first quarter, $3 million higher than the second quarter of last year. The reason for this increase over last year is higher delay rental payments. Quarterly  exploration expense, excluding non-cash comp should fall in the $16 million to $18 million slot during the third quarter, as the late rentals decline, the seismic expenditures are expected to increase. ", "Depletion, depreciation and amortization per Mcfe for the second quarter of 2010 is $2.12 compared to $2.25 last year.  For all of 2009, our DD&A rate was $2.34 per Mcfe. Just as declining direct operating costs signals improving operating efficiency, declining DD&A rates signal improving capital efficiency, as we see the benefit of high grading our assets and drilling inventory. ", "Now looking forward to the remainder of 2010, we expect to see the DD&A rate continue to fall as better drilling results and better well performance manifest themselves and even lowers DD&A rates. The DD&A rate is expected to drop another $0.07 to $0.10 in the third quarter and decline towards the $2 mark by year end. Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties for the second quarter was $13.5 million, that's a $27.5 million reduction from the second quarter of '09, and while this non-cash expense fluctuates, we're beginning to see this expense normalize a bit in 2010 compared to last year. Unproved abandonment and impairment for the third quarter of this year is anticipated to be between $20 million and $22 million. That reflects lower natural gas prices and the continued shift in our capital allocation among our drilling opportunities, which of course impacts unproved property carrying values. ", "All of our $6.5 million in Federal income tax liability for the second quarter is deferred. And we continue to hold a $322 million NOL carryforward to help shield future taxable income. Our effective tax rate for the rest of the year is anticipated to be 39%, with all cash Federal tax payments deferred. ", "Investors may have noticed that we successfully deployed, as John mentioned, $139 million dollars of Ohio asset sale proceeds that we have placed in  an exchange account through the Virginia acquisition. In addition to the benefits Jeff will of speak shortly, this core area acquisition allows us to defer approximately half of the taxable gains in the Ohio asset sale, on an acquisition that's highly accretive in its own right. The remaining exchange account cash is earmarked for budgeted 2010 acreage transactions in specifically selected areas, but it is also completely unrestricted. So if the acreage is unavailable, we may move the funds out of the accounts anytime we choose. ", "For the remainder of 2010, Range has approximately 75% of its gas production hedged, with collars that are floor priced of $5.56 per Mmbtu, a cap of $7.20 per MMbtu. We've increased our 2011 hedge position. As our increased guidance reduced our percentage hedge from 51% to 48%, we have added hedges and now have 61% of our anticipated 2011 gas production hedge, with collars that are floor priced of $5.37 per MMbtu and a ceiling price of $6.54 per MMbtu. ", "In addition to adding to our 2011 hedge position, we have commenced hedging 2012 volumes with 60 million cubic feet per day of natural gas hedged with collars at $5.50 by $6.25. ", "On the oil side, we have a 1,000 barrels per day hedged in 2010. Using collars at $75 a barrel by $93.75, and we have 5,200 barrels a day hedged in 2011 with the collar of $70 by $90. Lastly, we've added 2,000 barrels of 2012 oil volume hedged at $75 by $80 in a collar.", "The balance sheet remains in great shape. Our debt-to-capital ratio, net of the cash in the 1031 is right at 40%. And we expect it to drift up a bit slightly during the remainder of the year, as we increase our spending. But we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. ", "To summarize, the second quarter of 2010 continued to demonstrate a very strong and resilient operating performance. Production loss from asset sales was fully replaced through drilling. Operating costs continue to decline on all both in absolute and unit cost basis and the DD&A rate is dropping, reflecting higher capital productivity. We believe that these are exactly the things an E&P  company should be doing in the face of low prices. ", "So we enter the second half of the year with our big 2010 asset sale done, the balance sheet in great shape, the majority of our 2010 and 2011 production favorably hedged, plus adding our first 2012 hedges. But most important all, we have a highly-focused team of employee owners that are dedicated to increasing net asset value per share and bringing it forward as prudently and rapidly as possible. ", "So John, that's it for me.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Roger. Terrific update. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff to review our operations.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Thanks, John. I'll start the operations update with the Marcellus Shale. As we get more production data from our horizontal wells, the high-quality nature of the wells is being confirmed. Our midyear estimate for all of our horizontal wells that are online averages 5 Bcfe per well. Updates of our zero time slots have been posted on our website in the current company presentation.  The five Bcfe average is based on 95 horizontal wells that all have greater than 30 days of production and they're all in the southwest part of the play. Our estimate of reserves per well per acreage has been 4 to 5 Bcfe. To date, we are clearly at the high end of that range. ", "In the southwest part of the play, given our current average lateral length of 3,050 feet with 10 frac stages, our completed well cost is about $4 million. The rate of return for our wells in Southwest Pennsylvania, which is in the wet gas area, assuming that we spent $4 million to get 5 Bcfe and that the gas price is $4 dollars per Mcf flat forever is 60%, and $5 flat forever, the rate of return at 79% and that's $6 flat and increases to 100%. I believe that this is one of the highest, if not the highest rate of return gas play in the United States. Again, the qualifiers that we are drilling in the core portion of the wet gas area of the play in the Southwest Pennsylvania. By far, Range has the dominant position in this area. ", "The buildout of the infrastructure continues on plan. We currently expect crowd capacity will be increased by MarkWest from $155 million per day today to $350 million per day by the second quarter of 2011, and then up to $390 million per day by the third quarter of 2011. Dry gas gathering and compression capacity in the southwest is planned to be increased from 20 million per day today to 65 million per day by late 2010, and then up to 100 million per day by late 2011. ", "Dry gas gathering and compression capacity in the northeast through our PVR contract is on track to come online late this year and should be 120 million per day by late 2011. In aggregate, by late 2011, we have firm plans that will give us infrastructure capacity of 610 million per day. This is well in excess of our stated target exit rate for 2011, so we're in great shape. We're currently renting 13 drilling rigs in the Marcellus play. Six of the rigs are the larger rigs, which drilled the horizontal portion of the wells with mud and the other seven rigs are smaller rigs, which drilled the vertical portion of the hole with air. The drilling team continues to get more efficient, and as a result, these rigs will draw 18 more wells in what was initially planned for 2010. Keeping all of these rigs working and drilling these 18 additional wells will result in our capital budget being increased by $31 million. ", "As a result of having drilled more wells, we plan on completing 15 of these additional 18 wells prior to year end. Some of these wells will not come online until 2011. That additional completion cost adds another $34 million to our 2010 budget. Given the strong rate of return of this project and our extensive land position, we believe that this accelerated drilling and completion is the right thing to do, even at today's gas price. We also believe that we should fast forward some of the cost of our 2011 drilling into 2010. We will pre-build some of our 2011 drilling location, roads and infrastructure in 2010. Combined, this will increase our 2010 budget by $73 million. ", "The total cost of this project is the same, but this accelerated drilling allows us to accelerate production. Finally, we will be adding $40 million to our budget in 2010 for land, with $7 million for seismic. This land will all be in the core area, where the chance of success for drilling is essentially 100%. Again, given the strong economics and low risks, we believe this is the right thing to do for our shareholders. The seismic helps to further define the 2011 drilling program. ", "One other way that we're fast forwarding our Marcellus program, is that we are combining about 14,000 net acres in Eastern Bradford County  with Talisman's  acreage there. Talisman  will operate and we'll have about a 33% working interest in this industry joint venture. Talisman has done a good job of operating here and has a dominant acreage position in this area. Combining with them will allow us to more efficiently develop this part of the play, utilizing their technical team and their drilling rigs. We're estimating that this joint venture add $25 million to our 2010 capital spending. ", "In total, we'll be adding 210 million in the Marcellus to our capital budget for 2010, all of which is for faster, more efficient development of our Marcellus acreage position. 80% of the company's 2010 budget is now targeted for the Marcellus. I want to make it clear, that even at today's gas price, the returns on the additional capital are very attractive. ", "Given the increased capital, we are revising our 2010 Marcellus exit rate from 180 million to 200 million per day net to $200 to 210 million per day net. We'll also revise on our expected 2011 Marcellus exit rates from 360 million to 400 million per day net to 400 million to 420 million per day net. We have a first-class team of 220 people located in Pennsylvania focused on this project. In addition, we now have a focused, very experienced and talented Barnett team on this project as well. Given our team, our acreage and the infrastructure we have in place or in the works, we are well positioned to meet or exceed our plans for the Marcellus. ", "We have also drilled and tested one horizontal Upper Devonian well and one horizontal Utica well in Pennsylvania. This is the first horizontal Utica well in the entire Appalachian basin and the first horizontal Upper Devonian shale well in Pennsylvania. Both wells successfully tested gas and we're encouraged by the results. However, we plan to keep the results confidential for a while due to competitive reasons. ", "Before I move on to the next topic, I want to take a few minutes and focus on our progress on the Marcellus play. Let me compare where we were one year ago with where we are today. This time last year, we were producing about 50 million per day net. Today we're producing about 160 million per day net. We have organically grown production by 110 million net over the last 12 months. A year ago during the second quarter call, I stated that our average development well in the southwest part of the play cost $3.5 million to drill and complete, and our average well based on 24 wells at that time with adequate production history was projected to recover 4.4 Bcfe. At $5 flat gas price forever, that generated a 50% rate of return. Today, our cost to drill and complete is $4 million, given we're now drilling laterals that are about 3,050 feet versus 2,500  feet last year. In addition, we're now the completing the wells with 10 stage frac versus eight a year ago. ", "Today, our average wells reserves are projected to be 5 Bcfe based on 95 horizontal wells. Spending $4 million to recover 5 Bcfe and assuming a $5 flat gas price generates a 79% rate of return versus the 50% rate of return we projected at this time last year. Not only have we driven up net production substantially, we've done it in a much more cost effective way, which results in stronger economics and a much higher rate of return. ", "Last year at this time, we estimated that our 900,000 acres on the fairway had a resource potential of 15 to 22 Tcfe net from the Marcellus. Today, we're estimating that our 900,000 acres has a resource potential of 20 to 27 Tcfe net. Importantly, given the successful drilling by Range and other companies across the play, the probability of this acreage being perspective is significantly higher today than it was at this time last year. In fact, we believe all of this acreage is highly perspective. ", "Last year, we were just talking about the upside of the Upper Devonian and Utica shales on our acreage. Today, we have successfully drilled and completed one well in each formation. ", "Finally, we have focused on our Marcellus team and Barnett team on fast forwarding this development. In addition, we're teaming up with Talisman on some of the acreage we have in  Bradford County.  All of this will result in pulling forward the net present value of this project. MarkWest is doing a great job of building out the infrastructure in the southwest, and has made great progress over the past year. ", "So at this time last year, we have not drilled in the northeast. Since then we have completed two horizontal wells in  Lycoming County for rates of 13.6 and 13.3 million per day. Last year, we have no infrastructure in place to produce these wells and develop this area. Since then, we have an agreement in place with PVR and we're well on our way to bring production online by the end of this year and the ramp-up development there next year.  ", "I am extremely pleased with the accomplishments of our team and the industry partners we're working with. Las year, I believe that we had the potential to possibly reached 2 Bcfe per day as net production in the Marcellus. Today, I believe the potential upside could reach beyond that and could possibly approach 3 Bcfe per day net. Range is in a very enviable position. I've been in the business for 31 years and have worked all over the U.S. and the world. During the last 31 years, I've only seen very few, extremely few companies who have organically grown production in the U.S. from zero in a particular play to a net rate of 2 to 3 Bcfe per day. Again, I'm talking about growing productions through drilling only and not through acquisitions. ", "ARCO's interest in Prudhoe Bay is the best example I can think of. ARCO discovered Prudhoe Bay and the peak production from the field was 1.5 million barrels per day or 9 Bcfe per day. ARCO's net production at the peak, I believe, was about 2.7 Bcfe per day. So organically, they grew to approximately 2.7 Bcfe per day. The only other example I can think of is Southwestern in the Fayetteville. They discovered the field and to date and have grown production from zero to about 1 Bcf flow per day net. And my understanding is that they expect to peak at about 2 Bcf per day net. Range discovered the Marcellus like ARCO discovered Prudhoe Bay and Southwestern discovered the Fayetteville. Range like both of those companies has the potential to grow up to 2 Bcfe per day net and perhaps beyond. That's pretty exciting stuff. ", "One other project I want to discuss today is our acquisition of additional properties in the Virginia. These properties are a great fit with our existing Nora/Haysi properties in Virginia. In fact, the portion of this acquisition directly overlaps with our  Nora/Haysi area. In Haysi,  we currently operate and have a 70% working interest in the CBM and only a royalty on the rest of the formations, which are the tight gas sands and the Huron  Shale. This acquisition will give us a 100% working interest and 100% net revenue interest on all of the Haysi plays. ", "As good as the Nora CBM has been economically, the tight gas sands were even better. We've included a new graph on our website that shows the rate of return of the Nora tight gas sands versus the CBM. For a $5 flat NYMEX forever, the rate of return for a tight gas sands well is 40% and for $6 flat forever, it increases to 56%. That's for an average Nora well, which is drilled on 112 acres spacing and averages about 450 million cubic feet of gas per well. The Haysi wells that we're acquiring is even better than the Nora wells. The Haysi wells averaged about 550 million per day and are drilled on an average spacing at 224 acres to date. ", "There are clearly a lot of very low-risk drilling opportunities with great economics in this area, and we have a very talented and accomplished team, who can efficiently and effectively developed the property and we're pleased to have the opportunity to add to our holdings here . ", "In addition to the Haysi properties, this block of acreage extends to the north northeast. All told, it's about 115,000 acres, and we believe that this acreage contains the resource potential of approximately 800 BCF net. In essence, the acreage is surrounded by production in all directions and is in the center of a very large gas accumulation. The acreage that we acquire is prospective for all horizons including the Huron Shale, which is only had very limited vertical development here. In the other traditional horizons, the well was drilled on about double the spacing of the surrounding fields. We believe that there's a lot of low-risk, strong economic wells to drill. ", "In addition to the acquisition capital, we'll be spending about $5 million on these properties in the second half of 2010. We have included in our updated company presentation a map showing the new acreage in the surrounding wells. At Range, our strategy is  to grow production with one of the best all-in cost structures in the business and to build and high grade our inventory. In addition to adding high-quality plays like the Marcellus, Nora and the Barnett to our portfolio. We have sold out of the Gulf of Mexico, Ohio, New York, Fuhrman-Mascho and other fields. The net result is shown on our website in our latest IR presentation. ", "Since 2007, we have decreased our well count by 50%, while increasing our production by 52%. Bottom line, we're a much more efficient company. The combination of adding higher-quality plays and focusing our people and capital there, while selling relatively high-cost, low-growth areas has led to better production and reserve replacement, lower F&D,  lower LOE and better rates of return. This, in addition to our resource potential, which is 10x our current reserve base, coupled with one of the best teams in the business, will lead to an exciting future for Range. ", "Back to you, John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Jeff. Terrific update. Before we look to the remainder of 2010, I'll spend a few minutes in summarizing of what we we've accomplished so far in the first half of the year. ", "As we discussed production in the first half exceeded expectations, due to better-than-expected drilling results, and due to these results and the small Virginia acquisition, we're increasing our production guidance for the year from 12% to 14% and this does include the impact of the asset sales. On the cost side, we continue to drive down our unit cost, in particular the reduction in direct operating cost and DD&A are particularly encouraging. The good news is that these are not onetime events. We expect the unit cost to continue and decline in the quarters ahead. ", "Another significant accomplishment was completing the Ohio sale earlier in the year, when gas prices were higher and by completing the initial closing in the first quarter, where we're able to lock down our drilling plans for the year. ", "Next, the Virginia acquisition we completed in June couldn't have come along at a better time, and we're excited about the potential of the properties as Jeff has mentioned. Acquiring the properties at good prices and using the 1031 account proceeds were the home run. As I've said many times, I love the Nora area. It is our Energizer bunny and that it keeps on going and going and gets better and better. ", "The most significant achievement in the first half of 2010 is clearly the progress we continue to make in the Marcellus Shale play. As Jeff mentioned, our well performance continues to improve, our returns continue to improve. The infrastructure buildout was right on track, the quality and depth of the field service partners continues to improve, and the regulatory environment is becoming more predictable. While we haven't said much about the other formations due to competitive reasons, we made progress identifying and quantifying the potential of the other formations and are extremely excited about their potential. Bottom line is, that we are even more convinced today versus at the beginning of the year, that we have found a giant gas field that generates very attractive returns, at very low natural gas prices. Importantly, we have accumulated an extremely large, attractively-located acreage position in the play. Every month, more and more of our acreage is being derisk and we really like what we see. ", "Lastly, given that most of our capital spending in 2010 is focused in the Marcellus Shale play. The results there will drive our production reserve results for the year. Due to the excellent drilling in the first half of the year and the Virginia acquisition as I noted before, we've increased our production guidance. With regard to reserves, we currently believe we are on track to record an all-in find development cost of less than $1 per Mcfe for 2010. This will be the first time in our history to go below $1. ", "This is key, as it clearly indicates the quality of the Marcellus and its superior economics. Looking through the remainder of 2010, we see continued strong operating results. For the third quarter, we're looking for production to average $495 million to $500 million a day, representing a 14% increase year-over-year. Our third quarter production, where we'll reflect the sale of both the New York properties we sold last December, and the New York properties we sold at March of this year. So the 14% third quarter target equates to 19% after adjusting for the asset sales. Now that we closed the Ohio property sale, I'll take a moment to look at the impact of our divestiture program. ", "Over the past few years, we've reduced our well count by roughly 6,000 wells. As Jeff mentioned, this represents 50% of our well count, but they only represent approximately 9% of our production reserves. The properties we sold were more mature, higher cost properties. The good news is that while we were selling our more mature higher cost properties, we refocused on our capital in our higher return properties like the Marcellus, the Nora area and the Barnett Shale. As a result, despite the assets sales, the production reserves continues to increase rapidly. ", "Over the same three-year period, we've seen our well count declined, our production is driven by over 50%. As a result, Range is a much more efficient company, we like to say we're doing more with less. By less we mean less wells, low refining development cost, lower operating cost and lower year end cost per Mcf. We believe this is critical in a low-cost environment. ", "Turning to the topic of joint ventures. We were often asked about the various joint ventures that are either coming through or completed and what our current thoughts are. We prefer not to complicate our operations, in the way we do business. We continue to have discussions internally and with third-parties regarding joint ventures. I think it's important to differentiate between the industry joint ventures versus what we call the large financial joint ventures. Industry joint ventures or JVs where two companies in the industry pooled their acreage primarily for efficiency reasons and to jointly share the risk of developing the combined acreage position. Financial JVs, where one company contributes to land and the second company contribute to help defer the cost of development. So far nearly all the joint ventures associated with the shale plays have been the large financial joint ventures. ", "Due to our drilling results and other industry wells, a substantial portion of our acreage has been derisked in the Marcellus. Because of the reduced risk of our acreage, we can reasonably model our acreage and from a NAV per share basis. Bottom line, if we received an offer that is NAV accretive, we'll seriously pursue it. As Jeff mentioned, we believe that our Marcellus acreage could result in production one day, and potentially 2 or 3 BCF per day. Assuming we entered into a large financial joint venture, where we gave up a third of our acreage, we would be given up a third of the production or roughly 700 million to nearly 1 BCF per day. While I want to make clear this is a very simplified analysis, one can readily see that we should be extremely careful in considering the NAV per share impact of any large financial JV. That being said, at Range, we focused on NAV per share. I believe we've demonstrated this over the years in a very disciplined way. ", "I'll now take a moment to discuss the regulatory environment in the Marcellus play. While challenging, the regulatory environment has improved in many ways over the past three years. First, the drilling permit process in Pennsylvania has gotten much more predictable, and we're regularly receiving permits in 30 days or less. Second, the water access and flow back process is much more predictable, especially given that Range is recycling 100% of its flowback water in the southwest portion of the play. The Pennsylvania DEP is very supportive of our recycling program. It's not only a better environmental solution, but it also saves us money. ", "With regard to the severance tax in Pennsylvania, the good news is the state has not yet enacted the tax. In the past the past several years, we and the rest of the industry have worked hard to educate and worked with the Pennsylvania legislature about issues surrounding the severance tax, encouraging them to take a holistic approach, whereby, any severance tax would come with a balance regulatory modernization.", "Recently, the Pennsylvania legislation announced that it would work for the severance tax proposal causing for enactment on or before October 1, 2010, and effective January 1, 2011. We are continuing to closely monitor the situation and believe a holistic balanced approach will likely result. ", "There's also been much discussion pro and con about hydraulic fracturing. As we discussed this issue with many people in Pennsylvania, the clear message we received was that there was a great desire to know more about the makeup of our frac-ing fluid. As a result, we have spent several months working with our service partners that we could disclose the content of our frac-ing fluid. On July 14, we announced a voluntary disclosure initiative regarding the Marcellus Shale frac-ing fluid. We announced that we'll submit to the Pennsylvania DEP additional information about the content of the fluid on a well-by-well basis and also posted information on the website. ", "We also announced that the current frac fluid moisture contains 99.86% water and sand, with the remaining 0.014% being chemical additives. Of the additives, 0.004% are considered hazardous in a concentrated form, according to the Federal Regulatory Classification, and like most common household chemical substances, in a diluted form, post no harm. Our objective with this initiative is to continue at Range this philosophy of transparency and to provide all the citizens of Pennsylvania an accurate record of our frac fluid content and put their concerns at ease.  ", "Our recent survey data indicates that a great majority of the citizens of Pennsylvania support Marcellus drilling. We felt that our voluntary disclosure initiative was simply the right thing to do. We have received very positive feedback from nearly everyone regarding our initiative, including regulatory environmental legislators, land owners and other Marcellus operators and the general public as a whole. We are hopeful that other Marcellus operators will follow through, but we understand it will take them a while to work through the disclosure issues with their service companies. ", "We are actually convinced that the Marcellus can be developed in a way that it's safe and environmentally sensitive for the benefit of everybody. We don't believe it's an either/or situation. By developing low-cost, clean burning natural gas in a safe and environmentally sensitive way, everybody wins. In the weeks and months ahead, we will be coming out with initiatives towards better educating Pennsylvanians about how we go about developing natural gas on the Marcellus in a safe and environmentally sensitive way. We have been working on this broader initiative for some time and look forward to rolling it out. ", "With it, we would be taking a proactive position, with the goal of beginning to dispel many of the non-taxable statements that others have made. Our number one goal is to simply educate. We believe that the Marcellus Shale play and natural gas is a great opportunity, and once more and more people understand and better understand the issues, they will embrace the safe and environmentally sensitive development. ", "Finally, I'll take a few minutes to discuss capital expenditures and funding. As Jeff discussed, Range is in an admirable position as we believe we can now grow the Marcellus production from 116 million a day, net, where we are today to 2 or 3 Bcf net over the next several years strictly through the drill bit, I may add. To add to what Jeff said, we believe we can do this at a fine development cost of $1 per Mcf or less. This is extremely good news for Range and its shareholders. ", "Because Range is not a major oil company or an extremely large independent, we were able to accomplish this high growth at extremely low cost. The impact on our NAV per share will be extraordinary. The challenge is how do we capture as much of the NAV impact for Range's shareholders? We firmly believe that if we stick to our disciplined approach, by focusing on NAV per share, we will put ourselves in the best position to drive up our NAV in the medium to long term. ", "Instead of trying to douse you with some of the new financial maneuvering, I'll first review what our past track record had been. Over the past two and a half years, I think since the end of 2007, we have expended $4.6 billion of capital. 51% of funding has come through operating cash flow, 19% from asset sales, 18% from the issuance of debt and 13% from the issuance of equity. Since 2007, we have increased the shares outstanding by 7% in total or about 2.8% per year on average. ", "Looking forward, we plan to take the same approach. That being said, developing a giant gas field in a low-price environment will be challenging. However, we have several advantages going for us. First, the Marcellus Shale, and especially the liquid-rich portion of the Marcellus, is extremely economic even at low gas prices. Our analysis indicates that $2.50 flat NYMEX gas and $60 flat oil or liquid ridge area in Southwest PA generates a 35% rate of return. So it makes sense for us to aggressively develop our Southwest PA acreage position in the current gas price environment as we'll be generating attractive returns, increasing NAV per share and fast forwarding the net present value. The increase of the 2010 capital budget is a reflection of this. Funding the increase will come from a combination of additional asset sales and draws under our credit facility. ", "The second advantage is that the Marcellus Shale is uniquely located in the best gas market in the world. Therefore, Marcellus ore [ph] gas will have a location premium over other large gas plays in the U.S., Canada and throughout the world. Third, there's a significant and existing large pipeline infrastructure already in place to move Marcellus gas to market. While there'll be investment necessary to interconnect the large existing pipeline systems to the Marcellus gathering systems, the investment will be far less than the other major new gas plays. ", "Fourth, Range has a significant amount of other production that it can sell from time to time to help fund the Marcellus. Fifth, Range has a strong balance sheet and nearly $1 billion of liquidity to help fund our growth. Sixth, Range has an attractive hedge positions for 2010 and 2011 that will help underpin our cash flow. Most importantly, because the Marcellus is so economically attractive, over time, it will become self-funding. The self-funding point will depend on a number of factors, including natural gas prices, the pace of development and the cost to develop. ", "With understand the concerns of shareholders who worry about dilution through the issuance of equity. We are right with you there as all of us at Range have a great majority of our net worth in Range stock. However, I'd be misleading you if I didn't expect that all of us would suffer some dilution in the future. However, I will commit to you that we would do the best and minimize the NAV dilution from where we are to reach the point of self-funding. ", "These are extremely exciting times at Range. We have a great team of people at Range, highly motivated to bringing forward our NAV per share as quickly as prudently possible. The second quarter results are reflection of our passion and our ability to succeed. We truly appreciate our shareholders' continued support. The future is extremely bright at Range. With that, operator, let's turn the call open for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Gentlemen, our first question is from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company", "Real quickly, just following up on your last statements there, John, with the increase in CapEx for 2010 and a lot of that tail end with the year CapEx flowing through the production in 2011, can you talk a little bit about maybe what we should be thinking about for CapEx in 2011, flat versus up substantially from 2010? And then as you mentioned, kind of a pass to free cash flow neutral, had that pushed this out in any way, shape or form at this point?", "John Pinkerton", "We're just in the throws of putting together our 2011 analysis, and we're going to share that to the board in September, and then what we normally do is, based on our comments, finalize that in December. So that's what we'll do again this year. I think it's too early to tell in terms of where we're going to be. Obviously, we'll be sensitive to where natural gas prices are. Historically, it's been a pretty easy playbook and that we've taken cash flow and asset sales to fund the bulk of our capital. And then we try to use debt and equity securities at the high end, at the end of it, and then obviously, the equity side is the very end of it. And we'll continue to do that. So it's just a little bit too early to look at 2011 in my mind. But again, the good news is that we're really driving down the cost per unit, so we'd be able to do more with less. The other thing, I think, is really, really important is if you kind of step back and look at this from a kind of NAV per share perspective, and we're running models all the time to try to figure out what's the best way to drive up our NAV per share. And that's really what we're all focused about. And we've run a ton of models on the $210 million that we're going to spend this year, and we're actually convinced it's the right thing to do, and we'll do the same thing for next year's capital budget. That being said, we're going to tee up some more asset sales for this year. John and his team are already worked at that, so we'll try to look at that. And obviously, asset sales for 2011 will be a big part of the plan as well. So that's kind of where we stand.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company", "John, following up on that, you mentioned as part of the sales in your prepared speech the possibility of selling production. Did you mean that outright in terms of doing maybe a volumetric production payment to be able to accelerate cash from that to then reinvest in accelerating the NAV out of the Marcellus, or am I reading too much into that comment?", "John Pinkerton", "Well, I think the asset sales are being more along the lines of what we've historically done. One of the rules at Range is because they try to keep it simple, and production payments, at least in our view, are highly complicated. They really trash up your balance sheet, and it creates a lot of legal documents that you have, like the lawyers running around and review all the time, so that those aren't things we think are productive in the long-term trying to run a business. So we're going to stay away from production payments for the most part. We've got, I don't know what the total number is, but roughly 130 million, 150 million a day of production that's not from our big three. And we'll continue to take a look at that and high-grade that and look at the more marginal higher costs up. Just like what we have in the past, we'll continue to sell that stuff off and help generate proceeds. So I don't think there's going to be anything fancy that we're going to come out with. Like I said, we're not going to try to douse you with some kind of new,  financial trick of the trade here. We're going to stick to our knitting, we're going to stick to what we've historically done. And again, I think there's a lot of different ways to spending the cash. If you look how Southwestern did what they did, have done, we obviously studied that quite hard and some other things. So we'll continue to look at things, and at the end of the day, again, the one thing that you can, I'll put the stake in the ground, so to speak, is whatever we do, we'll look at all the alternatives, and we'll pick the one that generates the highest NAV per share. So whatever it comes down to, that'll be the stake in the ground.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company", "Looking at the uptick in 2011 Marcellus gas production, can you guys give us a little bit more of a breakdown in terms of southwestern production, northeastern production, is that larger number just being driven purely by the efficiencies or should we expect maybe the Northeastern gas to be coming on sooner? And then as a follow-up to that, just I know you guys are in the process of putting a propane line in place, so obviously, NGLs across that whole area would increase production like yours is going higher, where are we on that propane line and is it on schedule, et cetera, et cetera?", "John Pinkerton", "So let me talk about the production a little bit. We're not going to -- the bulk of that is going to be coming from the Southwest. That's the de-risk area. We're really building out a lot of infrastructure. What we got, the liquid ridge part of it, so all of that is going to be where the bulk of our drilling and bulk of production is. However, by the end of this year, we expect we will get production on from the Northeast, so that will start to contribute. But if you look at our acreage, 900,000 acres that allows us to grow significantly from where we are on the order of 8x over just from the Marcellus, the bulk of that acre, 600,000 of that is in the Southwest, and there's been a lot of industry drilling, a lot of our drilling, I'd say 90-plus percent of that acreage has been de-risked. So that's where you're going to see the bulk of our activity. In terms of the propane line, I mean, it's moving along as we thought, and we're pleased with -- there's some regulatory stuff they got to get through, but it's making great progress. And so we're right on scale in that, right on schedule.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company", "Just a clarification, like, most of the production coming from the Southwest liquids ridge propane line, feels like it'll be done in time to ensure that there aren't any liquid-related issues there. Just trying to kind of check that box, more than anything else.", "John Pinkerton", "Yes, I mean, let me back up a little bit. The propane line, we're already doing propane down the pipeline even though the big line we're talking about is a longer-term issue that really deals with the ethane. And as we ramp up in the Southwest, we'll ramp up the ethanes. Currently, we're just selling the ethane in the back stream. We put just a little [ph] amount that selling of ethane because we get paid more. So that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to capture the whole gas stream there. The good news is that we dominate the liquid-richer, so a lot of this progress is going through us, and we're seeing a lot of different things. And the good news is that there's a lot of neat, creative things going out there, and so we're encouraged by that, and if you think over time, it'll continue to help the margins and whatnot.", "Operator", "And Marshall Carver with Capital One Southcoast.", "Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.", "The new bolt-on acreage at Nora/Haysi, I know you helped the mineral interest on the old acreage. What's the royalty on that new acreage?", "Roger Manny", "1/8.", "Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.", "And on the production mix for next quarter, could you give us a feel for what, either in absolute numbers or percentages, what the split would be between oil, NGLs and gas?", "Roger Manny", "What I'd suggest there is after the call, I mean, Rodney is trying to put out a lot more information on that split in mix, and so people can get pricing right. It's probably better, I would say, to just call Rodney. He can give you some of that detail.", "Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.", "And then finally, a question on the Huron and Devonian wells. It looks like you're encouraged with the initial results. Trying to think long term, it seems like it would have trouble competing with the Marcellus in terms of economics unless it's really good because the Marcellus is so good. So how would it be able to get capital or would you potentially sell that or JV it? What would your plan be on success here on Devonian Shales?", "John Pinkerton", "Let me clarify that, and so that it's really clear. The Huron potential is down in Virginia. That's on our existing Nora acreage, Haysi acreage and the new acquisition acreage. The Huron is a Devonian age shale. When we go up to Southwest Pennsylvania, and we're saying Upper Devonian, it's not Huron. It's Genesee briquette lines, Great Middlesex, it's an aggregate of those shales. And it's literally in Southwest Pennsylvania right on top of the Marcellus. And I wish I could actually, with a lobbing heart, to be able to talk about it in more detail because we have a lot of data and a lot of exciting data, but I can tell you, I'll say this, after drilling our first well, we're clearly ahead of where we were in the Marcellus at the same point in time. As we drill every Marcellus well, you're drilling right through that Upper Devonian package. We've now drilled and completed our first well. We have long-term testing on it. It'll be online later this year. We've actually drilled our second well and we will be completing probably by the end of September, and we'll have a third well. It's right on top of the Marcellus, so it's really going to help us with efficiencies. All those its lines and compression and gathering and everything, so literally like the same area. The acreage is -- there's no acreage cost; it's right on top of where we are. That has a huge potential, I mean the potential, when you look at Bcf per mile off of Bcf logs, what's in the Upper Devonian aggregate is on par with what we have in the Marcellus. So it's extremely high upside. So it's not -- it has fantastic potential. That was a very general answer, and hopefully, whether it's the next quarter or the following quarter, we can get more specific. But so far, I just say we're encouraged. And well, for total clarification, we have Huron down in Virginia, and the whole of that acreage is perspective for the Huron. You have Upper Devonian basically in Southwest Pennsylvania, and then there's a third upside in the Utica Shale, which is below the Marcellus. And again, we've drilled and completed our first unit of well, have long-term testing. We will be spreading another well probably early in the first quarter of next year. And there's tremendous upside in the Utica as well, so you have three horizons.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "Jeff, on the 2 to 3 Bcf per day that you think you can now get to, at what point down the road do you think you can achieve that level? Is that five years from now or three years or even longer?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, let me start with where we've been historically, and then I'll, in big ways, talk about going forward, and hopefully, give you some guidance. If you go to the end of 2008, I believe we were about 26 million per day, net, onto the Marcellus. At the end of 2009, we tripled it or we actually quadrupled it to 100 million per day, net. The end of this year, basically, we'll double it, 200 million to 210 million. And we're giving guidance for end of 2011 to double that again till we get to 400 to 420 million per day, net. That's the kind of trajectory that you'll see. If you look in our current book or current presentation out on our website, on Slide 13, I believe -- it's Rodney giving me the right information, you can see the Range hockey stick. You can take that, and you can get a French curve, which is what you'll need because it is exponential up. And you can project forward with where you think we'll be at the end of 2011. Once we go through that budgeting process that John talked and present to the board and walk down on where we'll be, I would imagine, sometime around the end of this year, we'll probably come out and ping out that euphoria. And I believe it's pretty exciting. I mean, again, you can look at the hockey stick, see where it has been, where it was going, and as we ping out that extra year, then I think you get a pretty clear feeling. And you can probably do it yourself with the data that's out there on when you think we'll break that. So that's exciting. I mean, a lot of people, I think, just to a little more color, and I tried to do it in my notes, and I know you guys go through a lot of presentations and a lot of conferences and everybody's talking about Bcf, but how many of those really materialize? How many companies have done organically and have been able to literally grow from 2 Bcf per day or two or beyond, and that's I can think of two, and since I've been in the business for 31 years. Range clearly is on that trajectory, and we have the potential to get into that slot and do it organically and to do it with an extremely low-cost structure, really strong economics. And that's really what's going to drive NAV, and like John said, that's what we're focused on.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "On the ethane production, it sounds like you're still keeping that in the gas stream for now. What will be the trigger point that gets you to start to strip that out, begin to sell it, especially given the current price situation for ethane?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, I think you got to remember, we always have a couple of options. I mean, one option is to continue to do what we're doing and to blend. And right now, we're getting paid for the Btus, and even after we strip out the liquids, which are really nice positive boost to our rate of return, we still get paid for the Btus. So after processing, we still have 1,140 Btu gas roughly. So we have the ability to keep blending, but like John said, since we have a dominant position there, a lot of those projects were critical piece, turning those projects going forward. And we look at them all to see what's optimum. Is it better to continue to blend long term, or is it better to break it out? And again, like John said, all this is going to be based on what maximizes NAV per range.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "And Roger, just a couple questions. On the G&A, you talked about you expect it to be flat with the second quarter. Is that flat after backing out the $2.5 million legal fee, or is it going to continue to grow at kind of that level just because the increased staffing year you're undergoing up in Pennsylvania?", "Roger Manny", "I think it'll be in that $0.57 ,$0.58 slot for the remainder of the year on. We're continuing to add staff and gear up the capital increase. You need more people, but again, like Jeff said, a lot of these expenditures are really -- their project expenditures were just moving from '11 to '10, so got to get extra people to handle that. So it's a little bit of a fast-forward and broad, too. So it's the eight-ish.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "And then finally on liquidity, can you walk through which is current liquidity is in terms of cash and under your revolver?", "Roger Manny", "Yes, sure. Our borrowing base is currently $1.5 billion on our bank credit facility. That was just reaffirmed in March of this year, and our next bank meeting is in September. All indications are what kind of reserve performance we're seeing there is that our maximum conforming capacity will be above that $1.5 billion number by a considerable margin, but we don't have a need to access that. Our legal and binding commitment, Ron, is $1,250,000,000. And the way our facility works is we can send a notice with the agent and then we can increase from that $1,250,000,000 to $1,500,000,000 with 20 days notice among existing groups. So just see enough the $1,250,000,000, we've got $475 million outstanding, but that's a little misleading because we've got $160 million parked in that escrow. So you're looking at a net bank debt in the low $300 million against $1,250,000,000 in committed availability. So we're just under $1 billion in liquidity on a legally binding basis, and about $1,250,000,000 on a maximum volume base.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Gil Yang with Bank of America.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Granted you accelerate your activity, as you increase more NAV per share, I just want to get inside your head a little bit and think about what limits the ability to accelerate even more if you think that you can create NAV through this acceleration?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, I think when you look at it, a big driver was when we entered the year or at the end of last year when we set our budget, we went through the same process last September, October, November, December. We commenced with the number of wells we think, the rigs we have under contract of drill, and the reality is our technical organization with those same number of rigs can now drill more wells. That was a key part. So as we've gone up the learning curves, we really had two choices there. One is we could format a rig. But given the strong economics and strong rates of return, and again, look at where we were last year, rate of return under a fixed price than where we are this year, significantly better. It was great last year; it's even better this year. So our decision was rather than to format a rig, that's what prompts those points to the extent our team gets faster and faster with the same number of rigs. That's been accelerate production. And again, that acceleration, some people are looking at what did it do to this year, what does it do to next year, and we raised guidance both years. But I think actually, the question, and I think Ron asked it, where does it take you, where are you going to be out there in terms of breaking the Bcf per day. That acceleration helps you in 2012 and beyond because as you build those into an area, when you build a pan off of it, well, then you can combine and can build additional pans off the same road. You can drill additional wells off the same acreage. There is additional wells off the same path. So those efficiencies are what is going to drive of this. We're not about running the most number of rigs or like John said, many times being the biggest and baddest and running the most number of rigs in the play, we're about rate of return and NAV, and we let our technical team sort of dictate that. And we learn as we go. The good news is as the more we drill, the more the acreage gets de-risked. The more the industry drills, the more the acreage gets de-risked. So that 20-plus Bcf that we see at there right now is looking extremely strong. The production growth is looking great. The rates of return are better, and you're seeing it quarter-to-quarter, and our unit cost, they are coming down, as Roger's mentioned. So that's what drives our decisions.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So the increase in spending for the roads and the pads, et cetera for next that you're accelerating into 2010, again, a result of the more efficient drilling rigs that you've seen?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, well, it's a combination of that, but also, as we're starting to develop in the Northeast, we're getting more efficient organization. In the Southwest, you're out in front of the mountains. When you go into the Northeast, you're up in the mountain, so you have winter in Pennsylvania. It's important in both areas, but pre-building some of that stuff in the fall and before wintertime, again, makes this more efficient. It's more cost-effective, it's a better thing to do. And as we ramp up in that area, we're pulling some of that fast forward because I talked about those two rates for our first two horizontals in Lycoming County being 13.5 million per day roughly each. Those are seven-day averages. So those are pretty impressive rates, and those are pretty strong wells when we finish. That's a heck of a shale well, so we're excited about that. We're up there drilling right now, and we want to bring that stuff online. So it's all part of how do we maximize the value of our share price, how do we maximize NAV. And those are the things that drive us.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "When you already have had capital in your budget for the Northeast expansion in terms of the accelerating, in getting out in front of a wintertime?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, we had capital. We have some capital in there, but it comes back to -- you remember, a lot of that capital, most of the capital predominantly is for the Southwest. That's for most of our infrastructure and most of our drilling is. But as you have the capital in there, we did our deal with PVR. PVR looks like they're on track. It looks it won't be delayed. It looks like it'll be, if anything, maybe a little earlier, so we want to pull some of that a little bit forward to make sure -- if we can get it on this year, we think that just continue with the great story that we have.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "For the Talisman joint venture, of the $25 million, just like you said, how much is the total commitment to hold that acreage for that joint venture?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, it's really about developing acreage that we think is prospective. In that plan to develop the acreage or to maximize value of the acreage will not only drive our production but will hold the acreage. That capital does, in essence, both. It's not one or the other, it's both.", "John Pinkerton", "There's no quote. We haven't committed $100 million or $200 million or $300 million. It's just the normal operating agreement and when Talisman or Nashville [ph] sit down and decide how to drill wells and then either party can either commit or not commit to those wells, and you could -- see you have a little lever there where you want to commit capital or not. So it's not like -- it's much different in the JV, these financial JVs. This is a regular industry joint venture where you've got two industry partners, just developing an acreage position. And again, I think one of the things that's encouraging to me is that, that acreage up 14,000, 15,000 acres would not have been developed in the short term for us. So what we're doing is we're pulling that forward, that acreage forward in our NAV curve, and we're using the benefit, our Talisman technical team in their rigs and people to help us develop that. And I think it's pretty smart on our part to do that. What we have to give up is the day-to-day operations, which a lot of companies don't like to do, but obviously, Talisman's a first-class organization. As Jeff said, they drill from terrific wells up there. So we feel really comfortable with them. Not they will do a lot of these, but we're talking to different people about some of the stuff and other prices where we have bits and pieces of acreage that we're not going to get to in the short-term. It's a great solution to deal with that NAV issue in terms of pulling that forward into the NAV curve. So again, it's part of it. As Jeff mentioned, now when we have Talisman's team now working on that is that we brought Mark Whitley and his team from the Barnett Shale, and they're going to be working a lot on this Northeast acreage. So this time last year, we had one team working on it, now we'll have three teams working on it. We just think that makes sense in terms of bringing -- you're getting of them with three teams, and you only have one team. So again, it's pretty -- it's just the maturation of the process. You kind of learn as you go.", "Operator", "We will go to David Heikkinen of Tudor, Pickering, Holt for our final question.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering & Co. Securities, Inc.", "As I think about the acceleration of CapEx from 2010 into 2011, I'm thinking about that as a recurring talk that all these years, you pre-invest in roads and pads and the like. Is that a reasonable expectation or would CapEx actually drop in 2011 versus 2010?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "So I think a better way to think about it is the total project CapEx is the same. We're just pulling it forward. It's as simple as that.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering & Co. Securities, Inc.", "And you'll pull forward 2012 into 2011. I mean, it's kind of acceleration. That train target keeps going for roads and pads and the like.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Right, but you're pulling forward and increasing the rate of production, and the NPV of the project is greater. But the capital, the overall capital is the same. You're just moving it all forward, but you're moving the production and the reserves and everything else forward as well.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering & Co. Securities, Inc.", "And then just specifically on split of rigs running on the liquid ridge versus dry gas in the Southwest, do you have that?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, right now, we just have one rig in the Northeast. All the other rigs are in the Southwest, and they're all in the wet gas.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering & Co. Securities, Inc.", "And then speaking about the Nora transaction, I know it's relatively small dollars and kind of a core area for range, but trying to think about how investing capital and blocking that up adds more NAV than investing more and just developing your huge Marcellus solution?", "John Pinkerton", "Well, I think it's -- again, I think we believe what our mission is to build NAV per share. And we've got some core areas in the Barnett and then Nora and the Marcellus, and we're going to continue to build on those. We think it makes sense when you look at the overall risk of the industry, and we've done a lot of studying. At the end of the day, do we want to be a one-basin company? And I think the answer to that is no, we don't. And so when we see opportunities in these other areas, we think it's prudent from a risk prospective to go ahead and seize that opportunity. Like I said before, we haven't done an acquisition for, I think, way back into 2007, and then that was we had a little piece of Nora. I think going back to that, I think it was back in 2006, 2005. So we've been really disciplined on the acquisition side and not do anything because we've had this Marcellus opportunity. But we've had these opportunities in Nora, and we think they're exceptional. So we're going to go ahead and do it. And again, I think you got to look at the risk, the overall risk in the industry, in our company and just think through it. Do you want to put all your eggs in one basket? And we're obviously putting all our eggs in the Marcellus basket, but we think it's prudent to -- in an area like Nora, what we know so much about, we got a great team. I think Jeff mentioned we think the upside on those reserves is the 100-plus Bcf approved. We think that total reserve that size is close to 800 Bcf. So great, great long NAV-accretive acquisition. Do I think we're going to do a lot of those? No, and I think history shown over the last several years, we haven't done one. It's relatively small, and it's a perfect fit. So we think it made real good sense. And look, I think if you're going to be buying something today, I know a lot of people are rushing out to buy oil projects, but I got to tell you this, if I was an acquirer today, I'd be buying gas prop because I think there's substantial, more upside in gas prices than there are in oil prices. So again, that's a little bit of this jumping [ph] editorial in terms of the acquisition market, but we're not going to be a big player in the acquisition market. I don't think any shareholder should worry that we're going to run around doing some giant acquisition anytime soon. I think that you make a good point. We're going to stick to our knitting. We've got our sandboxes. We've got our terrific and we're going to continue to expand those. But again, from time to time, where we see little bolt-on or add-ons in these key areas, we're going to continue to try to take advantage of that. That's what we think that long term, that's what our shareholders want from us.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Pinkerton for his closing remarks.", "John Pinkerton", "Well, thank you, all. Second quarter was, it's really a terrific quarter for us, being able to continue our consecutive string of quarterly production increases. Obviously, given the guidance we gave you, we expect to hit 31, and then at the end of the year, hit 32. That would be eight consecutive years of sequential production growth. I think and more importantly, and obviously, nobody knows peers, which may be able to do that, something we're very proud. But I think importantly is just a focus on what's really happening within range, and that is we decreased our operating costs by more than a third. As Roger mentioned, we're actually running now on an absolute basis. Last time we were, when production was almost a quarter lower. The other thing I think is really important is we're driving down our DD&A rate, which is really at the end of the day, that's what has to happen in a low-price environment. And we've tried to be a $2, maybe with a little luck, we'll be under $2 by the end of the year to continue to drive that down. And that's going to do a lot of stuff. And at year-end, if we do book reserves, added over -- with less than $1 all-in signing cost, that's going to continue to drive down our DD&A rate. That'll increase our net earnings. That'll increase our shareholders' equity. It'll allow us to continue to prudently put on leverage on the company. As Roger said, we're going to keep a firm balance sheet, but as we drive down our cost, our debt per Mcfe, approved Mcfe, is going to drop pretty significantly this year with the additions that we're going to put on. That will allow us to continue to accelerate production and capital into these projects. And like I said, too, I'm not going to fool you and say we're never going to issue any equity ever again and suffering dilution. But at the end of the day, the worst dilution in my mind would be go out and do giant joint venture where you give up a quarter, a third of your acreage position. That is the ultimate in dilution. So again, when you run the model, we're going to be very sensitive that we're focused on the medium- to long-term, and the good news is we found a giant gas field, it's working. It's working like spades, and it can work terrific to 350 to 450 gas, and we're convinced through that, we're going to charge ahead and develop NAV per share and try to fast-forward those, as prudently possible as we can. And again, we appreciate everybody's support. I know the current gas environment is unsettling for many investors. I think the cure for low gas prices is low gas prices. The good news is we're able to keep gas price at $4.50 to $5 range. Most of record generation in the U.S. in the future will be with natural gas. It's cleaner for the environment, so we're going to be doing some good for the environment as well. So I think it's all good. We'll get through this period of low natural gas prices, and demand will pick up one of these days, and gas prices will increase. It's going to happen. Gas prices will not stay low forever. There's just too much energy in man. All will, will for that to happen. And it's cleaner, and we can do the current technologies. We don't have to shed a light to some cleaner version of it. So the future is bright. We'll get to this period of low gas prices, and I think towards the end of the year, as you all see, with more vigor, what the signing costs are going to be, where the production is going, as Jeff mentioned, the hockey stick, in terms of Marcellus, is really exciting. We'll give you some date in terms of the other formations. That's terrific work. We just need to add in some of our acreage positions before we do that, and that's occurring. So it's all good, and we're excited. And again, for those of you all who didn't get to ask questions, feel free to call us. We'll be here all day. We're not leaving, and we're taking in all questions from everybody and try to be as transparent as we can.

Before Roger reviews the third quarter financial results, I'd like to take just a few minutes to review the key accomplishments in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, third quarter production rose 15% beating the high end of our guidance. This marks the 31st consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. In addition we reached, as Rodney mentioned, the 500 million per day production milestone for the first time in our company's history. Kudos goes out to our operating teams on that.", "Our financial results reflect the fact that the 15% increase in production was more than offset by a 22% decrease in realized prices. We are pleased on the cost side. As on a per unit production basis, three out of the four major cost categories were lower than the prior year period. D&A expense per mcfe came in at 18% lower than last year, which is really significant. Interest expense per unit saw a 4% decrease, direct operating costs per mcfe were 3% lower than the prior period.", "On the higher side of the G&A costs, we saw an 8% increase over last year. We're still building out our Marcellus team. And we'll see the impact of that for a couple more quarters or so in G&A, before we begin to see a decline or in unit production basis like the other metrics.", "For the first nine months of the year, we have spent $780 million or 65% of our capital budget. For the year, we certainly don't want to spend more than our budget. And if anything, we may end up spending a few dollars less than budgeted. With regard to our Marcellus Shale play, we continue to make significant headway in the quarter as we continue to drill fantastic wells, filling our acreage position, test the other shale formations and continue to build out the infrastructure. I'm particularly pleased with the Marcellus acreage trade we've accomplished so far this year. In the third quarter, we did our largest trade to date. The acreage trades are difficult and very time-consuming to complete but are extremely beneficial to help to block out our acreage positions, which in turn significantly increase our capital efficiency.", "The most encouraging aspect of the quarter is the 136% increase in our NGL volumes and the drilling results in our oil and liquid-rich plays in the Midcontinent and Permian areas. Our operating teams did an excellent job quickly shifting capital and getting these projects online.", "All in all, third quarter was a very solid one. We executed on the production side, continued to reduce cost, successfully shifted capital to higher-margin liquid-rich plays and maintained a strong balance sheet. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger to review the financial results.", "Roger Manny", "Thank you, John. Financially, third quarter 2010 saw significant progress in capital efficiency, balance sheet strength and incremental cash flow growth versus the second quarter of 2010. Third quarter natural gas, NGL and oil sales, including all cash-settled derivatives totaled $245 million, down 4% from last year due to lower prices, but up from last quarter on higher production. This figure also includes $15.7 million from the early settlement of hedged 2011 oil production that was subsequently re-hedged. Year-to-date natural gas, NGL and oil revenue, including all cash-settled derivatives, totaled $696 million.", "Cash flow for the third quarter was $141 million, 18% below last year and 9% higher than the second quarter this year. Cash flow per share for the quarter was $0.88, matching the analysts' consensus estimate, year-to-date cash flow over $418 million. EBITDAX for the third quarter was $173 million, 13% lower than the third quarter of '09 but 11% higher than last quarter. EBITDAX for the year-to-date period was $505 million. Cash margins for the quarter was $3 per mcfe. That's 28% lower than last year solely due to lower gas prices.", "With the Ohio asset sale behind us, there are only a few unusual revenue and expense items to highlight in the third quarter results. Our non-cash derivative mark-to-market losses totaled $15.9 million. And our deferred compensation plan actually had a $5.3 million non-cash income posting due to declining market values of assets held in the plan.", "An income statement category appearing for the first time was a $5.4 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. This amount represents financing costs from redeeming our old 7 3/8% notes slated to mature in 2013 and replacing them with new 6 3/4% notes maturing in 2020. Our nearest long-term bond maturity is now not until 2015. The $5.4 million expense consists of $2.5 million of call premium paid to redeem the old notes and a write-off of $2.9 million of non-cash deferred financing costs also related to the old notes. This $5.4 million expense will be made up over time, as the new long-term notes carry a considerably lower interest rate than the note they replaced.", "Third quarter earnings calculated using analysts' consensus methodology was $18.9 million or $0.12 per fully diluted share. That's $0.02 higher than the analysts' consensus estimate of $0.10. And as Rodney and I always mention, the Range Resources website contains a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures including cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and analysts' earnings.", "The third quarter saw a break in our one-year string of consecutive quarterly reductions in unit direct operating expense. Third quarter cash direct operating expense, which excludes non-cash stock based compensation but includes workovers was $0.73 per mcfe. That's down $0.03 from third quarter of last year but $0.05 higher than the $0.68 seen last quarter. And while the overall operating cost reduction trend remains, the third quarter saw an uptick in well service costs and maintenance expense for well locations, roads and supplies. Now, some of this increase is seasonal, as the summer is the best time to perform field maintenance in Appalachia.", "Now we believe that our cash direct operating cost still has room to decline. And we anticipate the fourth quarter direct operating cost, excluding workovers, will be around $0.68 to $0.69 per mcfe, before declining further into the low $0.60 range next year.", "Production taxes for the third quarter remained flat to last year and also flat with the first three quarters of 2010. These came in at $0.19 per mcfe.", "General and administrative expense, adjusted for non-cash stock compensation, came in at $0.52 for the third quarter. That's up $0.06 from last year. Unit cost increased in G&A is attributable to community relations and education expense occurring in the Marcellus Shale division and to a lesser extent, inventory adjustments in our professional fees. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we anticipate G&A expense to be flat in the low $0.60 range per mcfe range.", "Interest expense for the third quarter was $0.73 per mcfe. That's down $0.03 from last year. In September, we deployed the remaining idle cash proceeds in our 1031 like exchange accounts to reduce the bank debt and utilized in the 1031 account to reinvest a portion of our Ohio asset sale proceeds, and that allowed us to help preserve our $322 million NOL carryforward. Interest expense will increase slightly in the fourth quarter, and that reflects the refinancing during the third quarter of $300 million floating-rate short-term bank debt into long-term fixed-rate notes at a higher interest rate.", "Exploration expense for the third quarter of 2010, excluding non-cash stock comp totaled $14.2 million, or $4.3 million higher than last year due to higher delay rentals, rental expense and seismic costs. The fourth quarter is anticipated to be a heavy quarter for seismic expense, as we push to complete Appalachian seismic activity before winter sets in. The total seismic expenditures are tracking our 2010 budget. Exploration expense for the fourth quarter is anticipated to be $21 million to $23 million, depending on the timing of this seismic spending.", "In terms of dollar amount each quarter, depletion, depreciation and amortization expense runs almost 3x the next largest expense category. But because DD&A is a non-cash expense, even though it's so significant, it's often relegated to second-tier importance. However, in a capital-intensive industries such as ours, the DD&A rate provides a key ongoing measure of our capital productivity.", "And our DD&A rate for the third quarter is $1.98 per mcfe. That's down from $2.42 in mcfe last year. And the last time our DD&A rate was below $2 was back in 2007. We had a rapid decline in the DD&A rate, signals a channeling of our capital spending towards the highest-returning projects in our drilling inventory and the high grading of our asset base through selective property divestitures. There was just under $6 billion in depletable assets flowing through this measure. A $0.44 reduction in DD&A within a year's time, unaided by write-downs represents a big change. The fourth quarter DD&A rate is expected to decline further, and we anticipate additional reductions add in 2011.", "We account for unproved acreage explorations impairment in accordance with our successful efforts accounting method. Under this method, costs are not included in our DD&A rate. Now we recorded impairment expense of $20.5 million in the third quarter. That's $3.5 million below last year's number. We expect this recurring non-cash expense item will again range between $20 million and $22 million in the fourth quarter, as we continue to adjust our carrying values on the acreage to reflect our current drilling plans and market conditions.", "As we experienced a GAAP basis loss before taxes, Range had no current income tax liability for the third quarter. The resulting $5.9 million tax benefit is deferred. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to hold a $322 million net operating loss carryforward to help us to shield future taxable income, including potential gains from asset sales. Our effective tax rate going into the fourth quarter is anticipated to be 39%.", "Range improved its hedge position during the third quarter of 2010, with 76% of our remaining 2010 gas production hedged, with collars at a floor price of $5.56 in Mmbtu and a cap of $7.20. We have increased our 2011 hedge position to 84% of anticipated gas production, hedged with collars at a floor price of $5.56 and a ceiling price of $6.48. We have also added to our 2012 hedge position since quarter end with 120 million in Mmbtus per day of natural gas, now hedged with collars at $5.55 and $6.25. Our oil hedges consist of 1,000 barrels per day in 2010 hedges in collars of $75 by $93.75, 5,500 barrels per day in 2011 covered by a ceiling at $80, and 2,000 barrels per day hedged in 2012 with collars set at $70 by $80 and 470 barrels a day now hedged by a ceiling of $85.", "We ended the third quarter with several key balance sheet strengthening initiatives completed. First, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior sub notes at par with a fixed interest rate of 6 3/4%. That's our second lowest coupon ever. The proceeds were used to redeem $200 million of our 7 3/8% notes that were set to mature in 2013. Thus, the proceeds were used to refinance a portion of our floating-rate bank debt.", "And second, our 26-member bank group unanimously reaffirmed our $1.5 billion credit facility borrowing base and lent a $0.25 billion revolving commitment amount. This is despite significant reductions in the price forecast used by these banks to value their clients' oil and gas reserves.", "These credit actions provide a range of over $1 billion in committed liquidity, while strengthening the maturity profile of our long-term debt and reducing our exposure to interest rate increases. The debt-to-capitalization ratio at quarter end stood at 41.8%, exactly the same book leverage ratio we had on January 1 the start of this year. As John mentioned, and I'll talk about more of it later, Range remains committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, with 2011 capital spending at or below some cash flow and asset sale proceeds.", "Summarizing the quarter, we saw a steady production growth and increasing cash flow over the second quarter and big gains in capital productivity as evidenced by the decline in DD&A rate. Our balance sheet was materially strengthened through opportunistic refinancing and the 2013 notes after 2020 and from this in the outstanding balance of our credit facility, which gives us over $1 billion in committed available liquidity. We also strengthened our already strong 2011 natural gas hedge position and doubled the natural gas we  have hedged for 2012. John, back to you.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Roger. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff to review our operations.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Thanks, John. I'll begin with the Marcellus update. Our exit rate for the third quarter of 2010 in the Marcellus was 191 million cubic feet equivalent per day net, with approximately 71% of the production being natural gas and 29% NGLs and condensate. At the end of the third quarter, approximately 34 million cubic feet equivalent per day of net production was shut in and waiting on gathering and compression facilities currently under construction. By year end, we expect all of these production will be online.", "We announced a series of great wells in the liquid-rich portion of the Marcellus play last week in our operations release. These 18 new wells look like they will exceed our five Bcfe average reserve estimate for the Southwest part of the play. The five Bcfe reserve estimate is comprised of 3.6 Bcf of gas and 239,000 barrels of liquids. At a $4 flat gas price for ever a $60 per oil price flat for ever, the rate of return from Marcellus well and the wet gas area is 60%. Fully loading this case with 100% of our current corporate G&A rate and with all land costs, the rate of return is still 47%. Running the base case with current script pricing versus the $4 flat gas and $60 flat oil, the rate of return goes from 60% up to 75% and looking at the fully loaded case and assuming script pricing, the rate of return goes from 70% up to 60%.", "Given a low gas price in our development plan to hold acreage, our plan is to drill fewer wells per pad with moderate lateral lengths and frac stages. Doing this will keep our cost to drilling complete at approximately 4 million in the Southwest, given the economics I just stated, and will keep our rate of return at 60%. We have tested longer laterals of the 5,000 feet and up to 17 frac stages. Others have experimented with even longer laterals.", "We'll continue to watch the long-term production data from these tests, which will help to determine a way to optimally drill and complete these wells from an economic point of view. The longer lateral wells are significantly more expensive and have higher mechanical risks. In the meantime, we know that in a multi-well development mode, we can drill and complete for approximately $4 million per well, which generates a 60% rate of return. We know that these economics are excellent. And we know by doing so, the wells are less expensive, and we will conserve capital. Like most others in this low gas price environment, we'll be capital-constrained. So for the same dollar amount, keeping our well costs down will allow us to drill more wells. More drilling, coupled with fewer wells per pad, will hold more acreage.", "There are other advantages as well. Drilling four wells per pad, for example, versus eight wells per pad will allow us to hook up wells faster. In practice, we drill all of the wells on a pad and frac them altogether. Logistically, it's also easier. For example, getting enough water at one time to frac four wells is easier than doing so for eight wells.", "We announced in our operations release last week that we recently completed the trade of Marcellus Shale acreage. We acquired 42,000 net acres in Washington County, Pennsylvania and transferred 55,000 net acres, of which 47,000 net acres were in West Virginia and 8,000 net acres were in Sullivan and Bradford counties in Pennsylvania. This trade worked well for both sides of the deal. From Range's perspective, we're not active in West Virginia. And the acreage positions in Sullivan and Bradford counties are scattered. The exact opposite is true from the perspective of the company we traded with. It helped them consolidate and block out in their core areas.", "For Range, the acreage we acquired in Washington County in essence filled in a lot of the missing pieces of the puzzle, or put another way, filled in a lot of the remaining gaps on our position there. Range has a very significant position in Washington County. We now have approximately 280,000 net acres there. This is an area where we have the most well performance, best gathering system and the most consolidated acreage position. In essence, all of this acreage is de-risked. Operationally, it's much more efficient for us to drill, complete and gather here.", "In addition to making Range's acreage position more operationally efficient with the trade, the term left on the leases we acquired is longer than the leases we traded. However, we acquired fewer acres than we traded. For Range, the benefits clearly outweighs the net loss of acreage. This is the fifth trade like this we've done in pursuing our long-term strategy of acreage consolidation in our key areas.", "Consolidating and blocking up our acreage makes our position more efficient in many ways. When we drill in a blocked up area, that one well holds more acreage than if it's not blocked up. It makes our gathering more efficient, and the wells are more concentrated and not as far apart, which makes our gathering cost less. The more blocked up position minimizes the cost to rig moves. It's also more efficient and a single water impoundment can service more pads than when the acreage is more consolidated.", "It's also easier on the land development and other groups in many ways, and it also benefits the community where we operate. And it allows us to better optimize our infrastructure to limit the impact on the surface. As a result of these trades, we now have fewer acres. But what we have is clearly higher quality, blocked, more efficient and increases our drillable acreage position in a number of available drill sites in the wet gas area of Southwest Pennsylvania. Our total number of acres in the fairway is now about 850,000 net acres. Of this, approximately 40% is held by production.  About 600,000 of the 850,000 net acres are in the Southwest portion of the play, and the remaining 250,000 acres are in the Northeast.", "Going forward, In addition to drilling the whole acreage, we'll continue to work on acreage trades so we can continue to consolidate our acreage position. We also have and will in the future let some of our non-strategic and isolated acreage expire. These are smaller, scattered tracks that are more on the edges of the fairway or small positions in the dry gas area, which we cannot efficiently develop. Although we will have fewer acres, we believe that by concentrating in the highest productive areas, we will still have the same upside and make it easier to capture.", "Last week in our operations release, we disclosed the result of our first upper Devonian Shale test. The average seven-day test rate for this well was 5.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day. This is a very significant test for us. It shows that the interval that looked productive on logs and then had gas shows is indeed productive. Also for our very first try out-of-the-box in this horizon, the rate is pretty impressive. It's doubtful that on our first try, we landed the lateral with the optimum location. I'm also pretty confident that we didn't optimally stimulate it, so there's likely significant upside.", "It's encouraging that the reservoir pressure that we encountered is about the same as in Marcellus in this area, which is over-pressured. If thermal maturity is also similar to the Marcellus and should roughly track it in regard to the wet and dry portions. The gas in plays for the bulk or where we believe the play is most prospective ranges from 60 to 100 Bcf per square mile. Importantly, it directly overlies a lot of our Marcellus acreage in the Southwest, where the Marcellus gas in place averages 75 to 125 Bcf per square mile. Since it stacks together on our acreage, the aggregate gas in place in the Southwest is estimated to be 135 to 225 Bcf per square mile. It literally sits right on top of the Marcellus.", "We're still holding our Utica test results confidential for now. Range drilled the first horizontal Utica well in the Appalachian Basin. CNX is still holding  [indiscernible] the well, and others are currently drilling. We feel that a lot of our acreage is prospective for the Utica Shale as well. The build-out of the infrastructure continues on schedule. Details were outlined in the operations report last week and are listed on our website. First production in Lycoming County is expected at year end.", "I'll now move to the Midcontinent and talk about some of our plays there. In our release last week, we announced a couple of outstanding Woodford wells that are in the Ardmore Basin in Marshall County, Oklahoma. The first well tested at an average rate of 801 barrels of oil and NGLs per day and plus 2.3 million cubic feet of gas per day or 1,176 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And the second well tested 1,064 barrels of oil and NGLs per day and 2.7 million cubic feet of gas per day or 1,514 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We have 19,200 gross acres and about 7,800 net acres in this play. About 3/4 of this acreage is currently held by production. There are 221 well locations on this acreage, of which Range would operate about half of them. We have drilled and completed 12 operated wells to date. And our more recent wells look like they will recover on a per well basis about four Bcf, 35,000 barrels of oil and about 625,000 barrels of NGLs. That is about eight Bcfe or 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per well depending on how you look at it.", "The wells have a TVD of about 7,000 feet and the current laterals are about 5,000 feet. The cost of drilling complete is about $4 million per well. At the current script pricing, the rate of return is 98%.", "The next play in our Midcontinent division that I want to discuss is our horizontal Mississippian play. In Northern Oklahoma, Range has announced another strong horizontal Mississippian well that tested at a rate 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We now have five wells in the area.  Currently we have approximately 15,000 net acres in this play. This is a horizontal redevelopment of an old field that was drilled vertically. We have identified 108 wells to drill here. About half of our acreage in this play is held by production.", "The true vertical depth of the Mississippian section here is about 5,000 feet and the laterals are about 2,200 feet. The horizontal wells in the development mode will cost about $2.1 million to drill and complete. Reserves are estimated to be about 300,000 barrels per well. This is comprised of 536 million cubic feet of gas, 80,000 barrels of oil and 128,000 barrels of NGLs. At current script pricing, this results in an 80% rate of return.", "In addition, Range controls about 80,000 gross for 42,000 net legacy acres that are all held by production in the Cana Shale play in the Anadarko Basin. Roughly 2/3 of the net acreage is in Blaine and Canadian counties and roughly 1/3 is in the very southern part of Major County. The Blaine and Canadian County acreage is either in the heart of the play or directly on trend with industry activity. The southern part of Major County is where the Cana is in the oil window and shallower. In souther Major County, the true vertical depth of the Cana well would be about 85,000 feet versus about 13,000 feet in Blaine and Canadian counties.", "Recent Devon completions have reported sustained 30-day rates from seven million to eight million cubic feet per day and are located about three to four miles southeast of Range's holdings. Additional activity by Continental Resources has been reported at 5.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day and lies on trend within 10 to 12 miles of Range's legacy acreage. Numerous well permits have been issued adjacent to a large range block in southern and central Blaine County, which lies between both areas of activity.", "In the Southwestern division, we announced three new wells in the Barnett Shale and Denton County that were brought online with a gross combined rate of 15 million cubic feet equivalent per day. That's comprised of 8.1 million cubic feet of gas per day and 1,156 barrels of NGLs and oil. In addition, we've just recently completed five new wells at Tarrant County and are in the process of completing three more wells. In aggregate, we expect these wells to come online at rates of 32 million per day gross or 22.5 million per day net.", "We also continued our successful deepening of wells in Conger Field coupled with the successful Wolfcamp recompletion. These four wells averaged 561 barrels of oil equivalent per day each. We have been mapping the horizontal oil potential work properties in the Permian basin. To date, we believe we have about 155 gross and 118 net locations combined between our Conger Field and Powell Ranch properties in West Texas and Loving properties in Southeast New Mexico. Our first well will be in Powell Ranch and should spud early next year.", "The target formation at Conger and Powell Ranch is primarily the Wolfcamp Shale and the target formation in New Mexico is the Avalon Shale in Bone Spring. All of our acreage in these three field is held by production.", "In the Nora area, which is all dry gas and all either held by production or we own the minerals, we have significantly slowed down our drilling. For example, our CBM drilling this year is about half of our 2009 program, which was significantly less than the prior year. Our high graded efforts are focused on re-completions, optimizing the compression and gathering in the field and drilling in our most prospective areas. Back to you, John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Jeff. Good update.", "Looking to the remainder of 2010, we see continued strong operating results. For the fourth quarter, we're looking for production average roughly 535 million equivalents per day, representing a 17% increase year-over-year. Fourth quarter production will reflect the sale of the Ohio properties in March of this year. So the 17% fourth quarter production growth estimate equates to 23% after adjusting for property sales.", "As Roger mentioned, we expect fourth quarter unit cost to continue to decline. Importantly, we have 76% of our fourth quarter natural gas production hedged at an average floor of $5.56 and a cap of $7.20.", "Also we're confident that our all-in 2010 finding and development costs will come in at or below $1 per mcfe. This will help us to continue to drive down our DD&A rate in the fourth quarter and into 2011 as well.", "Let's now shift gears a bit and discuss our announcement that we have decided to market our Barnett Shale properties. Over the last three months, we've conducted a full review of all of our properties, including both producing and nonproducing properties. After considering all the alternatives, we concluded that selling the Barnett Shale properties best fits our strategy of growing production reserves on a per share basis at low cost.", "While we like our Barnett Shale properties, and our team has done a great job at developing them, we are in an enviable position of having a very deep inventory of high-quality projects. As a result, we believe taking the proceeds from the sale of the Barnett and redeploying that sales proceeds into our other projects over the next several years will accelerate the value generation process. Because of our $322 million of NOLs and capitalized IDCs, we don't expect any cash taxes on the sale.", "Other than being much larger, the Barnett Shale in many ways is similar to Ohio sale we completed earlier this year. In the Ohio sale, we sold properties producing approximately 25 million a day for $325 million or $13,000 per flowing Mmcfe per day. As a side note, when we announced the Ohio sale, the general consensus of the investment community is that we would received sales proceeds of $225 million to $250 million for the Ohio properties. The actual sales price we received was $325 million or 37% higher than the midpoint of the investment community consensus. It took us only three months to replace the 25 million that we sold in the Ohio sale, and we did it at price of $3,000 per flowing mcfe or roughly a third of what we sold the Ohio properties for.", "With the Barnett sale, our objective is the same. We expect to replace the 120 million to 130 million per day we lose in the sale by no later than year end 2011, which is at a faster replacement rate than we accomplished with the Ohio sale. In addition, we expect to replace production at roughly a third of the cost like the Ohio sale.", "And in addition to being able to replace the sole production reserves at a fast-pace, sales of this type also improved our ongoing cost structure. It's one of the reasons why we've seen our direct operating costs and DD&A rate decline sharply. With the Barnett sale, we will see a further drop in our cost structure.", "Obviously, we'll only sell the Barnett properties if we receive what we believe is a fair price. After discussing the sale with several outside advisors, combined with the recent inquiries we have already received from several potential buyers, we are confident that there is a broad market for the Barnett properties. Just this week, a sizable Barnett sale was announced, which shall validate the market value for our Barnett properties. In addition, over 80% of our Barnett properties are located in the core of the play and more than 80% of drilling locations are also located in the core of the play. So we believe it's a very high quality set of Barnett properties that will command a very solid price. Now assuming we receive a price we are satisfied with, we expect to close the sale sometime in the first quarter of 2011.", "While not a primary reason for the sale, given the size of the Barnett Shale, it should provide substantial clarity as to how we're going to fund our future growth over the next several years. In particular, while looking to 2011 and beyond, we believe we'll be very well-positioned. First assuming it sell at a good price, we'll have a rock-solid balance sheet. Second, we'll have substantial cash and liquidity to capture the opportunities we see before us. Third, our natural gas hedge position will protect us from low natural gas prices. And fourth, we can methodically develop our liquid-rich plays in the Marcellus as well as in the Midcontinent and Permian areas.", "To provide perspective, our Barnett properties consist of 53,000 net acres. As Jeff mentioned, in our Cana acreage, which is all held by production, we have 42,000 net acreage, almost the same as our Barnett acreage. So we do have a lot of opportunities in the Permian and in the Midcontinent that we're very excited about.", "I'll now take a moment to discuss the regulatory environment in Marcellus Shale play. The regulatory environment has improved in many ways over the past two years. First, the drilling permit process in Pennsylvania has gotten much, much more predictable. And we are regularly receiving permits within 30 days or less. Second, the water access and flowback process is much more predictable, especially given that Range is recycling 100% of its flow back water the southwest portion of the play. The Pennsylvania DEP is very supportive of our recycling program. It's not only a better environmental solution, but it saves Range money as well.", "We also received all the necessary air permits for all the compressor size that are currently under construction. With regards to a severance tax in Pennsylvania, the state has yet to enact the tax. During the past several years, we and the rest of the industry have worked very hard to educate and work with the Pennsylvania legislature about the issues surrounding the severance tax, encouraging them to take a holistic approach whereby any severance tax would come with balance of regulatory modernization. We believe that both candidates running for the Pennsylvania governorship will take a much more commercial and diplomatic approach towards the legislature versus the current administration. With the election less than a week away, we believe the chances of a holistic approach will increase significantly once the new administration takes office, irrespective of which candidate wins the governorship.", "Turning to the hedging front. Just to reiterate that we are well protected in terms of natural gas prices. For the fourth quarter, we're 76% of our anticipated natural gas productions hedged at a of floor $5.56. Importantly when you look at 2011, we have over 80% of our production hedged at a floor of $5.57. And this year, we have a nice hedge position already in 2012 as well.", "Lastly to expand on a point mentioned in our news release, our infrastructure build-out in the Marcellus Shale is sadly on schedule. While there is always some delay for surface facilities build-out at each pass side in and the Southwest portion of the play, we are at the point where pipeline and processing pass is no longer an issue. Our acreage trades, as Jeff mentioned, have really helped us out to get us into that position.", "In the Northeast, the first phase of the Lycoming County pipeline system is nearing completion. It will be exciting to see how our initial wells perform once we get them on production in late December or early January. As you recall, our first two Lycoming wells had some of the best test rates of all the wells we drilled in the Marcellus Shale play to date. Most wells had seven-day average test rates of over 13 million a day each. Once the Lycoming County production goes online, we'll have two separate core areas from which to accelerate our Marcellus production and reserve growth. This will provide us additional flexibility and will help us diversify our production base.", "Because our infrastructure build-out is progressing so well, coupled with excellent well results, there's little doubt that we'll achieve the 2010 Marcellus exit rate goal of 200 million to 250 million a day net. More importantly, it sets the stage for doubling production again to 400 million a day plus an exit rate for 2011. So that's very exciting news.", "With that, operator, why don't we turn the call over to questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Rehan Rashid with FBR Capital Markets.", "Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Could  you walk us through the direction of operating costs or unit operating cost as you've kind of rolled out the next four, six quarters' worth of production growth from the Marcellus?", "John Pinkerton", "Let me start at kind of high level, and I'll move down a bit. And Jeff and Roger, please chime in. There's really two reasons why you've seen a material drop in our operating costs over the last year or so. First the production we're adding, in particular the Marcellus, is a lot lower than the average production rate of our current properties. Currently in the Marcellus, LOE rate's somewhere in the $0.30 to $0.35 range. The other thing is the sale of our higher cost properties. So again as you take that money and recycle it out of the higher cost properties and move it into the lower cost properties, you get kind of a double whammy approach of LOE decrease. And as Roger mentioned, we had third quarter is $0.73, which is $0.05 higher than we had hoped for some reasons that Roger mentioned. But we should be back under $0.70 and the upper $0.60 range in the fourth quarter, which, especially in Appalachia, tends to be a little higher quarter because of all the road maintenance and all the weather issues you get in the winter time up there. But when you look at our 2011, we're going to be continuing to decrease it. Our goal is to be in the low $0.60 range hopefully for 2011, trending hopefully below that towards the end of the year. And then again as we move into 2012, we ought to see continued decrease of that as well. And as I mentioned, the Marcellus is in the $0.30 to $0.35 range. So as more and more of our production becomes Marcellus, you'll see that trend down. And again the key here is when you connect all the dots at the end of 2011 or end of this year, we'll be at 200 million a day plus, which is a double. Then the next year, 2011, we'll be 400 million a day plus. So you'll see that a big piece of our production will be Marcellus, so that will help drive down. The other thing is that as we build out the Marcellus, I think our guys will get better, and the operating process will get more refined. It will be more repetitive, and they'll just get better at it. They've done that in every field that we've ever operated. So we haven't built-in that into the any of the numbers. But it's going to be a process. It's not going to be an event, but I think you'll continue to see it. In addition to the LOEs, I think Roger mentioned one of the really big, big drivers, in my view, in this business is going to be watching all the respective companies' DD&A rates. I've heard a lot of talk about that we're going to be in a low gas pricing environment for a few years here. And I don't know whether, I'm not going to say the right or wrong. But I think one of the real keys is to be able to be consistently profitable, one of the biggest things to get there is going to be the DD&A rate. And if you have a really high DD&A rate, it's going to be very  hard to be consistently profitable in a low-price environment. So one of the things that we're really focused on and has a lot to do with where we spend our money and also assets that we sell and whatnot is really forcing that DD&A rate down. I'm taking a very disciplined approach towards that and a very methodical approach towards that end, to be able to reduce the $0.40 already this year, I think you'll see a rapid decline as we move forward, especially when you think about a $1 F&D rate for last year and this year. And hopefully for 2011 as well, we'll be able to hopefully really force that DD&A rate down, which will allow us to be consistently profitable in a low-price environment, which will obviously add to shareholders' equity and increase assets. So it's all part of our strategy at Range.", "Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "As you think about capital allocation for next year, how much,  and do we have to direct towards, let's just say, drilling in the Northeast Pennsylvania for holding acreage, which is of course dry gas versus being able to disproportionately allocate capital towards the more liquids-rich Southwest and Pennsylvania area.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "The bulk of our drilling is still in the liquids-rich wet area. But I think we'll be adding -- now at Northeast will be coming online. It would be interesting to watch the performance of the wells and to change that from acreage value into PDP value. But we'll still directing the bulk of our activity found in the Woodford.", "Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "So 70% to 80% would be a good ballpark number?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, we'll come out with numbers later on in the year like we typically do when we released our budget, we'll have all that detail in there or early next year when we release that. But yes, it will be a significant portion.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dave Kistler from Simmons & Company.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company International", "The choice of the Barnett assets versus maybe Permian assets or Cana Woodford assets, given the kind of relationship between gas and oil, the kind of 20:1, can you walk us through that? And should we be reading anything into your view on dry gas versus liquids-rich versus liquids in general?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Really, what we do, we did a really thorough analysis, looking into all of our assets, literally put everything on the table. And we went through that analysis, there's a lot of consideration. So one consideration is what assets are currently selling for, where you can market things, where we think we can get fair value relative to how we view them. We also looked at what we view or are the upside of the various properties that we have. And one of the things about the Fort Worth basin and the Barnett Shale is it's really a single-pay horizon. We have great properties, a lot of gas in play. But one of the advantages of things like really the Appalachian Basin and the Permian or Midcontinent is you have stacked pays and lot of water hydrocarbon in plays, new technology, horizontal drilling that's really unlocking, it allow us to recover a lot more horizon. So we felt with the valuations and particularly with the recent transaction that John said, we could raise a lot of money at we think a fair price. And it would really do a lot of us, and John talked about all those of different things. While at the same time from our perspective, retain a lot of the upside that we really like. So those are some of the considerations that were in there.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company International", "And then with respect to having additional capital come into the company and be redeployed towards the Marcellus, I believe on the last conference call, you talked about kind of peak Marcellus rates about 2 to 3 Bcf a day of production and kind of I think were targeting about a 2013 time frame for that. Does that potentially get accelerated? And how should we think about the growth? Obviously you've indicated, you'll backfill what you'll lose in the Barnett, but really thinking about trying to triangulate the capital spending going forward", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, let's work at different pieces of that. Like we said, when you look at the Barnett at sale time, it will be 120 million to 130 million per day net. In the Marcellus next year, we're going to go from 200 million to 400 million net. So we'll more than make up the Barnett within 12 months. Going forward and on the last call, I did talk about, I believe, the most exciting part about the Marcellus, as we drill and other people drill, the quality of play keeps expanding. It gets better, it gets broader. So the acreage we have primarily, a lot of it looks really good. So we have the opportunity with the position we have to drive rates up to, I believe, two to three Bcf per day net. We have that kind of potential. We did not put a time frame on it, as far as I'm aware. But we'll come out, when we come out with our capital budget early next year like we do, we'll continue to paint out the picture and connect the dots so you can see what that is. We'll be very mindful of where we're drilling, and, the rates of return that we're getting will be very capital-disciplined. But we think we got a great opportunity to capture. And really, this sale will allow us to do that and do it in -- like John said, our focus is about growth per share at low cost; growth per share, both reserves and production that adjusted at low cost. And we think you'll see it continue to funnel a lot of money into the Marcellus. Eventually the Marcellus will go cash flow positive, and we'll continue to paint that up with time when we've captured than we have in a lot of the areas, a lot of great opportunities to continue to grow. When you look at the rates of some of the Woodford wells, those are impressive, 1,000 to 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And in Galum, [ph] Mississippi, 400 to 500 barrels per day. We think that our properties in the Permian have a lot of that Bone Spring, Avalon, Wolfcamp potential that others are doing. So we think we're in a great, great position.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company International", "Just in terms of trying to increase the predictability of the returns coming out of the Marcellus, as you talked about hedging et cetera, do you look at potentially vertically integrating there in terms of any services, businesses you'd want to get more deeply involved with, especially as we're looking at kind of a backlog of drilled uncompleted wells up there.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Our team's done a really good job of well one, planning ahead, not just one-year and two-year, but five-year and 10-year and looking the whole way through depletion. So we know the rigs we need and the fractures we need and the takeaway capacity and staff size and office space. And they've done a really good job of planning. And we think our strengths and what we're really good at is exactly what we're doing, building reserves and production per share at low cost. We're not drillers, we're not frac guys. But we've wind up and locked in the services we need in order to accomplish the task that we want to accomplish, and we've already done that. So I don't anticipate that we're going to end those businesses.", "John Pinkerton", "And plus, just add on to Jeff's comment there, it's just like the pipeline of processing business. We don't believe that's our strength. Other thing is, I think, obviously we're very mindful of the amount of capital it takes to do those things too. They're not free. It takes a lot of upfront capital to fund those and whatnot. So again, it's just trying to allocate your capital. But you're also trying to focus your expertise in areas where you think you can have the biggest impact. So I think it's a combination of both those things.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Gil Yang with Bank of America.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Can you comment on after the sales of Barnett whether or not your bank line and credit would need to be reduced, by how much?", "Roger Manny", "Gil, this is Roger. We don't anticipate any reductions there. That's best we can tell, we don't have the new $4 and slide escalation case the banks are using in this modern day season. We've got ample borrowing base capacity that we haven't elected to use over and above that $1.5 billion number. So I think we're going to in good shape there.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "What is it exactly?", "Roger Manny", "We're currently at $1.5 billion borrowing base. But we've probably got easily another $500 million to $700 million over that if we needed it. So I think we've got a big enough cushion in there over and above our existing commitment to accommodate the sale.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And you said something about earlier that the $34 million that they shut in would go away at some point. When would that go away?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "By year end.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And is it usual that you won't have any shut-ins, so there's no sort of shut-in inventory, so to speak?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Whether any company, on any play, on any area, anywhere in the world at any point in time, would be actively drilling is going to have wells in various stages of completion and shut-in. There were some confusion in our operations released last week, hopefully not by too many people but least by one individual who said there's infrastructure problems. There's no infrastructure problem. That's just part of the normal build-out and flow that you see the team again is doing a good job of staying ahead of the drilling machine. So that will go away, but there'll be some other wells. And that's just part of a normal business and our normal business and everyone else's taboo.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Can you quantify what normally would be there? I know it will go off announced but it's a bit more like five Bs day shut-in or....", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, you said Bs per day, let me clarify that. It's roughly $30 million. So when you bring a pad on, you have four wells on a pad, maybe 25 million or 30 million you have wells more, if you have one or two wells, it will be less so it will be in those ranges.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Can you sort of just say anything in terms of the 44 I guess wells waiting in completion? What would be sort of normal number, and when you get to expect to get the normal number?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "That's probably going to slow up and down, maybe it will be somewhere in the range of 25 to 50 or something like that at any point in time. This isn't like the Bakken. We're not waiting or parts of the Permian, we're not waiting on frac crews or things like that, if that's what you're getting at.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And then, do you plan to update what your expected or what views are when you report reserves? When do you think...", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well we do year end reserves, and we typically I think put that on in February. We'll probably continue to update it. I think we've been very transparent showing you our team's progression and how we've driven out production for time and recovers per well with time, so we'll continue to try to do that.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And then in the quarter you said I think $60 or so on land and acreage, could you comment on where that is? Is that for the bonus extension that you've talked about for the labor and rental payment you talked about, or there's something else going on?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "About $50 million of that is in the Marcellus. And of that, 2/3 of it or 65% are new leases. So the rest of it is extensions and renewals. And the other $15 million is scattered amongst the three divisions.", "John Pinkerton", "And the new leases, just to put some color on that, is picking the little bits and pieces in and around our big blocks where we're just filling in.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Those are all right. What we're saying the wells are 5 billions and fully loaded at strip pricing of 60% rate of return, it's all right there, three acres here, five acres there.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "When you swap acreage or comment that you swap acres, there's no cash involved with that, right?", "John Pinkerton", "Sometimes we've actually, and we've done five trades. And so far all of them have been, no cash has been involved. I can assure you, there are no discussions. Oftentimes there were, a time or two in terms of there was some discussion of selling some cash into making the number of acres worked out and everything else. It's just at the end of the day, it's just been net acres for net acres. And try to put them together. And that's one good thing I think now that the play is getting more mature. All the operators are coming to the same conclusion I think that we have several years ago is blocking of their acreage it's really, really important. And the capital and the low price environment is really important. So that has facilitated a lot of the acreage trace. And quite frankly we've got four or five others that we're working on. And again, they take a really long time because everybody do their acreage slightly better than yours and negotiations and whatnot. So they just take a long, long time to work out. But the good news is the fact that we've done a five, and we got a number more that we're looking at. I think it tells you that the play's getting more mature, people are getting more comfortable with our technical views of different acreage. And it's allowing these trades to get done. And I just said, it's a win-win deal. One good thing about a trade is you're not selling out for cash, you're actually, in most cases, it's one plus one equals three because both sides getting something as benefit. And so that's why they work. Again they just take a long time to work out in most cases.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I want to finish this up, along those line with the roughly 40 million or 35 million that you're spending to buy new acreage to fill in those gaps, are you also selling something that are sort of out there, that you can't trade it but you just sort of don't really need it?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "We did one very small deal like that a couple of years ago. And going forward, we'll look at optimizing our position as best we can. And that will be drilling the hole, renewing some stuff, filling in  holes by buying, trading, it may be letting some stuff expire and maybe selling little bits here and there. It will be all of the above.", "uppertor", "Our next question is from line of Leo Mariani from RBC.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "In the Marcellus, just curious as to how the rig ramp is progressing, how menu horizontal rigs do you guys have today, and kind of where you expect to be in a year or two?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "We have six big rigs today. And we'll probably pick up on another three by the end of first quarter next year and stay there for that of your. So we're still putting those plans together, and of course there's some small rigs in front of them. We're going to be very capital disciplined.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "And obviously, you guys are slightly tweaking the way you approach it there in terms of fewer wells per pad and shorter laterals. How much does it take to take the return?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "I think the jury is still out. Like I said with the laterals we're drilling, the economics are pretty spectacular and part of that is we're in the wet gas area and the quality of the wells and everything else. And we're looking at great rates of return, doing. We have drilled a number of wells and will watch the long-term production with time plus watch each others people's long-term production through time. And really at the end of the day, it's very how you economic loss and that's answered this in certainty of that answer, we'll know a lot more next year than we'll know now. For sure, you know that a longer lateral, if you put 30 stages in a well versus eight, you're going to get a higher IP. The  question is if you get a better rate of return. We're still looking at laterals and that, they'll be in that 2,500 a little bit more that 3,000 eight stage, maybe 10 stage jobs and those are fantastic rates for return. We've got some of those experiments in there, We'll just watch wash them and look.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "In terms of the Permian, how much total acreage do you guys have out there, and it seems like pretty early days in your investigation of a lot of these for the new horizons even though it's in the Marcellus quite a bit for the last couple of years. Is that a fair realization in terms of the Permian?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, no. We have different that were different things. We have quite a bit acreage, what I try to do is rather than just talk about acreage, talk about geology and deal focus. So those number that I just gave in terms of the Permian, were based on all of that work, and it's a 155 gross and hundred 18 that maybe we do have a lot of acreage out there and we're in a good hydrocarbon rich area. Like I said, we'll start our first wells there first quarter next year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "Question on just the Barnett properties. If you compare those to the talent properties in terms of production mix, I know that they had plus almost 30% if you associate with their production, a lot of different properties I think with overlapped in some of your 120 million to 130 million a day of production, what's the production profile of that gas versus the deal.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "If you have that talent properties, they're roughly, they're 29% liquid, 71% gas. If you look at ours, well, they're 71% gas, we're 81%, and the difference is liquid. So they have a little bit more liquid bur it's not tremendously higher. When you look at the overlap of property, they really don't overlap very well. Calen [ph] is predominantly west of us. Almost all of their acreage is in Parker County. And when you look at a lot of our acreage, it's more on the quarter to play to proven core and a lot of it is in Johnson counties. So when you look at the quality of the wells in those areas, and it's public wells, the quality of the well is clearly higher there. So that's important. When you look at they're 71% gas, we're 81%, they're a little more liquids. But when you look at acreage, our acreage is clearly more in the core. The other thing is when you look at, I'll just do gross to gross on acreage, they announced 20,000 gross acreage is what they had in the package. We have 64,000 gross acres and out to be net to net. But we have basically more than 3x the acreage in a higher quality area. So I think that's how it compares.", "John Pinkerton", "And Ron, the other thing I think is important is the production profile is slightly different either. As you know, we've only had one or two rigs Barnett for a good long time here. And so, our production kind of comes by the decline curve. They got those properties some other guys and put a bunch of money and ramp the production up, which is what I do in almost all properties too. But their production rate is at the higher end of that curve deeper into the current than ours. And you know, I think that has an impact in terms of relative value to somebody. So there's a lot that goes into it. We always been known to those properties pretty well. We actually look at that onetime. And our team obviously because we've spent him fair amount of time. So we're not saying that the properties aren't in good properties for most of the say what the financial terms as we can in terms of the relative quality of these assets. Still good quality assets and we've got some a lot of people talent call us announcing that want to know our thoughts on it and would it be to adjusted so we have a pretty good insight in terms of that as well as some it all comes that the decision that they made but at the end of the they come it all comes down in a \"no\" quickly a couple of months three months. So that's kind of where we stand.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "And I'm looking back to older presentations and press releases, both of your three plus Bcfe of crude reserves and the production percent plus or minus a quarter of the production is the reserve split pretty similar or is there a significant difference of Barnett deserves versus the production?", "John Pinkerton", "For obvious reasons, we're not going to get direct. One is a don't disclose reserves on a segment basis because it's not a segment business. Anything is not our best interest to do that in terms of the process. So we were looking that confidential for the time being.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "Just trying to back into on a relative margin of Barnett versus your Southwestern division versus Marcellus division, trying to back into what the EBITDAX margin is on the Barnett.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "This is what we're going to do in the sales process and I don't want to go into detail, but I'll say on that sale, when we look at our lower cost, it will help lower our DD&A and it will help our elderly. It's positive for us in terms of getting to know. We're adding in getting to dollars for the Marcellus are just getting better plus an average and higher than the those areas. So have continued to drive down those costs.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "You talked about the redeployment of capital. One thing with the discussion of a number of liquids plays that you discussed in the past when you look at the redeployment of capital, we should an expectation be to redeployment of that in the liquid or some of the newer liquid phase you identified versus all of that being redeployed on the Marcellus.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "We're going through a rigorous analysis of our budget and no look at where we will discussions like to turn trying new concepts holding acreage and all of those types of things. You see the bulk of the cap that goes even more works as John said in the past, will have one or two drilled in the Barnett obviously and we'll be looking at and not mindful of a aspects of our business.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "Jeff, but the CapEx budget that you've all talked about for this year, But the total CapEx this year, you've spent on development plus or  minus $600 million so far.

Is that accurate?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "The numbers are on our website and that's roughly $1.2 million budget. And we spent about $700 million, $765 million. But if you look on our website, the exact budget is that an if match at what's in there and you see where the exact numbers on that.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "On the Marcellus, on the press release, can you talk about the conditions that was used to describe the IP-based of the 18 Marcellus well stood in the quarter? I think you're talking about six side but what chokes I'd vote for load and maybe just a deliberate move to maintain that pressure are really just to make it at the position you to restrict the volumes?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "If you look at our wells, we had our best wells so far down there when you look at unconstrained. At the end of 2008, we knew we have $20 million a day and you decide to see what we can do. It came in at $26 million per day. And that's million is about a Bcfe well. So we've had other mouth as she that are really strong like that and the multiple wells could be over $50 million per day. so we decided to do after that first well is rather than design really everything is the highest rates and from the economic point of view, we believe it's better to design for what more of an average rate is versus what our wells make on peak. So it's about optimizing about maximizing rates and issues. So you can make it been like that Haynesville where you guys have pressure and really high pusher pressures so you have soft rock for crushing and all kinds of things in order to minimize that early on that district the rates. And it's a much different situation. We don't need high-strength profits were frac-ing bitterly with 100 other things like that and to standard that are inexpensive. So yes, all those have the capacity. We were just designing for ICs and the urge building and just producing a lot of fuss over 20 million per day and we started putting 20 stage fracs or 20 stage facts. We would get some fantastic growth and we're really looking at rates of returns and we have maximizing the project getting capital discipline and watching that over time.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Mindful of the sensitivity of that sale process on the Barnett Shale assets but just for the basis of comparison and get a better handle on what you're selling, is from a field level economics point of view, if you run the fully loaded economics of the Barnett Shale assets, like you run on the Marcellus, what the IRR at $4 or $5 gas and I assume that would exclude cash interest cost and cash taxes?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "The easiest thing to do is just look at our website and report our economics out of the same gas prices whether the average who will be on the Barnett versus the Marcellus versus. So just open the book. So that $4, that 60% rate of return in the Marcellus at $4 on the Barnett is 23.

We really appreciate everybody taking the time to join us today. It's really a very exciting time at Range. Think of Range and even going back two or three years, is the idea that we would sell our Barnett properties is pretty amazing. And I think it really tells you how far the company has come over the last two or three years for the management team and as Jeff and I think it would also extend to we've taken a lot of time to think through this discussion or decision. We spent a lot of time with the Board in terms of making this decision.", "But I think it's really exciting. I think what that tells you it's the confidence level for us to think that we 120 to 130 million of production for 12 months or less, we couldn't get any closer to that two or three years ago. So I think it's a complete sea change in terms of the capability of the company and the capital efficiency. Also I think it really beckons the fact that management really is very confident in not only Marcellus but these other projects that we've got and our ability to execute. And I think that really reads well and reads, shines through in terms of our decision here with the Barnett.", "And at the end of the day, we look at the business fairly simply. We want to drive up production and reserves on a per share basis, just adjusted it low cost. And our view here is if we can do that time and time again over time, we'll drive up value. And we're obviously mindful of prices. I think we've got one of the best hedged positions of anybody in the sector for the rest of this year and for 2011. And we've got one of the more economic plays. We've got the largest position in what a lot of people believe is the most economic oil and gas play in North America. So it's a very exciting time here at Range. We're extremely excited.", "And lastly, I think that from a shareholder perspective, I think it's a bit bold. I think it puts us here and put to rest the fears of how we're going to fund our capital over the next couple of years.. Clearly, if we sell the Barnett at a good and reasonable price -- and obviously we're hoping for a very good price. But even at very good deferred price, that the amount of capital that brings in will be enormous.", "We only have $165 million of bank debt. So Roger will have his biggest issue is how to invest all that cash, until we can redeploy it. And we're going to take some time to redeploy. We're not going to obviously going to rush out and do it all at once.", "So it's really an exciting time, and we've talked to a number of the large shareholders. And it seems most people really like the decision we made. For those of you all that are still might view it differently, we tried to be as transparent as we possibly can. Call Rodney and I and Jeff and Roger will be happy to take you through we think it makes sense and why we think it's in the best interest of all the shareholders of Range. Thank you again and we'll talk to you at the year-end earnings.", "uppertor", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney Waller", "Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, and welcome. Yesterday, Range reported results for 2010, announced the sale of our Barnett Shale properties and announced our capital spending for 2011. We want to leave as much time as possible to answer questions today, so we're going to move directly into our speakers. ", "On the call with me today are John Pinkerton, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Ventura, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Roger Manny, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "Let me turn it over to John. John?", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Rodney. Overall, we're very pleased with fourth quarter and full year 2010 results. On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter production rose 18%, beating the high end of our guidance. Fourth quarter production averaged $541 million a day, a record high for Range. This also represented our 32nd consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. For the year, production rose 14%.  Adjusting for the property sales, production would have risen by 19%. At year end, crude reserves totaled 4.4 Tcf, a 42% increase over 2009. This represented a reserve replacement of 931% from all sources. Our SG&A cost averaged $0.71 per mcfe, the lowest in our history.  Our drilling program delivered 840% reserve replacement at a cost of $0.59 per mcfe.", "These results reflect selling properties which contained 189 Bcfe and removing 230 Bcfe due to the five-year development rule. Based on what we see to date, these look like some of the best if not the best results in the industry. ", "We combined exceptional growth in production reserves with low find and development cost. That is the hard part of our business, combining high growth with low costs. Again, this performance is attributable to our high-return, low-cost drilling inventory coupled with a very talented and dedicated technical team. Importantly, once again, both production and reserves per share on a debt-adjusted basis increased by over 10%. At Range, it's all about per-share results, as we believe that is what drives valuation. From a financial perspective, we continued our disciplined and simple approach.  Bank debt declined, while total debt rose modestly. Debt per mcfe of reserves declined both on total proved and on a proved developed basis. We ended the year with almost $1 billion of liquidity under our bank credit facility, and, importantly, as the largest individual shareholder of Range, I was very happy and pleased to see that the average shares outstanding rose only by 1.1% during 2010. ", "I'm also pleased what we didn't do in 2010. Other than a small $135-million very attractive acquisition of properties directly offsetting our Nora field, we stayed disciplined and focused on developing our Marcellus position and our other key projects. ", "In summary, 2010 was a value-creating year in that production reserves per share both rose more than 10%. Our find and development cost of $0.71 looks to be the one of the lowest in the industry. We continue to drive down our unit cost, in particular, our find and development cost and our lease operating costs both materially decreased. Lastly, we maintained a strong balance sheet and ended the year with the most liquidity in our history.  I want to take a moment to congratulate the entire Range team for a job very well done in 2010. ", "Now instead of following our more traditional conference call format, I'm going to focus on what we believe are the key issues facing Range today. Said another way, I'm going to try to attempt to connect the dots as we look forward. ", "First, let's focus on the balance sheet. We expect to close the Barnett sale in late April. Upon closing, we will pay down our bank debt facility, or bank credit facility, to zero and have roughly $400 million of invested cash. As recently announced, we have renewed and extended our bank credit facility.  Despite eliminating the Barnett property, our borrowing base increased by $500 million. In addition, we extended the term to 2016, reduced the cost and added more flexible covenants. ", "So with the completion of the Barnett sale combined with the new credit facility, we will have by far the strongest balance sheet in our history. We will have go-forward liquidity of $1.9 billion and no debt maturities until 2015. ", "Second, let's discuss the Barnett sale we announced yesterday. We have recently announced our intention to sell the Barnett properties in October of last year. We looked at all the alternatives and concluded selling the Barnett properties was the most accretive course of action. ", "Our decision to sell the Barnett property was strengthened by the exemplary results we were having in the Marcellus, Nora, Midcontinent and Permian basin. Given our results in these areas and our extensive inventory of opportunities, we believe recycling the Barnett sales proceeds into these higher-return projects was the right thing to do for Range and its shareholders. While we prefer to sell properties in a higher price environment, our thought was that we would reinvest the proceeds back into higher-return projects in essentially the same relative natural gas price environment. ", "Said another way, if we felt the futures prices for natural gas were going to move materially higher in the near term, we would have waited for prices to rebound before selling the Barnett properties. Very simply, we view the sale as recycling capital from lower-return properties into higher-return properties. While many analysts had a view back in October of what we would receive, my view was that a reasonable price would be in the $1.1 billion range. ", "So at a sales price of $900 million, it is roughly $200 million below my expectations. I believe the drop in the futures price for natural gas was a material factor in not meeting my original price expectation. However, in $900 million, the sales price is above our minimum, and the recycling effect is materially accretive to our NAV.", "We are familiar with the purchaser and are quite confident they will close. The purchaser has their financing lined up, and there is no financing out in the purchase and sale agreement. As mentioned previously, we anticipate the sale to close in late April. As a minor point, we retained two non-producing properties in the Barnett that we believe to have approximately $50 million of value. ", "Now turning to the financial impact, because of the executed the purchase sale agreement prior to filing our 10-K, we deemed it appropriate to mark the Barnett properties to market. As a result, we recognized a $463 million non-cash impairment in our year-end 2010 financial statements. ", "As I think about the impairment, it makes sense in that we invested all of our Barnett capital in a multiyear period when gas prices averaged roughly $8 per mcf. While accounting rules required that we record the impairment, we look at the sale more along the lines of a lifetime exchange, where we're exchanging Barnett properties for essentially Marcellus properties. The difference is that we're selling the Barnett properties at a single point in time, and we'll be reinvesting the proceeds over a one-and-a-half- to two-year period.", "From a tax perspective, we will recognize a gain of approximately $200 million which will be shielded by our $415 million NOL, so we will incur no cash taxes on the sale. ", "Looking at the sale, our Barnett production is currently running at $113 million a day. So we're selling the properties at approximately $8,000 per flowing mcfe. We're receiving over 8x annual cash flow. Based on recent transactions, these are very reasonable metrics. ", "I know some may compare our sale to the recent Chesapeake-announced Fayetteville sale. I think that the Chesapeake sale is a superior transaction based on the fact that they're receiving approximately $10,000 per flowing mcf. However, quite frankly, I think their properties, taken as a whole, are more attractive than ours. Their Fayetteville properties cover 487,000 net acres while our Barnett properties are 9x smaller, at 52,000 net acres. Also Chesapeake's Fayetteville acreage is much more blocked up than our Barnett acreage. Additionally, the Chesapeake-Fayetteville properties are producing 4x the volume as our properties and have 7.5x the number times more drilling locations than our properties.", "Although it's an asset deal, the purchaser of the Chesapeake properties appears to be paying a size and scale premium as well, which I think made the difference. Once we close the Barnett sale, we will lose approximately $113 million a day of production. ", "Based on our model, we expect that we'll fully replace the lost production by the end of the third quarter this year. This illustrates why we are convinced that selling the Barnett and recycling proceeds is the highest and best use. ", "Despite selling approximately 20% of our current production, we also anticipate generating double-digit year-over-year production growth for 2011 in the 10% range. As a point of reference, adjusting the Barnett sale, we anticipate the 2011 production would be more in the 25% range. ", "Let's now turn and take a look at the Barnett sale, how it sets us up for 2011 and beyond with regard to capital spending and capital funding. The Barnett sale will generate $900 million of proceeds. We also have identified $200 million to $250 million of additional asset sales we plan to complete in the next 12 months, primarily in 2011. These are small miscellaneous properties and acreage that are not strategic, and their disposition has already been taken into account with regards to impact on production, growth, et cetera. ", "We plan to spend $1.38 billion of capital expenditures for 2011. But at the end of 2011, we anticipate having approximately $400 million of excess proceeds to carry into 2012. Based on current futures prices for 2012, we currently estimate generating $850 million of cash flow. So when you combine that with the $400 million of carryover from 2011, we will have $1.25 billion.", "We currently anticipate that capital spending for 2012 will be equal to 2011. That will leave us approximately a $150 million gap for 2012, which can easily fund our new bank credit facility. ", "Looking still further ahead, based on current futures prices, we currently anticipate we can fund 2011 and 2013 capital spending fully with internally generated cash flow and no asset sale. This plan was based on natural gas futures prices of a couple weeks ago that averaged $4.50 for 2011, $5 for 2012 and $5.25 for 2013. ", "To connect more of the dots, as I mentioned, we anticipate that year-over-year production growth of 2011 will be 10% after deducting the production loss with the asset sales. I stated previously we anticipate the Marcellus production to grow from just over $200 million a day net at the end of 2010 to $400 million a day net at the end of 2011. ", "We expect 2012 company-wide production growth to be in the 25% to 30% range, and we anticipate the Marcellus production will exceed $600 million a day net by the end of 2012. From both 2011 and 2012, we currently anticipate find and development costs to be $1 per mcf or lower. I'll say that again, because it is a very important point when you think about how we get to positive cash flow. We anticipate find and development cost of 2011 and 2012 to be $1 or lower. I think that will be well below the industry average and probably the top in our industry. ", "This plan I just described is also balance-sheet friendly. At the end of 2012, we estimate that our debt-to-capital ratio will be lower and our debt per proved reserve will be materially lower than where we stand today. Clearly, what is driving these expected results is the Marcellus Shale play. As I noted above, we anticipate the Marcellus production actual rate will go from just over $200 million a day at year-end 2010 to over $600 million a day at the end of 2012.", "Currently, we have 790,000 net acres in the fairway of the Marcellus. Our current plan shows that we will alternately develop approximately 700,000 net acres. Some of our existing acres will likely be sold, traded, expire or may never be drilled to surface and other issues. In addition, we will spend capital dollars over the next several years renewing and extending leases. The resource potential numbers that we have published earlier this month are based on this plan and take into account the acreage numbers I just discussed.", "We also believe that approximately 60% of 700,000 net acres that we plan to develop for the Marcellus has potential for the Upper Devonian and Utica Shales. So by developing and holding the 700,000 net acres for the Marcellus, we are also capturing the Upper Devonian Utica resource potential. The size of Marcellus being one of the most economic plays in North America, we like it because it's really three plays in one. Because all the other share plays are essentially single-horizon plays versus the Marcellus, where we believe our acreage holds resource potential in the Upper Devonian and Utica as well as the Marcellus. We view the 700,000 net acres we plan to develop to be more like 1.5 million acres when you compare to the other plays. ", "A very significant advantage we will have in developing the Upper Devonian Utica will be that we will be drilling, where we've been drilling Marcellus Wells, we've already incurred the cost for acreage, roads, surface location, water management, gas lines and compression. Therefore, the incremental costs to develop the Upper Devonian Utica will be reduced by approximately 1/3 versus developing these zones on a stand-alone basis.  We believe this will allow us to continue to drive down the cost of the entire play. ", "Now this is a good segue into the whole cost structure issue. Our strategy is to consistently generate double-digit per-share growth at top-quartile or better cost structure. Over the past five years, Range has had one of the better cost structures in the industry. However, as natural gas prices rose significantly, 2006, '07 and '08 time period, so did our unit cost. Most of the industry sold their unit cost rising even faster than ours.", "As a result, our DD&A costs, which is a reflection of your aggregate F&D cost over time, rose to a high of $2.48 per mcfe. Likewise, our leased operating costs rose to a high of $1.05 per mcfe. By selling our higher-cost properties and reinvesting in our higher-return, lower-cost properties, we have driven down these costs.", "Our DD&A costs had decreased from the high of $2.48 to $1.85 in the fourth quarter of 2010, a 25% reduction. We expect DD&A to decline to $1.75 for 2011 and reach $1.65 for the fourth quarter in 2011. Generally, lease operating costs have decreased from a high of $1.05 per mcfe to $0.72 for 2010, a 31% reduction. We anticipate lease operating cost to continue to decline to $0.65 in 2011, reaching $0.60 by the fourth quarter of the year. ", "My current view is, to be consistently profitable in this business, your DD&A and lease operating costs combined need to be trending down to the $2 to $2.25 per mcfe range. We are clearly moving there, and I'm confident that our operating teams will get it there, and probably faster than I expect.", "With that, why don't I turn the call over to Roger, our CFO, to give you his thoughts and perspective?  Roger?", "Roger Manny", "Thank you, John. Normally, I lead with the income and expense items and close with the balance sheet liquidity update. However, since we only renew our bank credit facility every four years and there's so much more to the new credit facility than just the 2016 maturity date, I'll follow up John's comments with some additional color. Also to allow more time for questions, I'll be very brief in my income and expense commentary, focusing primarily upon trends and first quarter 2011 expense guidance. ", "The new Range bank group consists of 27 experienced oil and gas lending institutions, each of which employs one or more petroleum engineers to evaluate the borrowing base lending capacity of each company's proved reserves, and they do this twice a year. The bank engineers are deemed insiders, so they have complete access to all requested internal data as well as public data reported to the various regulatory agencies.", "The bank evaluate our cost figures, reserve replacement performance, the quality of our reserves field by field and, in many cases, well by well. Changes in the E&P company's bank borrowing facility can be an excellent barometer that signals changes in proved reserve quality, cost structure, capital productivity and overall business outlook. ", "Accordingly, we were keenly interested in the bank's determination of our pre- and post-Barnett sale borrowing base. See, we view the Barnett as one of our core properties, but the banks view it as some of their core collateral. So selling an asset this significant can be problematic for both lender and borrower as these opposing views must be reconciled.", "The fact that 100% of our existing banks plus one new bank committed to a 33% increase in our borrowing base, from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, without the Barnett asset is a significant ratification for the value and confidence they place upon the post-Barnett range. The credit facility was oversubscribed. We received $3.3 billion in commitments from the bank, even though the facility interest rate was reduced and covenant flexibility was increased. Needless to say, we're thrilled with the new credit facility and the positive story it tells. And with the Barnett proceeds reducing the outstanding loan balance to zero, Range will have $1.5 billion of committed liquidity under the facility throughout 2011. Many thanks to our bankers who may be listening to this call for their continued support. ", "Moving to the income statement. Cash flow for the fourth quarter was $159 million. This marks the second consecutive quarter of improving cash flow. Per-share cash flow for the quarter was $0.99, $0.02 above the analyst consensus estimate of $0.97. Cash flow for all of 2010 totaled $577 million, or $3.64 per fully diluted share. EBITDAX for the fourth quarter was higher than the previous four quarters, totaling $189 million. EBITDAX for the entire year was $694 million. ", "Fourth quarter cash margin was $3.06 per mcfe, that's up $0.06 from the prior quarter. Quarterly earnings calculated using analyst methodology for the fourth quarter, which excludes nonrecurring and noncash items, was $30.4 million, or $0.19 per fully diluted share. That's $0.05 higher than the analyst consensus estimate of $0.14. ", "Analyst earnings for the entire year were $89.3 million, or $0.56 a share. Please go to the Range Resources website for a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, including cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and analyst earnings.", "Turning to the cost structure for a minute. The most critical cost item was announced just last month:  our $0.71-per-mcfe all-in reserve replacement cost for 2011. The fourth quarter DD&A rate again declined to $1.85 per mcfe, just as one would expect with such significant capital productivity improvement. And that brings the DD&A rate down for all of 2010 by 14% from last year's $2.35 figure. Though the DD&A rate varies with production mix and is, therefore, challenging to predict, we anticipate the DD&A rate will decline further in 2011 to approximately $1.75. And, should our 2011 drilling results mirror those of 2010, the DD&A rate would decline to approximately $1.65 at year end.", "The Barnett assets clear all impairment tests under the successful efforts accounting method. However, with a signed purchase and sale agreement in hand, even though the transaction is not yet closed, we have impaired the Barnett property value to reflect the possibility of the sale. This noncash impairment is the economic equivalent of a full-cost ceiling test write-down. ", "Fourth quarter direct cash operating expense before noncash compensation but including workovers was $0.72 an mcfe. That's equal to the previous quarter and down $0.03 from last year. Now we anticipate cash direct operating expense in the first quarter of '11 to be approximately $0.69. That will decline further through 2011 to the low $0.60 range by the fourth quarter.", "It's interesting to note that although production was significantly higher in 2010 than 2009, total cash-direct operating expense for this year of $129.3 million was actually $1.3 million lower than last year. Production taxes for the fourth quarter were $0.17 an mcfe, and that's down 19% from the fourth quarter of last year. ", "As production taxes are a function of production mix and oil and gas wellhead prices, we do expect to drop another $0.01 per mcfe in the first quarter of 2011. ", "G&A expense adjusted for noncash stock comp and other non-recurring items was $0.57.  That's down $0.04 from last quarter. Now for the first quarter of 2011, we anticipate G&A expense to be in the $0.60 to $0.62 range. ", "Interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $0.73 per mcfe, and that's flat with the third quarter. Interest expense should decline slightly once the Barnett sale proceeds are applied to pay off the outstanding bank debt. Exploration expense for the fourth quarter of 2010 excluding noncash stock compensation expense was $15.8 million, and that's up slightly from prior quarters due to higher seismic expense.", "  ", "And with higher delay rentals and seismic expenditures budgeted for 2011, first quarter of 2011 should see expiration expense in the $22 million to $24 million range. ", "Moving to abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, this number for the fourth quarter was $23.5 million.  That's $3 million higher than last quarter but $5 million lower than the fourth quarter of last year. With the Barnett sale behind us, our steady-state 2011 quarterly unproved property impairment should run $15 million to $17 million. ", "Range ended 2010 with a $415 million NOL carryforward to help shield future taxable income. And as John mentioned, this tax shield will more than offset the approximate $200 million taxable gain from the Barnett sale plus the miscellaneous asset sales anticipated over the next 12 months. This will ensure that there will be no tax leakage in the cash sale proceeds. ", "Now from day one, it was decided that we would include a portion of our 2011 hedges with the Barnett sale, because to not do so would result to over 100% of our remaining production being hedged. The value of the hedges as of January 31 that are included in the sale total $42 million. Now post-Barnett sale, we expect to have approximately 80% from our 2011 gas production hedged with a floor price of $5.39 per MMBtu.", "So to summarize, we're ending 2010 with improving trends in reserves, production, cash flow and expense control. The new bank facility underscores these trends and, when combined with the proceeds from the Barnett sale, provides Range the strongest balance sheet and the most financial flexibility it has ever had. John?", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Roger. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff Ventura, our Chief Operating Officer, to give you his thoughts.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Thanks, John. I'll begin by discussing our year-end reserves. Range's 2010 reserve growth was the best in our history and, I believe, the best in our peer group. We grew reserves 42% to 4.4 Tcfe with all-in finding and development cost of $0.71 per mcfe. Our drill bit reserve replacement was 840% at a cost of $0.59 per mcfe. Reserves per share, debt-adjusted, grew 32%.  Proved developed producing reserves grew 25%. Importantly, this was accomplished despite removing 230 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves in our historical Pennsylvania tight gas sands in lower CBM locations. Although these reserves are still economic, given the great success we're having in the Marcellus and elsewhere, we do not plan to develop them within the next five years. It's ", "important to note that not only did our 42% growth overcome removing 230 Bcfe of historic tight gas sand in CBM locations, it also overcame selling 189 Bcfe of reserves.  Thus removing a total of 419 Bcfe and producing 181 Bcfe, we still grew 42%, and did so with peer-leading F&D.", "During 2010, we focused 81% of our capital on the Marcellus, and the results were excellent. Utilizing performance history from 139 Range horizontal wells, our average well was 5 Bcfe. At year end, our Marcellus PUD location to proved developed ratio was 1.9. This year, we will focus about 86% of our capital into Marcellus. ", "Given the large derisk acreage position we have in the play, 2011 should be an exceptional year. Despite our plans to sell the Barnett properties, we expect that we will achieve double-digit reserve growth in 2011, even without the Barnett properties. We should also achieve approximately 10% production growth. We believe we will overcome the lost production that is expected to go with the Barnett sale. ", "Current Barnett production is 113 million per day. We exited the Marcellus at a net rate of approximately 200 million per day last year, and we forecast that we will exit the Marcellus at a net rate of 400 million per day this year. ", "I believe we have adequate production capacity from the wells that we have drilled and will drill this year to achieve the 400 million per day. I also believe we have adequate processing and gathering capacity.  Let me take a few minutes to discuss processing and gathering capacity for 2011. ", "In Southwest Pennsylvania, we currently have processing capacity of 155 million per day at the Houston I and II plants. The Houston III plant is expected to come online in mid-April, and Range's capacity in that plant will be 165 million per day, which will make our total processing capacity at that site 320 million per day. ", "At the Majorsville I plant, Range's current processing capacity of 30 million per day, which should increase very shortly to about 45 million per day with some minor modifications that are currently under way. By mid-third quarter, the Majorsville II plant should be in service. This will increase Range's processing capacity at that site to 85 million per day. Therefore, our total processing capacity under contract with MarkWest is growing to 390 million per day. ", "In addition to our processing capacity in Southwest  Pennsylvania, our gathering capacity, at 375 million per day, will be expecting well ahead of our production volumes throughout the year. We are well-positioned to be able to move the gas from the wellhead to the processing plants. ", "In Lycoming County, our current gathering system capacity in Phase I is 50 million per day. The remainder of Phase I and II gathering systems are planned to be complete in the third quarter. And at that point in time, our gathering capacity will be 200 million per day in Lycoming County. ", "So in total, by the end of 2011, between Northeast and Southwest, our processing capacity for the wet gas is expected to be 390 million per day. And our gathering capacity, which is pipelines and compression, is expected to be more than 575 million per day. We have planned and should have in place processing and gathering in all areas to meet our need this year, with plans to stay well ahead of our production ramp over the next few years. ", "At this point, I'll turn the call back over to John, and I'll be happy to answer any of your operational questions in the Q&A.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Jeff. I'll now provide some more details for 2011. For the first quarter of 2011, looking for production to come in at 540 million to 550 million a day. The midpoint represents a 19% production growth versus the prior quarter, and, if successful, it will represent our 33rd consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. ", "Range, like many other companies, experienced material freeze-offs and shut-ins production in January and February. The weather impact as we currently know it has been reflected in this production guidance. ", "Assuming the Barnett sale closes at the end of April, our second quarter production will be lower than first quarter. Third quarter production should be back up close to the first quarter, and we anticipate fourth quarter production to be well-above 600 million a day. We anticipate unit cost to continue to decline in 2011 and refer you to the guidance that both Roger and I gave you previously. ", "Getting back to the capital budget, given the high degree of operational control, we can and will remain flexible as to the capital spending. As you recall, we underspent last year's budget by $100 million and still exceeded our production and reserve guidance.", "The good news is that at $4.50 flat NYMEX gas prices, our drilling projects in the Marcellus, where we are spending 86% of our capital budget, generate over a 50% rate of return. It's pretty amazing. ", "In summary, while the Barnett sale is a couple of hundred million dollars less than we anticipate, it is a significant catalyst for Range ramping up the funding for our Marcellus play, which, as I mentioned, has really robust returns. And it's also a catalyst for reaching a cash-flow-positive position in 2013.", "As outlined in our operations release that we released a week or so ago, our drilling program is off to a tremendous start, having recently drilled our best wells in the Marcellus and Nora/Huron, Mississippian Lime and the St. Louis plays. We are confident that we can once again deliver double-digit production growth in 2011 and are also confident that we can achieve this growth at a find and development cost of $1 or less. If we achieve our plan, it will be another value-creating year in 2011.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, why don't we open up the call for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "A couple of questions for you.  You described the Barnett sale as almost one of your like-kind exchanges and able to really focus your activities on the Marcellus. Of the 86% that's being spent on the Marcellus, can you give a breakdown of what you expect to spend in the Marcellus versus the Upper Devonian versus the Utica?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, let me take that question. Our focus is going to be almost all on the Marcellus. We're really encouraged by what we see in the Upper Devonian. We've drilled and completed a couple of wells. We're in the process of testing the second well. And the same with our first Utica well, which we disclosed this month also. So the first Upper Devonian with over 500 million per day and the first Utica 4 4 for a seven-day average. But this year, we're looking at, we'll probably drill on the order of, literally, just a couple wells in each this year to continue to look at the potential and derisk parts of our acreage. Our focus is going to be on driving up value in the Marcellus. That being said, I think you're going to see a lot more of our -- the other E&P companies in the area drilling wells through the Utica and through the Upper Devonian. So just like originally, it was Range alone leading the charge in the Marcellus and then several other companies coming in and help to de-risk our acreage. You're going to see the same thing I think happen with the Utica and Upper Devonian. And in the meantime, we're going to stay focused on driving up rates in the Marcellus.  Like John said, we entered this year at 200, and we're looking at exiting the year at about 400.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "And from the Southwest to Northeast with the gathering system in line, is the Northeast going to have a bit more capital allocated to it this year?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, it will be a bit more, but the bulk of our drilling is still going to be, by far and away, down in the Southwest and in the wet area.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "And lastly, on the production, you talked about the production ramp, John, the quarterly ramp including the impact of the sales. What was the split of gas versus NGLs on the Barnett sale? And as we look forward to that ramp, particularly as you get to the fourth quarter and into 2012, what should we expect your gas-versus-NGL component to be?", "John Pinkerton", "Rodney, do you want to take that?", "Rodney Waller", "We're running right now about 79% gas, and the Barnett was about 20% liquid. So we expect same kind of composition of 79% gas. The NGLs will be twice what the crude oil is as you model it forward. And then we can kind of give you guidance as we drill in the Southwest and the Northeast.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, I would just suggest any specific modeling questions that you have that you call Rodney and his team.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "Perfect.  And then lastly on the Mississippian, that's obviously become a pretty hot topic. You have in your last presentation about 15,000 acres in that play. Can you provide any additional color in terms of what your activity levels are in that area and whether or not you're still ramping activity? Because the talk has been that you all have had some pretty strong results in your early activity there?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, we've had good success. We announced a couple wells that tested, combined, 807 barrels of oil, 298 barrels NGLs, and 1.3 million per day. So we're 1,314 barrels per day combined, 657 barrels each. And when you look at the play, and we have it in the appendix that's out on our website, you're looking at really strong economics, cost of those is about $2.1 million to get about 300,000 barrels, 80-plus percent rate of return. So we have a good position. We've added to our acreage position, actually, we're a little over 20,000 acres now. So we have a good position. But like we said, for this year, 86% of our capital is going to be going into the Marcellus. And out on the website, I think, we have a book that breaks out the remainder of the capital in the other divisions. And you're looking at a relatively small allocation for the Midcontinent this year.  It will be 6% of our total budget. And the reason is a lot of our acreage there and in other areas is held by production. So we got a great position, a great team, and really, if you look at the Range wells, I think, they're some of the best wells in the play so far, if you look at not only IPs, but 30-day averages.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Biju Perincheril from Jefferies.", "Biju Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Could you talk to me about the well that you mentioned, the Marcellus well that you mentioned in the release last week and the 18 million a day?  Was that drilled with any -- was there any change in how you drilled and completed that well? Or was that result a function of location?", "John Pinkerton", "Yes, let me talk about that well. Rod mentioned the Mississippian. So let me just talk about some of our wells in general, maybe give you a little more color for the wells that were in the operations release a week ago. Let me start with that well. That well, that was a standard, basically 2,500-foot lateral, eight-stage frac, sort of a plain vanilla well. And really I think what speaks to it is the quality of acreage that we have there and also as we continue to go up the learning curve and how to drill and complete. When you look at that well, that was a really important well with a step-out well in a Southwest part of the play. It was 35 miles from our core area in Washington County. So that's a big distance away. The well tested 18.6 million per day on a five-day test. It may be our best well to date, or clearly it's one of our best wells to date, so we're really excited about that. When you look at that well, stepping out 35 miles plus some of our drillings plus the industry's drilling and you look at our position in the Southwest now, we estimate about 85% of our acreage in the Southwest has been derisked through our wells and others. So it's more than 800 wells that have derisked and defined that area. So we feel really good about that, and those are the economics that John mentioned. And again, look on our website and various analysts show that the rate of return when you're in the Southwest during the core part, like a lot of our acreages have, perhaps the best rate of return anywhere in any play in the U.S., or it's clearly in the very tippy top of it. So that was a really important well and a key well, and I would expect by the end of the year that we'll probably have derisked 100% of the acreage, in essence. When you move on to that release, we also talked about 11 horizontal wells we brought on in the Southwest part of the play in the fourth quarter. And in the release, it's said BUR [ph], we're expected to exceed 5 Bcfe. If you look at our reserve estimate today on those 11 wells, it actually look like they're going to exceed 6.5 Bcfe. So they look like they are really strong wells, for that, that's an 11-well average of those most recent wells. So very exciting again. Great rock, team's doing a great job. Midcontinent, I just mentioned to Ron, we're talking about the horizontal Mississippian wells, and I won't repeat that, but good economics, oil looked good. But I will mention an additional well that I want to talk about up in the Midcontinent division, and it's a horizontal St. Louis well. And I really want to give the team credit there. That's the industry's first successful horizontal St. Louis well. And going back to the release, it's IP-ed at 360 barrels of oil per day, 593 barrels NGLs, plus 13.8 million cubic feet of gas, or 903 barrels liquids and 13.8 million per day. After being online for three weeks, it's still producing 872 barrels, it averaged 872 barrels per day and 13 million barrel per day. So very, very low decline, very strong well. One of the best wells Range has ever drilled.  That well cost us about $4.5 million to drill and complete. Probably we'll recover on the order of 8.5 Bcfe. So just like Range pioneered the Marcellus in general, the first horizontal well in the Utica, first horizontal well in the Upper Devonian, it's the industry's first horizontal St. Louis well. So the technical teams are doing a great job and drilling some excellent wells really across our whole -- across the company. And the last one that I want to mention that was in the release is also a key well, it's in the Nora area. Now we mentioned the horizontal Huron Shale well, which drilled 25 miles away from our production in Nora. And that's really, again, a big step-out. But when you look at all the vertical well control that exists across that acreage block, and this is on the new acreage that we acquired, as John mentioned earlier, last year in Virginia. Given the vertical well control and looking at the wells in Big Sandy and the wells to the south in Nora, we stepped into what we thought was going to be a really good area 25 miles away. And the Huron there looks really good. It looks like it's probably better rock quality than Nora, plus it's all virgin pressure. So when you look at that IP, 2.6 million per day, and these are relatively shallow wells and relatively inexpensive. And most likely, it will add somewhere in the order of 400 to 500 Bcfe net, or derisked that amount of gas with that well.  Of course, that's all great news on the operations side.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Carver with Capital One Southcoast.", "Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.", "I have a couple questions.  One, on the St. Louis well, the horizontal well, how many locations do you think you have on your acreage? Do you have any sense of that yet?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, when you look at -- it's on the website and in the appendix. We actually have the locations that we have out there. And we think right now we've identified an additional 71 horizontal locations and six vertical. Plus we've identified other areas where we think that's perspective that we'll attempt to lease and pick up.", "Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.", "And what would your working interest be there, or was that a net number?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "No, that was 100%.  On the first well, our working interest was about 50%.", "Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.", "So that was 71 gross or net locations on that?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Those are 71 gross locations. Our working interest on average, we'll probably have to get you, it's probably better than that on average, because a lot of it is 100% when we drilled the first well, it was -- we drilled the less risky well on in place where we had a partner carry or take part of the cost. So we have, on average, the working interest is higher.  We can get you that number and we'll give it to Rodney.", "Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.", "A couple more questions.  On the $200 million to $250 million in additional sales, how much production is associated with that? I know your production guidance is net of the sales number, but I wanted to get a feel for how much production you're planning on selling and whether that was oil or gas.", "John Pinkerton", "Yes, Marshall, this is John. It's a combination, quite frankly, of a lot of the little property, some in Texas, some in Mississippi, Louisiana and some kind of some scattered acreage that we own. So it's really not all that much production associated with that. Because honestly, I don't have that number in front of me, but it's relatively immaterial.", "Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.", "You gave your gas price forecast with your cash flow assumptions and balance sheet assumptions for the next couple of years. What were your NGL assumptions that you used in terms of NGL pricing for this year and next year?", "John Pinkerton", "Well, first of all, that wasn't really my, or Range's, or John Pinkerton's, or Jeff Ventura's, or anybody's. It was really just the future strip price that we could have locked it in on when we did the runs back in, I think it was mid-February, a week or two ago. So it's really that price. I'll let you all determine what you think gas price is going to be in the future, you probably have as good, if not better, idea than I do. In terms of the liquids and the oil, we base that off $80 oil and then we base the liquids off that as a percentage just using historical references.  Fundamentally $80 oil.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen from Tudor, Pickering.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "John and Jeff, just given your successful testing of multiple new areas in Texas and Oklahoma this year and what you've had, what's your success case CapEx for those areas in 2012?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, for 2012, we are going to stay really disciplined. We're going to stay focused on the Marcellus.  Really what we're doing is spending enough money to derisk and understand the play. So the plans John laid out, I mean, there's an allocation of capital for those areas. But the good news is the bulk of all those areas are held by production, so we can really control the timing and such.", "John Pinkerton", "We're spending $1 billion, $1.38 billion, we said the same, but I would round it to, let's say, $1.4 billion. And I think we'll spend probably again, we'll spend 80% to 85% of our dough in the Marcellus with the idea that, that is the one area where we don't have most of the acreage held by production. And so that's one of the primary reasons we want to sell the Barnett, is to term out all those leases. We're about 46% held by production in the Marcellus, and based on the plan that I gave you, we will hold 700,000 acres through the plan. And again, that's what the resource potential numbers are based on and everything else. So it all kind of ties together in terms of method to the madness.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "So then if you think about the focus on the Marcellus as you think about improving efficiency, improving plant capacity and as your cash flows grow and you have the debt capacity, I'm trying to understand why you wouldn't then accelerate into an improving efficiency in the Marcellus. Where are the governors there?  As you get the cash flow growth, it seems like your CapEx could go up with it.", "John Pinkerton", "Well, hopefully, what we can do is spend more for less or keep it the same and get more out of it. And quite frankly, that's what happened this year and that's what happened last year, and that's what we're expecting for 2011 and a little bit of 2012 as we move forward. But again, I want to walk the walk before I talk the talk. So as we see those improving metrics, we'll deliver them to you. I mean I think in the overall sense, we've delivered pretty fantastic reserve growth at really low numbers. And I think if we can do $1 or less find and development costs for this year and next year, you're going to see our DD&A rate continue to go down. You're going to see our LOE rate continue to go down over time. And I think that's really the proof in the pudding, and it's interesting. I looked at what you all put out in terms of the four key criteria, which was make money in the current environment. And we really think that's important, too, is to be able to make money in a $4.50 or $5 environment. And that's where I get back to this whole thing where I think your DD&A rate and your LOE need to be about $2 to $2.25. So I think we're getting there.  Your second point was focus on costs, we're really, I think more than anybody else, we're cost-focused. And then third, obviously, invest in the highest-return projects. I mean simply, and I've got a lot of questions today on the Barnett and have had over the last month, it's really simple to me, we've got drilling locations in the Marcellus that at $4.50 gas generate over a 50% return. Those same drilling locations in the Barnett are high teens, 20-type-percent rates of return. So the question is pretty easy for me.  Not being the brightest bulb in the package, I'd rather spend the money in the Marcellus and the Barnett. So that's why I sold the Barnett.  Pretty simple. And then your fourth point, and this is why I really agree with you guys, is driving up production and reserves on a debt-adjusted, per-share basis. As we've said on and on again, what we think really drives value in this business is per-share growth, debt-adjusted at low cost. And if you can do that consistently over time, you'll make your shareholders a lot of money. So we're all in, in terms of those four metrics. And hopefully, we'll continue to do that. It's a big challenge, but we'll see. And I think, Dave, to get to really what you're getting at, do we think our cost will improve, do we think our efficiencies will improve?  Yes. I really think they will. I think we've got really good people. We've got over 325 people now in Pittsburgh running that program. So I think we'll get better at it. But as we do, we'll tell you about it.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Effectively, what I heard is you've got an acceleration an efficiency gain built into your expectations, but it isn't necessarily reflected in your production numbers at this point.", "John Pinkerton", "Absolutely.  That's a great way to characterize it.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "And then, as I think about each of those other areas where you're just spending that 14% of your capital, how do those get sold? It seems like they're just naturally lined up for recapitalizing and selling small amounts of acreage production and the like.  I mean, what's the time frame to appraise this?", "John Pinkerton", "Well, like what Jeff said, the good news is almost all of that is held by production. So there's really no -- we don't have a gun to our head in terms of having to develop it. I know it's hard for some of our listeners to really imagine, but in 2013, once we get to positive cash flow, when you look at '14 and '15, at least our numbers suggest we're going to be throwing off a whole lot of cash flow.  So we're going to need projects like the Cana, projects like the St. Louis, projects like the Mississippi and Lime, some of the other projects we're doing out in the Permian. We're going to need those projects to continue to fuel our growth. That being said, I do think over time, just like anybody does, if somebody comes and makes us a great offer for one of these projects and we think it's NAV accretive, we'll take a hard look at it. So we try to be flexible, we do try to keep in terms of how we run our business -- fundamentally, it's really easy. Jeff and I and Roger really view our jobs as we allocate capital, and as we see it, we try to allocate capital to the highest-return projects each and every day. We still sign every AFE in this company over $200,000, all three of us still sign it. So we've got our hands firmly on the steering wheel. We think we've got a very good view on what drives value, and we got some really, really good people that are drilling some really, really good wells. And at the end of the day, we think that will all wash out, and we'll have top quartile performance.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Just one final question.  As you think about management compensation, you've tied management compensation to debt-adjusted growth rates and efficiency. Do you adjust your debt-adjusted growth rates in the baseline whenever you sell assets?  Or do they remain in that base and then is it off an annualized number?", "John Pinkerton", "What we do -- our compensation committee looks at our budget and our projection for the year, and that's the baseline. And to the extent that if we sell something after that baseline has been developed, then we have to live with that. But again, that's part of it, and we'll have to live with it. But as I tell all the management, that's life in the big city at Range.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Lamont [ph] with Simmons and Company.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just thinking a little more specifically about the Marcellus acceleration. What level of rig activity are you guys planning in 2012 to get to the 25% to 30% growth? And can you give me the split between Southwest and Northeast?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, if you look at 2012, we're looking at a total of 17 rigs. And then you have to add the Talisman  too, though. See, there's 17 Range-operated rigs. We will have 12 in the Southwest and five in the Northeast, and then two that get add the Talisman piece, the Bradford County stuff.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And your total in '11 is what?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Total in '11, we expect to end the year in '11 at 14 plus Talisman. So currently, we are at 13, we'll end this year at 14. We'll end '12 at 17. Talisman is currently at two. We expect them to end the year at four, and they should have four in 2012.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Can you give us an update on current well costs in the Marcellus, what your expectations are throughout the year and then kind of what's baked into your CapEx?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, we can talk about that. When you look at, we really have three types of wells. And let me talk about them conceptually and I'll give some more specific numbers. You've got development wells in the Southwest part of the play.  Then you've got step-out wells in the Southwest, and then you got wells in the Northeast. And then eventually, you'll role into that same category there. When you look at a development well, a pad well in the Southwest, we're approaching $4 million, like we said, in the development mode. Current AFEs are actually $4.2 million, so we're getting pretty close. And then when you step out, like I said I mentioned a well earlier that's made just over 18 million a day, 35-mile step-out. When you step out, those wells are going to be a lot more expensive. One, you've got -- instead of allocating the pad over multiple wells, it's on one well. When you drill step-out wells, you typically, you may cork part of the well, run a bunch of micro-seismic, run a bunch of experiments and all those kinds of things. Plus you aren't allocating the water impoundments [ph] and rows and stuff across multiple wells, either. So those are two kinds of wells. Then when you go to the Northeast in Lycoming County, the wells are roughly 2,000 feet deeper. So when you look at current drilling, we're looking at, for this year in the Marcellus, we're looking at 195 wells, roughly.  That's our expectation of that. 172 would be in the Southwest, 23 in the Northeast. If you look at the average of the 4.2 plus the higher-cost step-out wells and delineation plus some science, those wells are going to average on the order of 4.4 million probably per well in the Southwest. And you could add roughly 1 million for the wells in the Northeast. And I expect with time, literally, again, if you go back and look at what we have, 85% of that acreage in the Southwest has been derisked, so when you look at our acreage position, you use 80-acre spacing there and you use -- and just assume 80% of the acreage is drilled, that's over 4,600 wells in the Southwest. I guarantee you, with the technical team we have, when you let them drill year in and year out over, literally, thousands of wells, I have high hopes that those guys are really going to drive those costs down dramatically from not only where we are today or our expectation, of course [ph] they'll break through that. Sort of what John was saying earlier, there will be a lot of capital efficiency gains that will come with time, and I believe the same thing will happen up in the Northeast also.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, I appreciate the color.  And lastly, just can you give us an update on your acreage swaps, how much of those are ongoing? Do you continue to expect to do them in 2011?", "John Pinkerton", "What has gone on in the industry up there is that all, I think most of the companies that come to the conclusion that the key to life is blocking up your acreage, because you can gain -- that's where you gain these efficiencies. If you have to drag rigs all over creation up there and then your pipelines, and your gathering, your water, impoundments and your water gathering it really drives up your cost. So I think most people, like us, and you learn it just by doing it, you learn that if you can covey up part of your acreage together, you really drive down those costs. So I think that's -- the good news is we've had a number of discussions and continue with the industry participants up there. And we actually see the attitude for doing acreage swaps actually increasing dramatically. We've had a number of meetings with companies that heretofore weren't too keen on it, but I think has realized what the potential is, that it's really good for both sides. And the good news now is that some of these other companies, I think, quite frankly, the reason they didn't do it is because they probably, to some degree, viewed that we had a technical competitive advantage. So they were a little bit fearful. I think now, they drill the number of wells, their own technical teams have confidence in what they're doing. So it's really just trying to swap acreage, in most cases, like-kind for like-kind, but even when they're pretty far away I think there's a pretty good reasonable expectations in terms of quality of the acreage. So the ability to use that as currency, both from an add-to perspective and then have a technical understanding of it, I think has gone up dramatically. So we've had a number of conversations with companies, and we probably got four or five trades anywhere from 500 acres up to 50,000 acres, a number of trades that we're working on at any one point in time. And so again, I think those will happen. The smaller ones will just happen in normal course.  If we do some bigger ones like the ones we've done before, we'll make note of that in the conference call. But the good news is I think the industry as a whole has figured all this stuff out, and so now, there's a lot, I think, bigger desire among the companies to do it. In particular, I'll say, in particular with some of the bigger companies up there that might have bought out some of the smaller operators, they're big believers in that, and they don't have near the emotion that some of the smaller companies had in terms of their acreage. So that, again, will help facilitate acreage trades as we move forward. The other thing, if I can just segue into how that affects your acreage, is that in any big giant play like this, and Barnett's the same way, is that you're always going to have acreage that you have to renew and extend.  No matter, really, no matter how mature the play is, there's always going to be some amount of acreage you've got to renew and extend. And as companies block up their acreage, you can, your ability to renew and extend within your little corral within your neighborhood goes up over time, because other companies then focus on their acreage and are less focused on trying to come into your areas and poach, if you want to use that word. So I think that's happening as well, and we're able to renew and extend a bunch of the leases that we're doing for this year, because we have leases that are expiring throughout the year.  But most of the stuff that we need to renew for this year, we've already done so. But even looking at 2012, the cost to do that is really pretty modest.  And to give you an idea, we still have less than $1,000 per acre on average cost into all of our Marcellus acreage. So even if we had to renew it all at something that was 2x or 3x what we recently paid for it, you can still see that the overall cost of that acreage is going to be really, really reasonable compared to some of the other plays that we've been in and some of the other shale plays that have kind of taken off and gotten real hot. So again, I think all that matters when you're looking at these plays and thinking about the economics and what really -- what makes sense in terms of economics.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Scialla with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Question on the southwest part of the Marcellus play. Jeff, those 11 wells you talked about that you think now are exceeding an EUR of 6.5 Bcf. I'm trying to get a sense for if you think that's a good average going forward. So can you talk about where those were drilled, were they in one concentrated area or were they scattered across your acreage? And then it looks to me like you booked about 4 Bcf a well in the southwest part of the play. I want to know if that's right. And then how do those numbers reconcile?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Those wells, some of them are off the same pad and some of them were scattered. And I think it's a reflection of the quality of the acreage. So those wells -- those 11 wells look like they're better than 6.5 Bcf. Our best well, just to remind people, is probably about 10 Bcf. So there's definitely high-quality Wells on our acreage and around our acreage. So I feel good about that. I think what we like to do, and Alan Farquharson that runs that effort for us, we book reserves, and then we like to just watch performance with time. And to the extent we see those wells year after year coming up, you'll see those increases in there. And that's the way we'll march forward. Actually, again, referring you to our most recent IR presentation, it's on the website. Rodney's looking for it. There's actually a graph that shows every single horizontal well we've drilled with time in the form of a zero-time plot. So you can see the performance coming up with time. And it's on Page 18 of the current IR presentation you can see on the website. Yes, you're right. I mean with booked, when we book some of those puds and stuff, they're booked at a lower number. I expect with time as we continue to drill them, and I'm hopeful, that we'll continue to see that positive increase that we are seeing.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "That's fair.  Did you do anything differently? It sounds like you're leading us down the road that 5 Bcf is probably not going to be the last of those curves on that Page 18, that there's another step up to be anticipated down the road.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "I think there's two things to look at. One, can the guys do things to improve performance to them. I'm really convinced in time, we'll do things to drive down cost.  And at the end of the day, it's really about rate of return and repeatability. Again, we've got at 80-acre spacing, using 80% of the acreage, 4,600 wells to drill. And when you look on that same presentation on the website, you can see what our current rate of return is for those wells and we did it fully loaded as well, taking all the lands and the corporate G&A and putting it all on an individual well. That's on Page 15. So we've got strong rate of returns, even if we don't change what we currently have, at $4 gas, the 5-Bcfe well currently is 74%, fully loaded is 58%. I believe our team is going to do better than that with time, but those are pretty strong economics.  Plus, medium to long term, personally, I think gas prices are going to be better than $4. You go to $5, you're approaching 100% rate of return.", "John Pinkerton", "This is John. I think just to be completely transparent, there are some people who view the Marcellus as a mature play. In some respects, it's still, compared to the other plays out there historically, it's still -- you'd have to put it in the relatively new category. There's really very few wells with over three years' worth of production. I think most of them, or nearly all of them, are our wells. So with all that being said, these 11 wells are pretty exciting. And I think we got a really good team that's executing, but 11 points is not what I'd call a huge statistical sample. So I think what we're telling you is that we're off to a great start for 2011. We drilled some really good wells. Stay tuned. We'll keep you up to date. We'll continue to post on that chart every single well we drill and do that zero-time plot. So we'll all get to see it realtime, and then we can, over time, we can look at it and see whether this ought to be 5 Bcf, 5.5 Bcf, 6 Bcf, 6.25 Bcf, 7 Bcf, I don't know where it's going to end. And the other thing about it is...", "Jeffrey Ventura", "But again, I'd re-emphasize, if it ends where it is today, it's pretty darn good. And according to some people, right where it is today, it's the best play out there, including some of the oil plays.", "John Pinkerton", "I agree. So at the end of the day, we're in great shape. We'll be as transparent as we possibly can in terms of laying those things out for you and letting you all decide whether you think they're going to end up -- we got a view, but I think it's important, we're going to be -- we're going to keep it the Range way. We're going to start out, and like Jeff said, Alan Farquharson, who runs our reserves, is a very talented guy. And one of my views in life is, you want to have modest, upward performance revisions every year. I don't like it when we have negative performance revisions. Doesn't make me feel good. So we're going to take that position, and it's something that's just built into our culture and our DNA.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I want to ask one quick one on the Upper Devonian.  It seems like you may be a little bit more optimistic on that than Utica at this point. One, I wanted to see if that is a fair statement.  Then secondly, I know the Upper Devonian is pretty widespread in Appalachia. That 10 Bcf to 14 Bcf of potential you talked about in that formation, do you think you've identified an area where the Upper Devonian is different geologically than most the rest of the basin? Or should we -- could you extrapolate those kind of numbers to a broader area?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "On the Upper Devonian, I'd characterize it this way.  The Upper Devonian -- the Marcellus is a Devonian-age shale, and it's at the base of the section. So when we drill to the Marcellus, you drill through the Upper Devonian. So we've got over 200, between the vertical Wells and horizontal Wells, over 200 of our own control points plus a lot of other control points in the basin. So we've got good data, pretty good data, in terms of well logs and gas shows and that type of information in the Upper Devonian. The neat part is our first well in the seven-day test made over 5 million per day. And now, we frac the second one and we're flowing it back. And then if you look at the Utica, the Utica's 2,000, 2,500 feet deeper than the Marcellus. And very few wells in the basin go to the Utica. So by definition, the Upper Devonian is lower-risk, there's a lot more control, a lot more data than in Utica.  Plus, it's somewhat of an advantage in that it's shallower. So the wells are going to be less expensive. The other thing you mentioned -- so I feel -- so from that perspective, you have to feel better about, on a risk basis, at this point in time, the Upper Devonian. But it's early, and I'm sure there's going to be a number of Utica wells drilled this year by others plus the couple of wells we may drill. The other thing, we've mapped all these plays all over the entire basin.  When you look at the Upper Devonian and the section we're talking about, it does not cover the entire basin. It's more specific, we feel, based on our mapping, sort of towards the southwest part of the play is primarily where it covers. So you don't have, when you look at all the things that you need for shale play, and you look at the gas shows and you look at the logs, primarily that's where we think it's perspective. We've mapped it. We've looked at -- we've mapped gas in place. We've applied reasonable recovery factors. Those are the reserve numbers that we came out with -- or our resource potential numbers that we came out with earlier this year. So that's what it\u2019s based on, but it does not cover a widespread area. And relative to the basin it's unique more to the southwest part of Pennsylvania -- southwest, west part of Pennsylvania.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I guess just one quick follow-up on that, too, is that well you said you had, it looked like it was overpressured.  Do you expect that for most of your acreage in the Upper Devonian?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, for the acreage and where we feel with perspective, the answer would be yes.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit from BMO Capital Markets.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Recognizing it's not core to the Range story, but can you revisit the horizontal Huron shale well, specifically the depth and pressure as well as how the success rate of 2.6 million a day, I believe, compares to others, either horizontal or vertical wells and what this means for an EUR? And whether or not that rate is repeatable, or is it all about finding the virgin pressure?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, when you look at that, the Nora area is an important part of our company, it's a stacked-pay area, a lot of hydrocarbon in place specifically in terms of the Huron shale. There's been great success with EQT on the Kentucky side. And we, Range, led the way on the Virginia side, I believe, drilled the first horizontal Huron shale in Virginia. And all of our Wells have been in and around Nora. We picked up the acreage last year.  North of there are extension properties that we acquired for $130 million. And we were pretty excited about it because, one, it's very sparsely drilled, but it's in the center of a giant gas field which ranges all the way from Virginia and Kentucky on up into West Virginia. But when you look at the acreage we picked up, it was very lightly drilled. But there were penetrations that went through the Huron Shales, we knew the Huron Shale had gas in it and had good thickness and all those characteristics. But what you never know until you drill it is sort of rock quality. So we drilled our first horizontal well in there, and the wells are roughly 5,000 feet deep, plus or minus. And we got a well at 2.6 million per day. That a typical Nora well probably on average is a little under $2 million per day, maybe around $1.8 million. Our better ones, take the high-end ones, they were up in that range. But most of them on average are probably 500,000 a day or 700,000 a day less than that. Those wells look like they'll make on the order of Bcf cost somewhere around 1.2 million to drill and complete. And so what's exciting is we have good control. We got good thickness. The rock quality up there looks a little better. It's more fractured, maybe more like Big Sandy is in Kentucky, the difference being that we're at virgin pressure because it's never been developed, where Big Sandy was developed back in 1920s, 30s, 40s and up until present day. So you have -- pressures there are a lot lower. So it's an important well and, like I said, it could add resource potential 400 to 500 Bcf net to us. Again, we're only a 4.4 Tcf company at year end. So that's a big number. And I think those numbers will grow with time.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then turning to the Marcellus for two more questions here. If by the end of this year, 46% of your acreage will be held by production, what does that mean? What is that number at year end next year?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, currently we're at about 46%. I'd say, around the middle of next year, the number will, by the end of next year, will approach 60%. And literally, within a year or two after that, we'll be up into the 80% range. Remembering the number's probably never going to be at 100%, because it's a great play, and you're going to be picking up leases and renewing and trading.  So we're well on our way to drilling and holding what we believe, like John said, will be 700,000 acres. And the important part again with the acres is what's perspective for us in the Marcellus also captures the upside and resource potential that we laid out for the Upper Devonian.  We'll capture all of that and then whatever there is in the Utica blow. So far, we are encouraged there's gas down there for sure.  And the other thing with the Upper Devonian, before I leave it -- I'm trying to give you a little color. The neat part about our position in the Marcellus -- not only do we have great acreage position, a large position with high quality, a big part of it is in the wet gas area, which clearly helps with today's economics. The Upper Devonian is going to be like the Marcellus, The wet dry line will be like the Marcellus. So where our acreage is wet in the Marcellus, most likely the Upper Devonian will be like that. So you get the liquids uplift as well. But let me put that in perspective, if you look at -- and this is out on Slide 19, you'll see it in the book, we're seeing the resource potential just in the Southwest and the Marcellus, 15 to 23 Tcfe. If you break that down, that's 13.5 to 20 Tcf of gas and 307 to 463 million barrels of liquids. So that's really like a giant oil field right there.  And then you can add the Upper Devonian and liquids to that on top of it.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I understand, and one last one, if I could.  Forgive me if this question has already been answered.  Given the gross proceeds from the Barnett shale asset divestiture, where does this leave us with respect to a JV? How does that rank now? Or is that no longer relevant? That is, a JV on the Marcellus Shale acreage?", "John Pinkerton", "Well, I think the Barnett sale tells you a couple things. One, we felt like selling the Barnett was much more accretive than doing a JV in the Marcellus. And I think that's pretty easy math, and I think it's pretty easy to understand that. Now what we try to do is connect the dots and show you that at least we believe that we can be cash-flow positive by 2013. And I didn't mention the word JV in any of those discussions. So again, what the Barnett sale does, it gives us a rock-solid balance sheet, irrespective of where gas prices ago, whether they go to $0.50 or $10. And it allows us to really ramp forward the Marcellus at a much faster pace than we went last year. And we're going to go from $200 million a day to $400 million to $600 million, that's about as the fastest ramp-up as one could imagine in these plays on a relative basis. So it allows us to ramp up, but really what it does, what it also does, is allows us, at least we believe, if we stay disciplined, to be cash-flow positive by 2013 and retain 100% of the resource potential from the Marcellus, the Upper Devonian and the Utica for Range's existing shareholders. I'm in the business, I'm an existing shareholder. I still think I'm the largest individual shareholder. Where I'm really focused and anchored is I want my existing shareholders to get as much of the resource potential you possibly can out of this Marcellus. And I'm telling you, it's a world-class field.  We've got the tiger by the tail. The good news is I think we've got a plan, and I think hopefully that we connected the dots. And therefore, you're going to see how we we're going to get there. And if we are, we're going to -- like Jeff has said, we got a feel here that we think ultimately we'll get to 2 Bcf or 3 Bcf a day net to our interest. That will be huge, and our shareholders are going to make a whole bunch of dough from that, including yours truly, including all of our employees that have a lot of stock as well. So it's really trying to retain as much of the upside as possible for our existing shareholders. Does that mean we'll never do a JV? I'm never going to say that, because if somebody comes in and offers us a number that blows us away, we'll do it if it's in our shareholders' best interest. And again, it's really simple at Range. Double-digit per-share growth on a debt-adjusted basis at low cost. And what's going to drive that is putting our money in the highest-rate-of-return project that on a risk-adjusted basis we feel like has the highest rates of return. We're not interested -- a lot of other companies would have kept the Barnett. Would've put just enough money in to keep it flat and then taken their money and gone to do something else with it. I'm not saying that's a bad strategy, but I think if you really focus on per-share growth, what you ought to be doing is taking your dough and putting it in the highest-rate-of-return projects.  And what drove us to the Barnett sale is, is that the Marcellus returns for each drilling locations are 3x to 4x better than what's in the Barnett. To us it was just easy math. And on the other side of it, it does put more pressure on our technical and operating teams.  They need to be right. They have to perform. But I got to tell you, at $0.71, $0.59 drill bit mining cost and better than $1 the next couple of years, I got to tell you I think that's world-class performance. And because we've got a world-class team in the world and we got really good rock. So that's what gave us the confidence along with the Mississippian well, the St. Louis well, the Huron well. It's those results that gave us the confidence to go ahead and sell 20% of our production. 12%, 25% of our production, that's pretty -- not a lot of companies do that. It's a very bold step, a very bold message to our shareholders that we really, really believe what we're doing here and we're absolutely convinced that this is the right thing to do and we're going to get there. There's no doubt in our mind we're going to get there. Now, what are gas prices going to be? I don't know. But again, the good thing is if gas prices really tank, I'm really glad we sold the Barnett. If gas prices go up, I'll be a little bit -- that we probably left a little money on the table. But where it gets us in terms of being able to ramp up and hold that 700,000 acres. There's just no comparison that it was the right thing to do.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have run out of time for questions. I'd like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments.", "John Pinkerton", "Well, on behalf of -- this is John Pinkerton. On behalf of the Range management team, Board of Directors and employees, we really appreciate you all being on the call today. We had, at least in our view, a very, very solid and value-creating 2010. ", "We are pleased as punch to have the Barnett sale inked up where we could connect the dots for everybody, because I know I get that question -- that's the question I get from all the shareholders, and I really appreciate that. ", "Hopefully, we've done a good job of connecting the dots. I know there were a number of callers that didn't get their questions answered, or if we need to connect a few more dots for you, feel free to call any of us, including Rodney and his top-notch IR team, and we'll try to do that. ", "At the end of the day, regardless how you feel about the Barnett sale, we think it does two things. One, it allows us to ramp up development in the Marcellus in a big way. And two, it allows us to be cash-flow positive by 2013, which is just right down the road here. And we think those are two huge catalysts for our company, and really exciting catalysts. ", "And then, obviously, to the extent that the other plays that Jeff talked about continue to fruition and some of the other things we're working on, I think the future for Range and shareholders is really bright, and we look forward to a terrific 2011. We are off to a terrific start, and we'll look forward to giving you another update in April when we have the first quarter results. So with that, we'll sign off.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney Waller", "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon and welcome. Range reported results in the first quarter of 2011 with record production and improvement in unit cost. The first quarter marked our 33rd consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. Range has a very large inventory and base of reserves that will continue to drive our growth in production in reserves.", "At Range, we are focused on growth at low cost on a per share basis, to maximize shareholder value. I think you'll hear those same things reiterated from each of our speakers today.", "On the call with me are John Pinkerton, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Ventura, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Before turning the call over to John, I'd like to cover a few administrative items. First, we did file our 10-Q with the SEC this morning. It is now available on the home page of our website, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today. The tables are also posted in the website that will give you detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter, including our new NGL hedges.", "Second, we'll be participating in several conferences in May. Check our website for a complete listing in the next several months. Our Annual Stockholders Meeting is being held in Fort Worth on May 18. We hope that each stockholders received their proxy materials, and we urge each stockholder to vote for the proposals being submitted by the proxy.", "Now let me turn it over to John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Rodney. Before Roger reviews our first quarter financial results, I will do some of the key accomplishments we put together in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, first quarter production rose 17%, reaching the midpoint of our guidance. And also, production on a per share basis also rose 17%. ", "As Rodney mentioned, this is the 33rd consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. If you adjust for the asset sales, first quarter 2011 production growth would have been over 20%.", "Our drilling program is on schedule throughout the quarter as we drilled 63 wells. We had 100% success rate. We continue to be extremely pleased with the drilling results, despite the low natural gas prices. We're generating some very attractive returns from the projects where we're spending our money. We currently have 20 rigs in operation.", "The 17% increase in production was partially offset by a 2% decrease in realized prices. As a result, first quarter oil and gas revenues were up 15% compared to the prior year period. Cash flow was also up 11% compared to last year.", "On the cost side, we're most -- we were pretty pleased. In particular, we saw a 10% decrease in our 5 largest cost categories combined. The only disappointment was that direct operating cost came in at $0.75 per Mcfe, $0.02 higher than last year. This was due to the extremely cold weather that we incurred throughout the first quarter and primarily February, and also due to some higher water handling cost in the Marcellus Shale.", "With regards to our Marcellus Shale play, we made a significant headway in the quarter as we continue to drill just some fantastic wells. We continue to fill in our acreage position and build out the -- our pipeline processing infrastructure.", "In addition, we continue to hire some really high quality people that work on our Marcellus team in Pittsburgh now or at Southpointe, we now have over 300 people working on the Marcellus. And we're very excited to see that team.", "Lastly, we've completed the due diligence phase of the Barnett sale, and we're just a few days away from closing the sale. All in all, I'm very pleased with how much we accomplished in the first quarter. I complement the entire Range team for a job well done.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Manny to review our financial results. Roger?", "Roger Manny", "Thank you, John. The first quarter was a busy period for the accounting and finance team, as we closed the new bank credit facility, supported the Barnett sale process and reclassified our current and historical results for the Barnett sale assets as discontinued operations. We expect to soon file an 8-K that effectively amends our 2010 Form 10-K to reflect the Barnett assets as discontinued operations. ", "But the last time we worked through discontinued operations accounting, was following the offshore Gulf of Mexico sale back in early 2007. I remember that reclassifying our historical financial statements, reflecting discontinued operations, was a source of confusion as investors attempted to reconcile year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter performance when our historical results have been changed due to the asset sale. For this reason, the financial results I'll be presenting on the call will include the historical results of the Barnett assets, including the first quarter of 2011. And these will match the supplemental non-GAAP figures in the press release. There are tables included in the press release and posted on our website that reconcile the discontinued operations results that appear in our 10-Q to the continuing operations results.", "Now starting with the income statement. Oil and gas revenue, including cash-settled derivatives, was $268 million for the first quarter, 15% higher than 2010. Cash flow for the first quarter was $163 million, 11% higher than last year and higher than the fourth quarter of last year. In fact, this was the third consecutive quarter of improving cash flow. Per share cash flow for the quarter was $1.02 even with the analyst consensus estimate. ", "First quarter EBITDAX was $198 million, 12% higher than last year, and like cash flow, the third consecutive quarter of improvement. Cash margin for the first quarter was $3.29 in Mcfe, up $0.23 from the fourth quarter of last year, but down $0.20 from last year's first quarter due mostly to lower price realizations and to a lesser extent, higher operating costs.", "Quarterly earnings, calculated using analyst methodology for the first quarter, which excludes certain nonrecurring and noncash items, was $35.2 million or $0.22 per fully diluted share. That's $0.03 higher than the analyst consensus estimate of $0.19. As Rodney mentioned earlier, I'd like you to reference to Range Resources' website for any questions concerning the reconciliation of these non-GAAP figures, including cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and analysts earnings.", "Looking at the cost structure this quarter, we saw another significant drop in our DD&A rate from $2.12 per Mcfe the first quarter of last year to $1.65 per Mcfe in the first quarter of this year. We anticipate the DD&A rate for continuing operations in the second quarter will be approximately $1.84 per Mcfe. Now this projected $0.19 increase in the DD&A rate next quarter is not a step back in our drive for greater corporate -- capital productivity, but it's due to one of the peculiarities of asset sale accounting. Now when an asset is held for sale as a discontinued operation at fair value, that asset is no longer depreciated or depleted. And in the case of the Barnett, the assets were deemed held for sale at the end of February. So in accordance with accounting rules, there was no Barnett depletion book for the month of March, even though we recorded production from the assets. ", "The mathematical result of this accounting treatment is a peculiar nonrecurring reduction in the DD&A rate. Now we look forward to continued progress driving down this noncash expense the rest of the year. And we predict that by year end, the DD&A rate really will be $1.65 per Mcfe, unaided by asset sale accounting treatment.", "As John mentioned, direct cash operating expense before noncash comp, but including workovers for the first quarter, was $0.75 per Mcfe. That's up $0.02 from last year and up $0.03 from last quarter. Part of the reason for exceeding the expense guidance on this item was reduced production from cold weather. For example, if you're running a compressor and that compressor is not running due to a frozen wellhead, unit cost will suffer. And we also saw increases in water handling expense up in the Marcellus and increased expense at various nonoperated well operations. ", "Direct operating expense declined each month during the quarter. So while the total was higher than expected, we remain encouraged by the trend toward lower costs. Now listeners may anticipate cash direct operating expense in the second quarter to be approximately $0.71 to $0.73. We still believe we can push this cost down to below $0.60 range by the end of the fourth quarter. ", "Production taxes for the first quarter were $0.16 in Mcfe. That's down $0.01 from last quarter and down $0.03 from the first quarter of 2010. Production taxes are expected to drop another $0.01 in the second quarter.", "G&A expense, adjusted for non-cash stock comp and other nonrecurring items, was $0.55, down $0.02 from last quarter, but up $0.06 from the first quarter of last year, due to higher legal fees and higher public relations expense. We performed favorable to guidance on this cost item during the first quarter, and that offset higher-than-anticipated direct operating cost. ", "Now for the second quarter of 2011, our estimate is that G&A expense will be in the $0.56 to $0.59 range.", "First quarter interest expense was $0.73 in Mcfe. That's flat for the previous 2 quarters. Interest expense should decline slightly this year, once the Barnett sale proceeds are applied to pay off the outstanding bank debt. But once quarterly production volumes reflect the Barnett sale, interest unit costs are expected to be up $0.01 next quarter, but declining later by year end.", "Now exploration expense for the first quarter of 2011, excluding noncash stock comp was $26 million. That's up considerably from prior quarters, due to higher seismic expense, and to a lesser extent, higher delay rental expense. Seismic spending is always somewhat sporadic, but based on our budget for this year, we continue to estimate total exploration expense at approximately $25 million to $26 million per quarter in 2011.", "Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties for the first quarter was $16.5 million. That's down significantly from last quarter and spot on with last quarter's expense guidance. Acreage value estimates can change unpredictably, but the rest of 2011 should see improved impairment running $15 million to $18 million a quarter.", "As our capital spending currently exceeds cash flow, Range continues to generate excess intangible drilling cost productions for tax purposes. Now we expect to actually end the year with a larger NOL carryforward than we entered due to IDCs generated by our drilling program. So there'll be no tax leakage of the Barnett sale proceeds and no significant remuneration, if at all, of our NOL.", "Range has continued to add to its hedge position, with 80% of our total 2011 gas production hedged at a floor price of $5.40 MMBtu following the Barnett sale. For 2012, we have approximately 190 million cubic feet a day, hedged at a floor price of $5.32. And in 2013, we now have 100 million cubic feet per day hedged with collars at $5.00 by $5.73 per MMBtu. We've also hedged a portion of our 2011 and 2012 liquids production, with 7,000 barrels per day hedged in the third and fourth quarter of 2011 at $104.17 per barrel. And we have 5,000 barrels per day of 2012 liquids hedged and $102.59 per barrel.", "Now please see the hedging tables attached to the press release and a more detailed tables on the website, if you need some additional hedging information.", "In summary, the first quarter of 2011 brought continued increases in production and cash flow with reductions in our aggregate cost structure. And the path is cleared for the Barnett sale later this week, and we look forward to the balance sheet improvement and future funding certainly that, that sale will provide. ", "John, back to you.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Roger. Now let's turn the call over to Jeff Ventura to review our operations. Jeff?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Thanks, John. This year, we will focus about 86% of our capital in the Marcellus Shale. Given the large de-risked acreage position we have on the play, 2011 should be an exceptional year. Even with the Barnett sale, we still expect that we'll achieve double-digit reserves growth in 2011. ", "We anticipate achieving 10% production growth. We believe we will overcome the production sold in the Barnett sale. Barnett production is approximately 110 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We exited the Marcellus at a net rate of approximately 200 million per day last year. And we are on target to exit the Marcellus at a net rate of 400 million equivalent per day this year. Currently, we have 9 drilling rigs in the southwest portion of the play and 4 in the northeast part of the play.", "I believe we'll have sufficient production capacity from the wells we have drilled and will drill this year to achieve our targeted goal of 400 million cubic feet per day net. I also believe we have adequate processing and gathering capacity. Let me take a few minutes to discuss processing and gathering capacity for 2011.", "In Southwest Pennsylvania, we currently have processing capacity of 170 million cubic feet per day at the Houston 1 and 2 plants. The Houston 3 plant is expected to come online tomorrow, and Range's capacity on that plant will be 165 million per day, which will increase our total processing capacity at that site to 335 million cubic feet per day. At the Majorsville 1 plant, Range's current processing capacity is 30 million per day. By mid-third quarter, the Majorsville 2 plant is planned to be in service. Once online, this will increase Range's processing capacity at that site to 70 million per day. Therefore, our total processing capacity under contract with MarkWest is growing to 390 million per day.", "In addition to our processing capacity in Southwest Pennsylvania, our gathering capacity is 375 million per day and is planned to be expanding well ahead of production volumes throughout the year. We are well positioned to be able to move the gas from the wellhead to the processing plant. ", "In Lycoming County, our current gathering system capacity in Phase 1 is 50 million per day. The remainder of Phase 1 and Phase 2 gathering systems are planned to be completed in the third quarter. And at that point in time, our gathering capacity will be 200 million per day in Lycoming County.", "So in total, by year end 2011, between the northeast and southwest, our processing capacity for the wet gas is expected to be 390 million per day. And our gathering capacity, which is pipelines and compression, is expected to be more than 575 million per day. We have planned, and should have in place, processing and gathering in all areas to meet our needs this year, with plans to stay well ahead of our projected production ramp over the next few years.", "In Southwest Pennsylvania, Range's gas flow for 2011 is covered by firm pipeline capacity or long-term sales contracts with primary capacity holders. In Northeast Pennsylvania, Range's gas flow for 2011 is covered by long-term sales to customers who have firm capacity on the Transco Leidy line. Except for force majeure event or unexpected pipeline maintenance, we have the proper downstream capacity into our sales in place to move our production to market in 2011 and 2012.", "Range has also entered into 2 MOUs with ethane consumers, with the intent to negotiate long-term arrangements to sell ethane into the marketplace. We are staying focused on the Marcellus Shale, and are on target to meet our goal there of driving up production to 400 million per day with one of the best cost structures and one of the best rate of return plays. ", "We continue to see great wellresults in the Marcellus. During the quarter, we brought online 15 new wells in the liquids-rich portion of the Marcellus, with an average initial production rate of 10.1 million cubic feet per day equivalent, which consists of 7.4 million per day of natural gas and 452 barrels of NGLs and condensate per day.", "Our plan for 2011 is to drill moderate lateral lengths, fewer wells per pad and retain our acreage in this prolific play, for not only the Marcellus potential, but also for the Upper Devonian and Utica Shale. ", "However, we'll continue to undertake some interesting tests this year. The tests consist of different step-bound [ph] drilling, targeting and/or new completion approaches in multiple areas this year. The first is in the Upper Devonian shale. We brought online in the first quarter our first 2 Upper Devonian Shale wells. The first well, which was previously announced, had an IP of 5.1 million per day and was a dry gas well. The second well came online under constrained conditions at a rate of 2.5 million per day, which is comprised of 1.9 million cubic feet of gas and 91 barrels of liquids. The decline rate of the second well is significantly flatter than the first well, and the second well has a higher EUR than the first well.", "For our first 2 horizontal wells in the Upper Devonian Shale, we're encouraged about the results and the potential it has for unlocking the Upper Devonian Shale resource potential. The combined IPs of the first 2 Upper Devonian wells average 3.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day net. ", "To provide perspective in the Marcellus Shale, we did not see an IP of 3.8 million per day until we completed our seventh horizontal well. Reserves for the first 2 Upper Devonian Shale wells look like they're in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 Bcfe per well. This is significantly ahead of where we were in the Marcellus at this point in time. ", "Overall, the gas in place per section is similar to the Marcellus. Key future wells will focus on determining the optimum place to land the laterals within the section, optimum lateral length and number of stages. We plan 2 to 4 additional Upper Devonian tests this year. Importantly, like the Marcellus, a significant portion of the Upper Devonian Shale potential on our acreage should be wet gas.", "Of course, we have tremendous upside, not only in the Upper Devonian Shale, but also in the Utica Shale in Pennsylvania. Our next horizontal Utica well will be late this year, followed by a third well early next year. However, I expect multiple wells in both of these plays from others in the industry to continue prove up our acreage.", "Next is the liquids-rich portion of the Marcellus. Our average wells in the wet portion in the play make about 5 Bcfe, which is comprised of 3.6 Bcf of gas and 239,000 barrels of liquids, mostly with 8-stage fracs. We recently tested a 3,500-foot effective lateral, with a 12-stage frac in one of our wettest areas. And to date, it looks like the well will produce 6.7 Bcfe, which is split between 4.1 Bcf of gas and 425,000 barrels of liquids. We plan to go back into the liquids-rich area with new wells and test additional longer laterals, pump more stages per lateral and try to achieve higher conductivities in the fractures. Given the huge acreage position we have on the liquids-rich portion of the play, this could be very impactful. We'll also look at the effect of adding more stages and drilling longer laterals on a few of our wells in Lycoming County.", "In short, some part of the Marcellus play, that's wet -- some portions of the Marcellus play, that's wet versus dry, maybe more efficiently developed in slightly different ways. The tests we're doing for the purpose of finding the optimal rate of return for our entire Marcellus program and to improve Range's cash flow.", "In addition to the 790,000 net acres we had at the beginning of the year in the Marcellus Fairway, we have about 285,000 net held by production acres in Northwest Pennsylvania. The Marcellus in Northwest Pennsylvania is about 4,000 to 4,500 feet deep, more similar to the Fayetteville in terms of depth and pressure, however, within the wet portion of the Marcellus. Given the huge HBP position here and potentially significant impact, we'll drill the horizontal Marcellus well in that area this summer.", "Turning to the mid-continent. The horizontal Mississippi in play in Northern Oklahoma continues to show promise. Of our first 5 wells completed in the play, 30-day rates have averaged 340 barrels of oil equivalent per day with peak rates averaging 550 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes 1 short lateral drilled early in the program. The first well of a 4-well program in 2011 has been turned to sales at early rates of 380 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the well restricted due to pipeline capacity issues. Plans are now underway to improve take-away capacity in the area. ", "In addition, 2 wells are undergoing completion, while the fourth well has commenced drilling. Our play area continues to expand with over 28,400 net acres and potential for over 140 horizontal wells. We currently are estimating unrisked reserve potential of 300,000 to 500,000 barrels per well. ", "Up in the Texas Panhandle, we had excellent success with our first horizontal St. Louis well. It came online at 13.8 million cubic feet of gas per day and 903 barrels of liquids or about 19.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day. After producing for about 3 months, it is still making 13 million cubic feet of gas per day and 900 barrels of liquids. Payout was within weeks. We'll be drilling 3 additional horizontal St. Louis wells this year. ", "At this point, I'll turn the call back over to John. I will be happy to answer your questions in the Q&A.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Jeff. Great update. Looking to the remainder of 2011, we see continued strong operating results. For the second quarter 2011, we're looking for production to average 500 million to 505 million per day. Factored into the second quarter production guidance is the Barnett sale, which we anticipate will close in a few days.", "So we'll have the Barnett production of approximately 1 month in the second quarter. The Barnett, as Jeff mentioned, is currently producing approximately 110 million a day. When you average the loss of 110 million a day for 2 months in the second quarter, it equates to losing 73 million a day over the entire quarter on average. Assuming we hit the mid-range of our guidance for the second quarter, it will represent a 7% year-over-year increase. The 7% increase does not adjust for the Barnett sale. If you adjust for the Barnett sale, the year-over-year growth would be 22%.", "We are looking to make up about 1/2 of the sold Barnett production by the end of the second quarter, and the other half by the end of the third quarter. For the entire year, we still expect to achieve 10% production growth despite the Barnett sale. We expect to exit 2011 with the Marcellus Shale at 400 million a day and with total company production exiting the year at over 600 million a day.", "Now that we're nearing the closing of the Barnett property sale, I'll take a moment to look at the impact of our divestiture program. Including the Barnett sale, our divestiture efforts have yielded nearly $2 billion in sales proceeds. It has also reduced our well count by over 6,000 wells. This represents roughly 60% of our original well count. The properties that were sold were our more mature higher cost properties. The good news is that we are selling our more mature properties -- that while we were selling our more mature properties, we were focusing our capital on higher return projects.", "Despite the asset sale, our production reserves have consistently increased during this period. As a result, Range is now a much more efficient company. We are doing more with less. By less, I mean less wells, lower find and development costs, lower operating cost, et cetera. The first quarter results reflect the lower cost. Over the medium to long term, this will have a significant impact on our per share value.", "This is critical to generating attractive returns in a low gas price environment as well. In addition, by having fewer wells and properties and a more compact asset base, we can better focus our technical team on higher return projects and making those projects even better. ", "Lastly, one of Range's hallmarks is to keep things simple. By having fewer wells and properties, Range is a simpler company, allowing the Range team to focus more on efforts of driving up reserves and production on a per share basis.", "Turning to the Barnett sale, as mentioned previously, we anticipate closing the sale in a few days. This is a hugely important event for our company. First, the sales proceed will be more than sufficient to retire all of our outstanding bank debt, with excess proceeds available to help fund our 2011 capital program. As a result, Range will have, by far, the strongest balance sheet in its history.", "Second, the sales proceeds generated by the sale will be a catalyst for Range in becoming internally funded by 2013. Between now and then, we know exactly how we're going to fund our growth. Importantly, our shareholders, you now know specifically how we're going to fund our future growth. Having a strong balance sheet and knowing how we're going to fund our growth, puts us in a position of strength.", "We can now focus all of our energy on executing our business plan by driving up production reserves on a per share basis at a top quartile cost structure. The driver of this growth is our drilling inventory, which I believe is exceptional. We have the drilling projects in place that at low commodity prices, generate outstanding rates of return. As Jeff mentioned, our operating teams are continuing to enhance and improve our well results, while maintaining our stellar safety record.", "While I'm clearly biased, I am convinced we have an exceptional asset base and drilling inventory, as well as an exceptional team of people driving our performance. Our management team is keenly focused on enhancing our asset base and improving our team's performance. Selling our Barnett properties was somewhat of a bold move as the Barnett properties currently comprise about 20% of our production. After careful studying deliberation, we were convinced that it best served our strategy of growth at low cost. Most importantly, we believe it best served Range's shareholders, as it provides a clear path for capital funding and allows Range's existing shareholders to retain 100% of our 35 to 52 Tcf of current resource potential.", "From an investor's point of view, I believe Range is somewhat of a unique proposition. Because of our high-quality drilling inventory and low cost structure, we can generate attractive returns at today's low natural gas prices. This provides substantial downside protection. On the other hand, because of the extraordinary resource potential of the Marcellus Shale and our other projects, we have one of the largest per share upside of any company in our peer group. With the capital funding issue being clarified by the Barnett sale, we're extremely excited and motivated. We appreciate the support and confidence that our shareholders are showing us, and we look forward to the remainder of 2011.", "With that, operator, why don't we turn the call open to questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Our first question is from David Heikkinen with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "John, given you expect to be free cash positive in 2013, can you walk us through 2 things? First, your capital budget, expectations for '12 and '13? And second, what your commodity price expectations are for that plan?", "John Pinkerton", "The price expectations, we were using roughly $4.50 NYMEX for 2011, $5 for -- I mean $4.50 for 2011, $5 for 2012 and $5.25 for 2013. In terms of capital budgets, the next year's budget will be similar to this year. And in 2013, we'll probably spend a couple of hundred million more than what we're spending for the next -- for '11 and '12. And there's some things baked into it, obviously, into those capital budgets. We expect to become more efficient in terms of some of our drilling. We'll be able to spend more on drilling as time goes by versus on things that are nondrilling expenditures. The other thing is as we build out the infrastructure and as you move through 2011, '12 and '13, a great -- a number of wells we're drilling this year won't get hooked up until next year. But as we get bigger and the pipelines get big -- become more -- we get more outreach of our pipeline system, we'll be able to connect more wells faster. So you'll see some production growth, more efficiency in terms of that than you're seeing, let's say, for the past 2 or 3 years. So all that's kind of baked in there. We've done a lot of work on it, and we're pretty confident that we can make all that work.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Just thinking about activity level. So you've got CapEx flat as rig count goes up by roughly 4 rigs. Is that all efficiency? Do you expect capital cost to come in as you go into development mode and get more concentrated? Can you, Jeff, maybe walk through some specifics around well cost or something along those lines?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "We think well cost will come down with time. As we get -- we've got -- we're a little over a couple of hundred wells into the program of what could be, 5,000 to 10,000 wells. As we continue to drill wells, and it becomes more and more manufacturing, I think it's not unreasonable to think that within time, if we keep the same design, that we may be able to knock maybe $500,000 a well off. It may take us 2 or 3 years to get there, but we can move towards that as we get more into that mode. Of course, the other thing we'll do is continue to look at how to optimize completions and rate of return. And there's a variety of things. It may be that we tweak lateral length, stages, where we land them and all those things, it could lead to efficiencies. If we go -- it may be that if we stick with the same design, $500,000 per well comes off. Or it could mean with a more optimum design, it costs a little more, but the rate of return is higher, and we're more capital efficient. Either way, I think we'll get better with time.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "And then just one specific question on your NGL hedges, you locked in C5+. Can you talk about realizations or expectations -- or realizations of production volumes for the C4- side that you haven't hedged?", "Roger Manny", "Well we believe that the C5 is a good proxy for the C2s and lighters. So what we'll simply do is we're hedging that into a very liquid market, but we will modify the amount that we hedged to account for the difference and a dollar change in those commodity prices as we go forward.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "So out of your total NGL barrel, how much is C5+ and how isn't then? Just trying to get the split.", "Roger Manny", "Well if you look at -- if you look at the slide in the flip book on 33 for the Marcellus, your C5s are going to run about 6% of that barrel. And it will be a little bit less than that in the midcontinent area. But if you look at the correlation, David, those C5s and C4s all correlate within $0.50 of each other.", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "I'm still thinking that normal kind of 50-ish percent of total PI on everything else on the blend.", "Roger Manny", "I'm sorry, I didn't hear the...", "David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Your Page 33 still is guiding to a 51% of WTI realization, you just locked in the C5+?", "Roger Manny", "That's right.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Kistler with Simmons & Company.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company", "Real quickly following up on the CapEx before we get to '12 and '13. Looking at '11, Drillbit was $267 million this quarter with a target of about 1.38 for the year. Can you walk us through the ramp up? I think it's significantly heavier in 3Q and 4Q, but if you could just help us through that, that would be great.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "I mean when you look at production, it's clearly going to follow that way in completions. But it's definitely going to be a little more weighted towards the third and fourth quarters.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company", "Can you give us a breakdown of how that -- in terms of percentage wise, we should be modeling that out?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "We can -- maybe what we can do, the best thing is to talk to Rodney and Laith and David and they can just give you a little more granularity. We don't have that right in front of us, but they can give it to you after the call.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company", "No problem. And then speaking a little bit to the wells that were drilled and waiting on completion or tie in, there were about 51 this quarter on a gross basis. When we start thinking about that and comparing it to previous quarters or kind of what target rates are going forward, could you give some sort of sequential comparison so we know what you're going to be anticipating to flow through over time?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Part of the issue there is we're doing drilling now up in the northeast and in the southwest. To give you a little clarity there, once we get Phase -- the rest of Phase 1 on and Phase 2, we're looking at bringing 29 wells online towards the end of the third quarter in Lycoming County and additional 11 in the fourth quarter. So what is that -- 40 of those wells are going to be skewed towards the late third quarter and fourth quarter. So we feel comfortable. We entered the year at about 200 million per day net. We'll exit the year at about 400 million per day net. But it's going to be skewed towards the third and fourth quarters.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company", "And what should we anticipate is just sort of a typical backlog that you'd have of drilled uncompleted wells? Just so we get a sense of what's being held up by infrastructure or just service constraints at this point?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, in terms of service constraints, there isn't. Because what we tend to do is lock in. We have our rigs locked in, we have frac crews locked in. We're not waiting for a frac crew to pop open from another company in order to complete our wells. What you do have a little bit though, is like I said you have the -- we're waiting on phase -- the rest of Phase 1 and Phase 2 in Lycoming County and there's different events that I mentioned in terms of Majorsville and Houston 3 and all those different things coming on. We have a number of wells waiting on completion, and that should get better with time as we continue to build out infrastructure. Like John said, ultimately, once we plan, we delineate and have what we have. I have all that stuff in place. It'll come down. In terms of real specific guidance, I don't have that in front of me. That's another thing we can look at with time. But that's why we're trying -- rather than trying to give you rigs and when they come on, we're trying to give you the rigs that we currently have and what the rigs look like going forward in terms of the Marcellus. But we're also trying to give you the exact -- we're giving you production guidance for this year at 10%, next year at 25% to 30%. Exit this year or -- enter this year at 200 in the Marcellus, exit the year at 400, exit 2012 at 600. So we're giving you the production numbers that go with it. I think that's a lot simpler thing to do rather than you guys trying to time when the wells are going to come on. And I think if you follow the guidance, it's a better way to do it.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company", "I appreciate that clarification. And then as we just jump over to one last thing, the ethylene agreements that you or John mentioned on the call in the ops update, can you give us any kind of color on size of those, timing? Because obviously, those will kind of add a different hedge in place at some point.", "Rodney Waller", "We're under confidentially agreements. And I think Dow has given you more information than what we were allowed to give earlier until you get to these long-term agreements in place. We have 2 Memorandums of Understanding that will be going to 2 different directions, regionally. We have more proposals than we think that we could actually satisfy with us and the other producers there. But that will just simply come out over time. But once we have the fractionator in place in late 2011, then we'll be able to get our extractions as to where we want them. All the ethylene and the ethane production is going to be governed by, probably, a Sunoco line going to Sarnia. And the producer, the petrochemical companies in Ontario will have to retrofit. So that will probably be third or fourth quarter of 2012 at the earliest that we can actually start production.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company", "That clarification is very helpful, Rodney. I appreciate it.", "John Pinkerton", "And David, in terms of some of those detailed questions in terms of wells and things [ph], just holler at Rodney, and he'll be able to put some clarity around those for you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Gil Yang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "A couple of questions. Just to be clear, John, your comment that you'll be internally funded by 2013. So that sort of eliminates the need in your view with those assumptions for any equity going forward. Is that fair?", "John Pinkerton", "Gil, as you know, our view on equity has been and will continue to be for years and years and years is that we will issue equity if we have a clear use of proceeds. And that is still our view of equity. Right now, there is clearly not a clear use of proceeds. And we try to make that perfectly clear that with the Barnett, we don't have the need. But I'm not going to promise you that we'll never issue equity again. There's certainly opportunities out there that we look at from time to time. And to the extent that we choose to seize on one of those opportunities and believe it's clearly accretive on a per share value, then we'll try to seize that opportunity. And if that generates a clear use of proceeds, then we will issue equity. That being said, obviously, from our perspective, it's pretty clear to us what we need to be working on. We've got a huge opportunity in the Marcellus and in some of the other projects like Jeff talked about in terms of some of the things that we're doing up in the Texas Panhandle, in Mississippian Lime project, up in Northern Oklahoma and some of the projects we have in the Permian, we got a huge opportunity base. And so we'll continue to do that. We do also have a scout team that's out looking at other opportunities. And there's some exciting things that we're looking at. Nothing, I think, that's on the horizon that would qualify us to rush out and do anything. But again, I think the key, and I said and I'll say it again, is I think the Barnett sale does a number things. But it really puts us in the position of strength, and that we don't have to do anything in terms of that or equity in terms of the pace we're on. Again, that being said, if there's an opportunity presents itself that we think is in our shareholders' best interest, what you pay us to do is to seize that opportunity, and we'll be disciplined in terms of the balance sheet, how we raise to the extent that we issue equities. So still, same game plan, same theories, same strategy, nothing's changed in terms of that.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks for that complete answer. In terms of the commodity price forecast for that, do you assume any ability for you to strategically lock in, let's say, $5.25 over the next -- going forward, beginning 2013, do you assume any ability to lock in hedges at a slight premium to that price?", "John Pinkerton", "Absolutely, absolutely.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So that's sort of built into your expectation of cash flow?", "John Pinkerton", "No. It's not built into our expectations, I sure as hell hope it happens though.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Just to be clear, and it's on our website, the numbers John gave you for gas price, I think it was the February 3 script, and that's what that's based on. That's the point in time that we put that slide out.", "John Pinkerton", "And let me tell you at least the way I look at it and I think we look at it, is that to the extent -- we got now, we'll have in a week or so, we'll have a balance sheet where we got a bunch of cash. And we have nothing outstanding on the $1.5 billion credit facility where we have the borrowing capacity to take that up to $2 billion if we choose to. And our friends at the banks, I think, are perfectly happy to do that assuming we pay them the appropriate fees. We've got enormous liquidity. So really, the lever here -- the leverage here is that to the extent the prices move up and we can lock them in, and we will do that. You've seen with the, quite frankly, with the little issue in Japan, we saw gas prices move up in '12 and '13. We took advantage of that and locked in some '13 gas, I think, at pretty good prices. So we'll be very opportunistic there. So to the extent that we can lock those in, that's great and everything else. But at the end of the day, if gas prices move down a little bit, we've got this balance sheet and this credit facility that we can draw down on to the extent that we need it. So again, I think, it puts us in a position of strength. We got a great balance sheet. Like Roger always says, we've worked really hard and he's done a fantastic job of being CFO of creating this really strong balance sheet. And to the extent that -- there's no use in creating it if you're never going to use it. So to the extent that we need to use it, if gas prices are a little lower than we need, then we'll take advantage of it. To the extent that it's not, then we'll be able to obviously increase our capital a little bit more or do some other things with it that we didn't anticipate either. So it gives us lots of leverage that we can pull. But I think, the thing that's important for the shareholders is that to the extent, and I obviously talk and Jeff and I and Roger, Rodney and the rest, we talked to a lot of shareholders and I think one of the things that's really important is it puts real clarity into between now and 2013. And it really focuses us, the management, to really just get after it, drill the wells, get them on, focus, focus, focus, be disciplined, disciplined and just continue to drive it up. As Jeff said, we're looking at 25% to 30% growth next year, given what we're doing. And our team is doing a great job. And so, I think they'll hit the ball out of the park and if they do, we'll hopefully exceed those numbers and proverbially kick some butt. So again, it just puts us in a position of strength. And I think it's really important, and it gives clarity to all the shareholders. I think that's other important thing.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mike Scialla with Stifel Nicholas.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So you've talked in the past about drilling 2,500-foot, 3,000-foot laterals with 8-frac stages, which is not optimal but that's the recipe you're going to use to hold acreage. And, Jeff, you talked about the results you got from this 3,500-foot lateral with 12 fracs. I'm just wondering, is there any thoughts of doing a pilot where you try to get more aggressive and really optimize good development to just see what that might look like. Would that change your plans going forward or is that not a concern right now?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, let me take -- I'm going to take some time to answer that question. It's a good question. First of all, what we're doing this year, like I said is we're going to drill in that, call it, 2,500-foot, 2,700-foot usable lateral with roughly 8 stages for almost all of our wells. And what we know is, to date, the average of 139 wells primarily in all that are in production in the southwest part of the play, the average of all of them, the good, the bad and the ugly is 5 Bcfe. So in the development mode, that design well cost about $4 million. And today, we're not far from that. We're $4.1 million, $4.2 million, so we're very close to it. So spending, with that design, spending $4 million to get 5 Bcfe under -- and strip pricing right now, I think the 10-year strip is somewhere $5 to $5.50. But if you take a $5 flat gas price forever at 5 Bcfe, that's a 99% rate of return. So that may or may not be optimal, but it's pretty darn good. So we're happy with that, and we know if we stay today, keep that same design and go to fewer wells per pad. We can drill more wells, we can hold more acreage and still generate really strong rates of return. That being said, we've also done a number of experiments in the past, and we'll continue to do some going forward. And that's everything from longer laterals and more stages to where we land the well, we think is really important whether you're high, low or in the middle of the section. And that varies depending on where you are in the play, even where you are within a county, we believe. So there's a lot of different things that go into optimally developing it. And plus at this point in time in the play, early on when we started, back to Range pioneering the play and carrying 100% of the science, we're not doing that anymore. And early on, it was very competitive and for different reasons, companies didn't share a lot of information as everybody was building their acreage position. At this point in time, I think companies are more cooperative than they were competitive. So not only that Range doing experiments but we have other companies out there that are drilling laterals up to 9,000 feet and put a bunch of stages in them. So we can learn not only from our wells but from other people, and we'll look at optimizing going forward. So where we are today is we think we've got, like John said, one of the best plays out there, even at $4 flat gas forever, it's a 74% rate of return. At $5, it's 99% and it can go beyond. So we'll look at, can we get better than where we are today? And I believe we can. The way to get better by drilling and completing the wells better, which I think will happen or we're going to drive the cost down. Either of those are really significant upsides for the play. The other thing that I think is important to look at is, not only does it vary, Northeast, Southwest, or vary within a county, I think, whether you're wet or dry is important too. If you look at the liquids-rich part, which we really dominate and have the tremendous position in, and like I said, the wells are, that 5 Bcfe is 3.6 feet of gas and 239,000 barrels of liquids. We did experiment in one of the wetter areas and we've got a lot of wet area to continue to drill in. And it so happens that, that one well that had a 3,500-foot lateral and a 12-stage frac made 6.7 Bcfe, which is up 4.1 Bs and 425,000 barrels of liquids. So that's a big increase going from 239,000 to 425,000, maybe by more optimally landing it or completing it or some of those things that I've said we're going to test, maybe we can turn that into 500,000 barrels a well with gas, with the associated gas. So that would really drive economics and it really drive rate of return particularly where oil prices are relative to gas prices. If you look at our potential, John talked about, in aggregate, we have 35 to 52 Tcf of upside. We're a 4.1 Tcf company. Out of that, 20 to 31 Ts is in the Marcellus and 15 to 23 Tcf of that is in the Southwest part of the play. But again, if you break it down, you're looking at 13.5 to 20.5 Tcf of gas, that's 307 million to 463 million barrels of liquids, net to Range. In my mind, if you look at our performance year after year after year, and we put all of our horizontal wells in there in terms of 0 time plots, you can see the performance climbing with time. So I would expect the performance could continue to climb with time as we get better and better about what we're doing. So it's not unreasonable to think we'll reach the high end of those reserves, which is a 20.5 Ts just in the Southwest with 463 million barrels of liquids. The other key part of that is that's leaving all the ethane and the gas. Once we start extracting ethane, it's going to double our liquid yields. So the 463 million barrels becomes 926 million barrels net the range. And then, if we can get better about where we land and how we drill and complete, really, you're approaching 1 billion barrels of liquids, net to Range. So we think it's really exciting upside. We've got a dominant position in it and a great team working on it. That was a really long answer. But I think it's important to look at, I think, where we were, where we are today and where we might be going in the future.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I appreciate that. I wanted to ask you too on the Upper Devonian. Did I hear you right, you said the gas in place is similar to the Marcellus?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes. If you think -- and predominantly, we think the Upper Devonian is most perspective in that west to really the southwest part of the play. It doesn't exist over all the areas. But it does stack in the southwest part of the play. If in a particular area, gas in place is 100 Bcf per section, in the Marcellus, the gas in place in the Upper Devonian in aggregate would be 100 Bcf. So it about doubles what you have in that area.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And how is the rock quality between the 2 compare?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "It's really early. I mean, and that's something we need to look at and that's why I try to put in perspective, after a couple of wells in the Marcellus, where were we? After a couple of wells in the Upper Devonian, where were we? We need more data. But the neat part is we know we have hydrocarbon. We know we have wet gas. We know it can produce commercial rates even after our first 2 tries. It's highly unlikely that we landed it right in the optimal intervals on our first 2 tries. I can give you examples in the Marcellus, we're right next to each other, and it's easy to take our first few tries in the Marcellus. We're in a particularly, we landed our first well low in the section, the second one in the middle and the third one is the top. Progressively, as we got higher, the wells got higher. I mean, it went from 20 Mcf a day to about 1 million. And then we just moved it a little bit above the section and got 36. And now in that same area, we're getting 10 to 15, our best well was 26 million per day. And that's just moving where you land the well in the section and has nothing to do with lateral length or frac stages. So I think the same thing will be true of Upper Devonian. Understanding the rock and the quality of the rock and how to optimally land it that's really important but we're off to a better start really in the Upper Devonian than we were in the Marcellus.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "Just one clarification on Utica and Upper Devonian. It looks like one of your Upper Devonian was more dry gas, one had liquids component. Would you expect though on an average, the Upper Devonian, where you're in a more liquids portion of the Marcellus that you would also have liquids in the Upper Devonian?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, the wet dry area for the Upper Devonian more or less is exactly or approximately mirror the Marcellus.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "You mentioned your acreage up in Northwest Pennsylvania. You start testing potentially later this year with horizontal wells. Do you think at that point that to the extent the Utica is present in Northwest Pennsylvania that you may actually bring some of the Utica into the liquids portion of the window as well?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "It's possible. The difference is -- when you look at the different horizons, there is now thousands of wells that are drilled in the Marcellus. And each Marcellus well have to drill through the Upper Devonian because it's right on top of it. But if you go down to the Utica, very few wells in the basin penetrate the Utica. So, yes, it could be that a portion of that acreage is perspective for the Utica as well. And we have great Utica potential on our acreage, and big reserve outside. But you're right, a lot of it is going to be dry. To the extent that stuff in the northwest works in the Utica, then it would be, could be wet. One other thing, the other neat part of where our acreage is predominantly in the Southwest, you can stack Upper Devonian, Marcellus and Utica. If you go way to the east, you're going to the Utica, if you go away to the west, you'll lose the Marcellus and Upper Devonian. They aren't sort of like, think of, concentric circles and working and you line them all up, that's the one part where you can line up those play. So a lot of our acreage in the Southwest could have stack pay potential in all 3 horizons.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "Okay. Just any update or any more information, you had mentioned, I think, on one of your latest calls, you'll test the Pennsylvania shale in the Permian. What's the timing of that and have there been any other test of that formation in the Permian to date?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, on our Conger field area out in the Permian basin, we've got about 91,000 to 92,000 net acres. We drilled a couple of vertical wells into it a few years back and they made on the order of 15 to 20 barrels of oil per day out of the vertical well. So we've got a nice big shale section that's full of oil and we know there's oil in it because we had a couple of vertical wells in them on our acreage and we know it will flow oil. It's not very good for a vertical well but the question is, if you drill that horizontally, what will it do? To my knowledge, there's only one well in the entire Permian Basin that's drilled horizontally into that section, and it's probably 15 miles, 10 to 15 miles away from our acreage. And that well had an IP of 350 barrels per day and fell off pretty steeply. But the question is, it's a first well and it's a ways away on our acreage. We know we got a big, big section full of oil, can we make it commercial with horizontal drilling? And we've drilled and cased our first well, we'll probably frac it sometime this summer and test it and probably have results in the fall. So we have a nice big block, the HPC  position. Conger has been a great area for us. It's typical of what Range likes. It's stack pays. It produces -- it's hydrocarbon rich, hydrocarbon charged, a good technical team working it. So it fits the model of things we like to work on.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "Okay. In the Mississippian Lime, it sounds like since you first talked about it, you almost doubled your acreage position. You've drilled fewer wells than what operators to the west have drilled. But comparing your thoughts or how would you compare your expectations for the play versus what the operators to the West have outlined in terms of well cost and/or EURs as you accelerate your activity there?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "We've gone from 14,000 acres to 28,000. And we're continuing to pick up acreage, and we'll continue to update that number. It's been a good play for us. It's a field we started redeveloping a while back. So we're looking at we think well cost there, 2.1 million EURs of 300,000 to 500,000 barrels. 140 locations on the acreage we have and like I said, that will grow. So it's a nice play for us. To the west of us, predominantly is SandRidge and Chesapeake and they're having good success in the play. At IPAA, fortunately, there were a lot of people that wanted to meet with us, so we were in one-on-ones and breakout rooms and such, running around New York. So I didn't get to sit through their presentation but from what I hear, I think they're claiming the similar range of reserves, 300,000 to 500,000 barrels is I think what they're claiming. I think the well cost they're claiming are similar. But I would encourage you to ask Chesapeake and SandRidge. But it's a good play and it's oil. It's worked real well for us and we like it.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "And then just if you can say anything else on the MOUs, on the ethane sales, there have been discussions not just of taking it to Sardinia but you -- there was also been discussions of pipeline reversals to the Gulf Coast, and/or getting the ethane out to Philly, which then becomes a world commodity. These MOUs that you're going to be working towards getting agreements in place over the next coming months, I'm assuming all those different options are in the mix in terms of leveraging your position and/or ethane pricing?", "John Pinkerton", "Yes. When you look at kind of going up to 100,000 feet, when we first look at the play, the ethane, we thought long term was going to be a gain item in terms of being able to ramp up our production. We put a team on it several years ago to work on this. And they've done a great job. Greg Davis and Kurt Tipkin [ph] and the other guys, who have just done a fabulous job, and along with Rodney Phelps [ph] is a big player in that team as well. And where we've really gotten to is, a couple things: One, pretty early on, we've made the conclusion that instead of us just working it alone, it made sense to team up with the other wet gas producers. So we've kind of cubbied up, create our own little ethane group. And so, we're really -- while the teams -- the companies are working it individually, we're also working on a collective basis, so we can use our collective purchasing power, if you want to call it that, to leverage what we're doing with the users of the ethane. And I think that was really strategic and really well thought out. And that's really helped us, all of us, all the ethane producers. The other thing that what's happened is the confidence that the ethane users are starting to have that this is going to be a hell of a lot of ethane. And that what relative value they have of having that ethane produced in the U.S. and the relative value that creates in terms of them being able to take that ethane and make the products they want to produce, that most of those products are used in the U.S. So to the extent that now, they can create those -- buy the ethane in the U.S., create the projects in the U.S. and sell it in the U.S., things like transportation cost and all the other things that they had to deal with get taken off the table. So I think it's one of those things where, I think, they're getting more comfortable clearly, the Dow Chemical press release was pretty bullish on their view of that. And I think it's just taking time for those users of the ethane to really get their arms around how much we are going to have and whatnot, and getting confidence in what they are being told by the producers made sense and that's something they could \"hang their hat on\" and whatnot. And that's part of what -- they're going to continue to have to get comfortable on as we go from the MOU stage to the definitive agreement stage, which is a natural progression. But the good news is, I think, overall, the good news is that the number of potential customers for the ethane continues to go up almost daily. And so, it's probably a very competitive situation. At the end of the day, we'll get gas plus for the ethane, which is something that never thought of that was going to happen 2 years ago. We we're hoping it was. But now, it's clearly going to happen. And as Jeff mentioned, once you start stripping that out, and that's a huge impact in terms of our liquids volumes, and it will have a big impact on our realizations and our margins and it will obviously, just enhance the intrinsic rate of return of the project.", "Operator", "The next question is from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "A couple of questions for you on the Upper Devonian, trying to get a sense of the lateral length on those first couple of wells and a number of frac stages you guys have drilled.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, they were the standard 2,500 foot effective lateral with 8-stage fracs. It could be that there's more optimum place to land them, I'm absolutely convinced there is. And it could be that longer laterals and more stages could make a difference than we'll see with time but encouraged by where we are so far.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay. and you guys made a comment that you thought the second well is going to have a better EUR. That's just based on kind of what you're seeing in production history there I imagine and did you do something different with the second well?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, the second well was constrained when we brought it on. But just looking at the production history that we have so far, it hasn't flat or declined, so it projects out a higher recovery. And again, we'll continue to look at those numbers with time. And it's interesting, if you look at our reserves with time over the last few years, they tend to come up with time, which has been very positive too. So we'll continue to watch and look at that. In terms of completions, they were the same. There's -- and I'll just leave it at that.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay. How far apart were those first 2 wells that you guys drilled?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "They were a long ways apart. I don't have the exact distance but probably it's going to be at least on the order of 5 miles or more, 5 to 8 miles, something like that. And we really haven't put a well into the real wet area, the Upper Devonian either yet.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay. I guess just in terms of your acreage in Southwest PA, you've got 550,000 acres there. Just trying to get a sense of how much of that you think is potentially in the dry gas area?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "I'll use a simple cut off. If you use something like 1,000 BTU and, say, anything over 1,000 BTU is a plus because we get paid for that. And eventually, it grades up to where it's over 1,400 BTU. So you probably have roughly on the order of about 2/3 of the acreage would be greater than 1,000 BTUs. And again, you're looking at not just the Marcellus but the Upper Devonian. So you've got 2 horizons there, so you'll get a 2:1, a little bit like the men's warehouse there. It's a twofer.", "Operator", "We are nearing the end of today's conference, we will go to Dan McSpirit from BMO Capital Markets for our last question.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Roger spoke about exploration expense at the top of the call and it being driven by higher seismic expense in the period. Where was that seismic shot mostly?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Most of the seismic is in the Marcellus. We have acquired seismic now either through group shoots or spec shoots over almost everything we have or we will have by the end of the year up in the Northeast. But we're also acquiring a lot of seismic in the Southwest. We started drilling early on without 3D and clearly, you can do that. But like I said, the more we shoot 3D, there's a lot you can get out of it. And you can apply it not only to the Marcellus but you can apply it to the Upper Devonian and to the Utica, more optimally placing the wells and understanding the better areas and things we can see from seismic, we think will really help to continue to drive our well results up, but it's Marcellus.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, great. And second question here, if we could return to the St. Louis well, what is it about that well that the rates are still strong after 12 weeks of production? Is it more about the rock, the completion technique here? And are you getting contribution from another horizon, maybe?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "No. It's just really a high-quality rock. It's really interesting play. When you look at that off of conventional well logs and you can't really see it. It's a play that people have drilled through for years. And it's interesting, you think a lot of those, call it, bypassed or misplay type of things tend to be low quality rock that either needs better technology or something to make it work. In this case, it was recognition that the interval is productive and then once you see it, then you can take that concept and expand off of it. But basically, you got a really highly permeable rock and a lot of it. So you've got a lot of KH. And then when you put a horizontal well in it, you got a lot of KH. So even though the initial rate was a little over 13 million per day and over 900 barrels of liquids per day, that was with about 10% drawdown. So were making 19 million per day with about 10% drawdown. So as we continue to produce it, you're only taking 10% of the productive capacity of the well to get that right. So you can produce at a flat rate for a relatively long period of time.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Do you have the name of that well handy?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "No, because all of our competitors are also on the phone. I'm sure they're already looking at all state records and everything to figure it out, and then to try to figure out. We're continuing to lease as well, and we're picking up leases up there for that kind of potential.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I understand. And then if we could, one last question here, return to the ethane sale agreements here, recognizing that you have a CA in place and that you're limited in what it is you can relay to us. But if you could take a step back here and just give some context on what gave rise to the contemplated agreements? And that is, how did the option originate? I guess, what's the precedent for the agreement?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "I guess I'm not following you, Dan. Can you be a little bit more specific? What do you mean in terms of precedent?", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "What is this agreement based on? Is there an industry agreement out there that you're basing the terms of your agreement with Dow or another company on?", "John Pinkerton", "All our agreements will be simple purchase agreements for ethane that you would typically have anywhere along the Gulf Coast or if you ever had a product, the challenge is we're the producer, they're the end user. How are we going to get the ethanes to them. That is going to have multiple ways in which you could solve that problem. We could deliver to Dow under 2 or 3 different arrangements. Obviously, you'll have a cost impact as to which one you use. So we'll work with Dow to figure out which way to give them their ethane at the lowest price of transportation to them, but what is happening is, as John was speaking about, as there's more confidence that there really are ethanes here and you have a global economy that's using naphtha, now you have this huge push of how do I get off of naphtha and get to ethane. I think what you see is this global movement to the cheapest feedstock that you can. And you'll do all the ethane that you can, and then you'll start doing propanes to get off the naphtha. And so we have a huge source of customers that become much more familiar with what we have to offer. Range's benefit is that we actually now have so many competing offers that I say the ethane price that we will realize keeps going up. So therefore, as Greg Davis told me this morning, our biggest negotiating factor has been in the last year is simply say no, and you get more offers at better prices. So we're just having to methodically go through there because again, all the infrastructure will need to come through and it will have implications as to where the ethanes will be going for the next 10 to 15 years. So it's a big, huge opportunity for us, we're going to maximize that. But some of the unknown ability that people don't appreciate is that once you put the fractionator in and we're actually fractionating and taking the ethanes out, we'll have 12% greater recovery on the propanes.  That's going to add to our propane margin simply because now trying to fractionate the propanes because of the quality in which we have to deliver the propanes, which are not fully extracting out the propanes. We'll get another 12% recovery on the propanes once we extract the ethane. So it's a plus, plus, plus and the story continues to get better  as you look at all the alternatives and you got a global demand for this product.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Right, right. In any of these agreements, do you expect to be held to any minimum delivery volume or other such commitment?", "John Pinkerton", "You will probably have a minimum delivery, you would have under any agreement. But we will also provide for swing volumes over that minimum agreement, so to be able to work that effectively.", "Operator", "This concludes today's question-and-answer section. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Pinkerton for his concluding remarks.", "John Pinkerton", "I know we've gone over a little bit, so we apologize for that. But we really wanted to take as many questions as we could to the extent that you did push the buttons and lined up and weren't able to get to the queue here, I apologize. But Jeff and I and Roger and Rodney and the team will be around the rest of this week. So feel free to call us and we'll be happy to answer any questions or try to answer any questions that you may have. We really appreciate everybody being on the call. To kind of summarize, I think the first quarter was an exceptional quarter for us, 17% increase in production volumes and we're in a terrible winter season, some of the worst that I've ever seen and a 17% increase in per share production, which is what, quite frankly, all I care about is what we're doing on a per share basis. I think it's exceptional, I think we'll get on the cost side, we'll continue to beat that and focus on it everyday. ", "As I mentioned in my call notes, our decision to sell the Barnett was a -- and I had a couple of people say, you got to be crazy. But I think it was bold. But I think it was an appropriate move. I mean, clearly, from the opportunity we have in the Marcellus, and what drove that decision was the Marcellus is getting better. The Upper Devonian is getting better, the Utica is starting to, that bloom is starting to open. Clearly, our success in the Mississippian play, Lime play up in Northern Oklahoma is encouraging. The St. Louis play that we've got is clearly, that's the best well this company has ever drilled. That's fantastic. We've got some opportunities to expand that play. The upside from the Pennsylvania project out in the Conger is clearly has got a lot of risk to it. But that's just a question, I think, our guys over time will figure and like that. And then we didn't talk about Nora and some of the horizontal drilling in the Berea here on there. Nora continues to be one of my favorite fields. So the decision to sell the Barnett was really to, from a position of strength in terms of drilling portfolio, and also creates a position from strength from the balance sheet perspective. So I think, again, I think that sale is huge for our company. And when you look at Range today post that compared to where we were 5 years ago, it's just amazing to see the transformation in the company, but I think it all comes down to the quality of people that we have, that are doing it everyday. So it's a really, I think, a testimony to the entire Range team. And it's -- like I said, we are extraordinarily excited and extraordinarily motivated. This company has got enormous value. As Jeff just went through some of the liquids issues in terms of where liquids component in this company is. We have an extraordinary opportunity and the thing I can assure all our shareholders, we are focused 150% of our effort to ensure that our existing shareholders get every bit of that value that we can possibly squeeze out of this onion. So that's what we're focused on. And again, we look forward to reporting our second, third and fourth quarter results.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements, which you may find more information about on our website at www.rangeresources.com. ", "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President for Range Resources. Thank you. Mr. Waller, you may begin.", "Rodney Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the second quarter of 2011, with an increase in production in realized prices and a decrease in unit costs. As our operations continue to become more efficient, we're able to spend capital more efficiently and realize greater returns.  ", "Range ended the quarter with the strongest balance sheet and the largest liquidity in its history. I think you'll hear these same things reiterated from each of our speakers today. On the call with me are John Pinkerton, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Ventura, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "Before turning the call over to John, I'd like to cover a few administrative items. First, we did file our 10-Q with the SEC this morning. It's now available on the homepage of our website, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we've posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today. We've also added tables which will guide you in forecasting our future realized prices for natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. Detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter is also included on the website and will be updated periodically between quarters. ", "Second, we will be participating in several conferences in August. Check our website for a complete listing for the next several months. We'll be at Tuohy Brothers Energy Conference in New York on August 8; Tudor, Pickering Energy Conference on August 10 in Houston and the EnerCom Annual Oil and Gas Conference in Denver on August 15. ", "Now let me turn it over to John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Rodney. Before Roger reviews our second quarter financial results, I'll review the key accomplishments we achieved in the second quarter. ", "On a year-over-year basis, second quarter production rose 8%, exceeding the high end of our guidance. If you adjust for the Barnett sale, second quarter 2011 productions would have been 33% increase year-over-year.  ", "Our drilling program was on schedule throughout the quarter as we drilled 91 wells. We continue to be extremely pleased with the drilling results. And despite the low natural gas prices, we're still generating very attractive rates of return. Currently, we have 21 rigs in operation. ", "The 8% increase in production was enhanced by our 14% increase in realized prices. As a result, second quarter oil and gas revenues were 23% higher than the prior year. The combination of higher prices and production combined with lower operating costs and unit costs, cash flow was 30% higher than the previous year. ", "Speaking of costs, we are most pleased on the cost performance side. On unit production basis, we saw a 9% decrease in our 5 largest cost categories combined. The only disappointment was that general and administrative expense came in at $0.59 per m, that's $0.07 higher than last year, due to higher legal fees and public relations expense. On the positive side, our DD&A expense and operating costs both continue to climb on a unit production basis, so we're very pleased with those. ", "With regards to our Marcellus Shale play, significant headway was made in the quarter, as we continued to drill fantastic wells, filling our acreage position and continue to build out our infrastructure. In addition, we continue to add high-quality technical personnel to our Marcellus team, which now includes approximately 400 people. ", "Lastly, we did all this while successfully closing the largest sale in our history with the Barnett sale. The sale allows us to aggressively pursue our other higher-return projects. The sale also puts us in the best financial position in our history, with nearly $290 million of cash on hand at quarter end, no outstandings on our $2 billion credit facility and no bond maturities until 2017.  ", "All in all, I'm very pleased with what we accomplished in the second quarter. It's clearly a compliment, and a big shout out to the entire Range team for a job well done. ", "With that, let's turn the call over to Roger, to review our financial results.", "Roger Manny", "Thank you, John. With the Barnett sale closed at the end of April, the second quarter provides a good preview of what may be expected from Range, as it enters its post-Barnett era, namely, strong production growth, lower operating costs, plentiful liquidity and improved capital efficiency. ", "Before I delve into specific financial highlights, please remember that with the Barnett sale, we are again required to report our financial results using discontinued operations accounting. And we filed an 8-K that reflects our historical financial statements without the Barnett, and we've posted supplemental tables on our website and in the press release that reconcile the discontinued operations results with those in our 10-Q that include the Barnett.  ", "Now because the second quarter included one month of Barnett asset ownership, the financial results I'll be presenting on this call, unless specifically noted, will include the historical results of the Barnett assets, which will then mask the supplemental non-GAAP figures in the press release.  ", "Now since the balance sheet received continued attention in the second quarter, as we prepared the company for further expansion in our key plays, I thought we would begin our discussion there.  ", "The first quarter saw the renewal and extension of our 5-year bank credit facility, with a higher commitment amount and borrowing base, lower interest rate and more flexible covenants. The second quarter of this year saw the closing and receipt of proceeds from the Barnett sale, the issuance of $500 million in fixed rate 5 3/4% 10-year senior subordinated notes and the full redemption of our $400 million and 6 3/8% and 7 1/2% notes that were due in 2015 and 2016. ", "Now that all the parts have stopped moving, the end result at 6/30/11 is a balance sheet holding $289 million in cash, a 57-basis point aggregate reduction to 6.85% in our long-term debt fixed interest rate, no long-term note maturities until 2017, an undrawn $2 billion bank credit facility borrowing base that has a $1.5 billion commitment amount and significant strengthening of our leverage ratios. As we continue to press on the development accelerator in our key plays, the balance sheet is well positioned to accommodate this activity. ", "Over on the income statement, there's more good news, starting with oil and gas revenue, including Barnett revenue and cash-settled derivatives of $266 million. This revenue figure is 23% higher than the second quarter of 2010. But just as significant, $266 million in second quarter revenue is only $2 million less than the first quarter this year, even though the second quarter includes just one month of Barnett results. ", "Cash flow for the second quarter was $168 million, 30% higher than the second quarter last year and slightly higher than the first quarter this year, making it the fourth consecutive quarter of improving cash flow despite the Barnett sale. Per-share cash flow for the quarter was $1.06, $0.07 above the analyst consensus estimate.  ", "Second quarter EBITDAX was $201 million, 29% higher than last year and also increasing over the previous 4 quarters. Cash margin for the second quarter was $3.57 per mcfe, up $0.28 from the previous quarter and up $0.65 from last year's second quarter due to higher price realizations from higher liquids production. ", "Quarterly earnings calculated using analyst methodology for the second quarter, which excludes nonrecurring and noncash items, was $43.2 million or $0.27 per fully diluted share. That's $0.08 higher than the analyst consensus estimate, $0.19. ", "Year-to-date cash flow for the first 6 months of 2011 was $331 million, and year-to-date EBITDAX totals $399 million. As Rodney mentioned, please reference the Range Resources website for any questions concerning the reconciliation of these non-GAAP figures, including cash flow EBITDAX, cash margins and analyst earnings. ", "Moving down to the second quarter cost performance. There's more good news to report. The second quarter saw another drop in our DD&A rate from continuing operations from $2.08 per mcfe last year to $1.81 per mcfe in the second quarter. We anticipate that the DD&A rate in the third quarter will be approximately $1.79 per mcfe and will continue to decline further the rest of the year, providing tangible evidence of our steadily improving capital productivity.", "Direct cash operating expense before noncash compensation but including workovers for the second quarter is $0.65 per mcfe. That's down $0.03 from the second quarter of last year, but more importantly, down $0.10 from the first quarter of this year. My compliments to the Range field operations team for all their hard work in getting us back on the path to lower unit operating costs. ", "Cash direct operating expense in the third quarter of this year is anticipated to be approximately $0.64 to $0.67 in mcfe. And we're still hopeful that we can push this unit cost down into the low $0.60 range by the fourth quarter, as our production volumes build and we drive more of our production from our lower cost producing regions. ", "Production taxes for the second quarter were $0.17 in mcfe. That's down $0.02 from last year. We expect production taxes to drop another $0.02 or so in the third quarter. ", "G&A expense adjusted for noncash stock compensation and other nonrecurring items, as John mentioned, was $0.59. That's $0.07 higher than the second quarter last year. G&A expense is sticking around that $0.60 level right now, and listeners can expect third quarter G&A expense to continue to be in the low $0.60 range before coming down a few cents more later this year, as production builds. ", "Interest expense for the second quarter was $0.76 per mcfe, that's slightly higher than last year, due to our issuance of additional long-term, fixed-rate notes and the negative interest carry incurred during the call period on the old notes that were not initially tendered. The $500 million, 5 3/4% note issuance, which replaced $400 million in higher cost debt also explains the one-time noncash $18.6 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt. As I mentioned earlier, the impact of the second quarter long-term note refinancing is significant, resulting in a 57-basis point reduction in the weighted average fixed interest rate on a $1.8 billion of long-term debt. ", "Extending these note maturities another 5 years also improves our future liquidity and lessens our interest rate exposure and refinancing risk. Looking toward the second half of this year, as we work off the remainder of the Barnett sale cash proceeds and our production volumes build, interest expense per mcfe will decline into the low $0.70 range.  ", "Second quarter exploration expense, excluding noncash stock comp, was $11 million, that's $3 million below last year, due to lower delay rentals, offsetting higher seismic expense.  ", "Now the timing of delayed rentals and seismic spending, like dry hole expense, is by nature, unpredictable from quarter-to-quarter. But based on our 2011 budget, we believe exploration expense could increase next quarter, back to the $24 million to $26 million range, depending upon the timing of these expenditures during the second half. ", "Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties came in at $19 million for the second quarter that was $900,000 wide of guidance. And the third quarter of 2011 should bring unproved leasehold impairments of $18 million to $20 million. ", "Range's federal income tax expense remains deferred in the second quarter, as our capital spending exceeds our cash flow, thereby generating excess intangible drilling cost reductions. So no Barnett sale proceeds will be lost to tax leakage, as we have ample NOL carryforwards and IDC deductions to offset the tax gain. ", "During the quarter, Range has continued to add to its hedge position. For the second half of 2011, we are 78% hedged at a floor price of $5 per MMBtu. For 2012, we have approximately 190 million cubic feet per day hedged with collars at a floor price of $5.04 and have recently added 70 million cubic feet per day hedged with swaps at $4.96, that gives us an effective floor price of $5.01 in MMBTu for 2012 on 260 million cubic feet per day of production. In 2013, we now have 160 million cubic feet per day hedged with collars at a price of $5.09 by $5.65 per MMBTu. Now that's up from 100 million cubic feet a day hedged at the end of last quarter. ", "We've maintained our favorable hedges on a portion of our 2011 and 2012 liquids production, with 7,000 barrels per day hedged in the third and fourth quarters of 2011 at $104.17 per barrel and 5,000 per day of 2012 liquids hedged at $102.59 a barrel. All of the hedge prices I just mentioned are net of any applicable premiums paid when establishing the positions. Additional hedging information may be obtained from the tables attached to the press release and also, the more detailed hedging tables Rodney mentioned that reside on our website. ", "As I mentioned in the start of my remarks, the second quarter of 2011 provides a glimpse into what our numbers are going to look like, following the Barnett sale. What you're going to see is strong production growth, greater capital productivity, low operating cost and a strong balance sheet from which to enter the next phase of our continued growth. ", "With that, back to you, John.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Roger. Terrific update. Now let's turn the call over to Jeff to review our operations.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Thanks, John. Range's net production from the Marcellus Shale is currently about 310 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Production performance from Range's wells in the Marcellus continues to improve. The average estimated ultimate recovery from 103 horizontal wells in the southwest portion of the play that were drilled and completed in 2009 and '10 averages 5.7 Bcfe. That's comprised of 4 Bcf of gas and 281,000 barrels of liquids. This has been a great accomplishment by our team. ", "After we drilled the industry's first successful well in the play and later offset it with successful horizontal wells, we estimated that the horizontal wells might be greater than 3 Bcfe per well. We later moved that estimate from a range of 3 to 4 Bcfe, then 3.5 to 4.5 Bcfe, then to 5 Bcfe per well. Now based on 103 wells from our last 2 complete years of drilling, the estimate has increased to 5.7 Bcfe. That's partly the result of our team going up the learning curve regarding how to better drill and complete the wells, and it\u2019s partly due to the rock performing better than we expected. ", "It's important when comparing well results between areas and operators to factor in the completion. Range's 103 wells that averaged 5.7 Bcfe have an average lateral length of 2,802 feet with a non-stage frac. Other operators routinely drill longer laterals and pump more stages. ", "Based on a Goldman Sachs research report dated May 31, the average EUR for the 9 companies that they list is 5.7 Bcfe. However, many of those companies drill significantly longer laterals and pump more stages than Range, yet the average estimated ultimate recovery is the same. That implies that versus the average, the rock quality of what we're drilling is better. It also suggests that if we compete with more stages, we can increase the ultimate recovery of our wells. Of course, the key is to optimize the rate of return of the project not the EUR of a particular well. ", "Another key consideration is that we're still in the early stages of developing this play. Range, for 2011, mostly, is drilling 2,500 foot to 3,000 foot laterals with 8- or 9-stage fracs. With this design, we're generating 105% rate of return and $5 flat NYMEX. The 10-year NYMEX strip price currently averages about $6 per MMBTu. ", "Drilling and completing our wells in this fashion results in a development mode well cost of about $4 million. By keeping our cost down, we're able to drill more wells and hold more acreage and still generate an excellent rate of return. However, we have tested and are continuing to test alternative completions. To mention just a couple of the tests, we now have frac-ed a 3,950-foot lateral with 20 stages in Southwest Pennsylvania and are drilling a 4,500-foot lateral with 15 stages in Lycoming County. ", "Also at this point versus early on in the play, many companies are trying various lateral lengths and completions with lateral lengths up to 9,000 feet. Range will learn not only from our own tests, but we also closely watch the results of industry. ", "At this point, just in the southwest portion of the play, we have about 550,000 net acres. Based on about 1,000 industry wells drilled to date, 500,000 of Range's net acres have been de-risked. Assuming that 80% of the acreage will be drilled and as the development will be on 80 acres, we would then have 5,000 wells to be drilled in the southwest, considering only the Marcellus Shale. ", "Seeing that we've only drilled and completed a little over 200 horizontal wells, according to this math, we may have -- or we have 96% of our wells left to drill. As good as our rates of returns are now, we may be able to improve that going forward. ", "In the northeast portion of the play, we brought online our first 5 horizontal wells in the first quarter. The average estimated ultimate recovery for these 5 wells is 6 Bcf. The average lateral length of the wells is 2,573 feet with a 9-stage frac. For our first 5 wells, that's very encouraging. Again, like the southwest, we're running our own analysis of various lateral lengths and frac stages, and we'll also look at the results of other operators. Looking at the EUR on a per-stage basis, these are outstanding wells. As we bring on multiple wells during the remainder of the year, we plan to put together a type curve for these wells. ", "In the Upper Devonian, we'll be spudding our third well and its formation beginning in early 2011. This well will target the wet gas portion of the play and will be drilled into the area, with what we expect to be the highest gas and liquids content in place. In terms of liquids content, we expect the Upper Devonian will be like the Marcellus Shale, where the Marcellus is wet, the Upper Devonian should be wet. Where the Marcellus is dry, the Upper Devonian should be dry. ", "I also want to point out that the first 2 wells continue to perform very well. In the Utica Shale, we'll spud our second well early next year. The industry has drilled and will be drilling several Utica wells. Results of some of these wells will help to delineate Range's acreage. A lot of our acreage is perspective for both the Upper Devonian and Utica shale, along with the Marcellus. We hold all depth rights on our fairway acreage, so we will focus on driving up reserves and production in the low-risk, highly economic Marcellus play, which will hold the Upper Devonian and Utica potential both above and below the Marcellus. As we better understand the other 2 horizons with time, we'll then determine the optimum plan for each horizon. ", "Moving over to the Midcontinent division, I'll start with the discussion of our horizontal Mississippian play. To date, we have drilled and completed 7 horizontal wells, with an average lateral length of 2,197 feet with 12-frac stages. The average estimated ultimate recovery for these wells is 485,000 barrels of oil equivalent. At $100 per barrel flat NYMEX oil price, this generates about 100% rate of return. ", "Currently, we have over 45,000 net acres in this play, which equates to over 900 potential well locations. If we keep drilling with roughly 2,000 foot laterals, we believe that it will take 12 wells per section to develop the reserves, that equates to a little over 50-acre spacing. Assuming that the average recovery of 485,000 barrels of oil holds, that's a recovery factor of 4% to 9% of the oil in place. ", "Like my comments during the Marcellus talk, I believe that to compare the estimates of ultimate recovery per well between operators or between areas, you have to attempt to factor in the lateral length and frac stages to get a somewhat of an apples-to-apples comparison. We will observe how longer laterals are doing in other areas and what the costs are to drill and complete those types of jobs. ", "We'll also try different lateral lengths and different types of completions ourselves. We will be seeking the solution that generates the best project economics. If the optimum lateral length is longer, say, 4,000 feet instead of 2,000 feet, then the number of wells per section would most likely decrease from 12 to 6, and the spacing per well would increase from over 50 acres to over 100 acres per well. ", "Of course, the advantage to this play, like the Marcellus, is that there's a lot of hydrocarbon in place. Given the strong technical team that we have, coupled with the industry's track record of driving up recovery factor with time, I believe that is what we'll see happen here as well. Typically, the higher recovery factor comes from down spacing and better completions. ", "Up in the Texas Panhandle, we had excellent success with our first horizontal St. Louis well. It came online at 13.8 million per day and 903 barrels of liquids or about 19.2 million per day equivalent. After producing for about 7 months, it's still making 12.3 million per day and 760 barrels of liquids or 16.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Payout was within weeks. We'll be drilling 4 additional horizontal St. Louis wells this year. ", "At this point, I'll turn the call back over to John. I'll be happy to answer your questions in the Q&A.", "John Pinkerton", "Thanks, Jeff. Now let's look forward a bit. Looking to the second half of 2011, we see continued strong operating results. For the third quarter of 2011, we're looking for production to average 515 million to 520 million a day. ", "Factored into the third quarter production guidance is our Barnett sale. In the second quarter, the Barnett production was included for one month. For the third quarter, no Barnett production will be included. Assuming we hit the mid-range of our guidance for the third quarter, it will represent a 3% increase year-over-year. The 3% increase does not adjust for the Barnett sale. If you adjust for the Barnett sale, the year-over-year production growth would be 31%. We made up about half of the sold Barnett production by the end of the second quarter, and we expect to make up the other half by the end of the third quarter. So that's kind of exciting. We're right on track with that, and that's our business plan. ", "Now I'm going to talk a little bit about the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we currently anticipate production to average between 606 million to 611 million a day. Assuming the midpoint, this equates to a 13% increase year-over-year, again including the Barnett. Adjusting for the Barnett sale, this equates to a 43% increase year-over-year. ", "Most of the fourth quarter production increase will come from wells that we've already drilled, and we're currently weighing pipeline connection. When you take this into account in the third -- in the fourth quarter production guidance, you can see we still expect to achieve 10% production growth, including the impact of the Barnett sale. ", "We also still expect to exit 2011 with the Marcellus shale production at 400 million a day net. Looking for -- looking at 2012, we're currently looking for production increase in the 25% to 30% range year-over-year and are still forecasting that we'll exit the Marcellus at 600 million a day or better on a net basis. ", "Now that we've closed the Barnett sale, I'll just take just a moment to look at the impact of our divestiture program. Including the Barnett sale, our divestiture efforts have yielded nearly 3 \u2013 pardon me, yielded nearly $2 billion in sales proceeds. It has also reduced our well count by approximately 6,000 wells. This represents about 60% of our well count. ", "The properties we sold were more mature, higher cost properties. The good news is that while we were selling our more mature properties, we were focusing our capital on higher-return projects. Despite the asset sales, our production and reserves had continued to increase. As a result, Range is now a more efficient company. We are doing more with less. By less, I mean, less wells, lower finding and development cost, lower operating costs, et cetera.  ", "The second quarter results reflect a lower cost. In the third and fourth quarter results, you should see further progress in lowering our unit cost. Over the medium to long term, this will have a significant impact on our per share value. This is critical to generating attractive returns in a low gas price environment. In addition, by having fewer wells and properties and a more compact asset base, we can better focus our technical team on higher-return projects and make these projects better and better over time. ", "Lastly, one of Range's hallmarks is to keep things simple. By having fewer wells and fewer properties, Range is a simpler company, allowing the Range team to focus more of its efforts on driving up per-share value. ", "Besides the operating efficiencies, the Barnett sale was hugely important event for our company. First, the sales proceeds more -- were more than sufficient to retire all of our outstanding bank debt, with excess proceeds available to help fund our ongoing capital program. As a result, Range has, by far, the strongest balance sheet in its history. ", "Second, the proceeds generated by the sale are the catalyst for Range to become internally funded by the end of 2013. Obviously, natural gas prices will have a big impact on our ability to achieve this. And as you can see, we have put on additional natural gas hedges in 2012 and '13 to help us out in this area. ", "Since closing the sale, we have focused all of our energy on executing our business plan and driving up production reserves on a per-share basis with a top-quartile cost structure. The driver of this growth is our drilling inventory, which, I believe, is exceptional. We have the drilling results in place -- we have the drilling projects in play that at low natural gas prices, generate outstanding rates of return. As Jeff mentioned, our operating teams are continuing to enhance and improve our well results while maintaining our solid safety record. ", "While clearly biased, I'm convinced we have an exceptional asset base and drilling inventory, as well as an exceptional team of people driving our performance. Our management team is keenly focused on enhancing our asset base and improving our team's performance. Selling our Barnett property was somewhat of a bold move, as the Barnett property comprised approximately 20% of our production. However, we believe it best served Range shareholders, as it allows Range shareholders to retain 100% of our 35 to 52 Tcf of current resource potential. ", "Also, as I mentioned earlier, we currently anticipate 25% to 30% production growth in 2012, including the impact of the Barnett sale. From an investor's point of view, I believe Range is somewhat of a unique proposition. Because of our high-quality drilling inventory and low-cost structure, we can generate attractive returns at today's low natural gas prices. This provides substantial downside protection. On the other hand, because of the extraordinary resource potential at the Marcellus shale, in our other project, we have one of the largest per share upsides of any company in our peer group. ", "With the Barnett sale behind us, we are extremely excited and motivated. We appreciate the support and confidence of our shareholders that have shown -- that you've shown us. And we look toward, with great pleasure, to the second half of 2011. ", "With that, operator, why don't we turn the call open for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Gentlemen, our first question is from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice & Company.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "Question on the Mississippian, Jeff. You started talking about the lateral links. I know in your first 7 wells the 2,200-foot lateral's lower than what other operators have been testing, which is roughly double that, yet your recoverabilities in terms of EURs are about the same. What's driving the performance in terms of EURs versus a lower -- a shorter lateral length? And what does that presage if you drill longer laterals, in your opinion?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "That's a great question. I think, I said a similar type thing in the Marcellus. If you look at our average complete -- if you look at the average recovery per the Goldman Sachs report, Range is right in the middle of the pack, yet our wells are significantly -- have significantly fewer stages and shorter laterals. Sort of implies that we have higher-quality rock at where we are. And plus it says, we may have upside in terms of well recovery can continue to go up if we decide to move those completions up. And I think the same thing would be true in the horizontal Mississippian play to get a similar recovery from a shorter lateral might imply higher quality rock or higher oil cup. So that would say that there could be upside in terms of if we change our completion design. That being said, I'd like to reemphasize that what we're currently doing in both plays generates greater return, greater than 100%. So I think the good news though is that there's upside beyond where we are today.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "Great. And then a follow-up, just in terms of planned activity, you've drilled 7 wells. How much activity do you think you\u2019ll have over the second half of the year in terms of rig count or well count? And then, are you also staying ahead of the game in terms of saltwater disposal systems to handle the wells once they're ready to be completed?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, let me answer -- let me do it in the order that you said. For the second half of the year, we have no drilling activity planned there, and we're currently putting together, and we will be putting together, now and through the fall, our budget and capital spending plans for 2012. It's very early but, I believe what you'll see, subject to board approval is we'll start program drilling early next year in the Mississippian, where we have at least one rig, and we'll be looking up and we'll pick up the second rig and so on. So you'll start to see program drilling next year. The good news is if you only roll back and answer that question about the saltwater disposal in a 2- or 3-minute answer, if you look at what we did up in that area, we really started there a few years ago. And we started there, and we got into the area, because we thought it was a good stacked-pay area, and we had a really strong technical team, which is sort of the types of things that we look for strategically within the company. So stack-pay area, literally from almost 700 feet down to TD, which there is literally 6,000 feet or a little shallower. Great stack-payer, you have probably more than 20 productive horizons. So we started developing some of the shallow horizons 4 or 5 years ago, in really the Tonkawa section out there, the Tonkawa sands. And with that, we put in our water disposal systems and everything. Probably, about 2 to 3 years ago we shot a 3D over that big field and started drilling deeper targets in the Mississippian and then in the Wilcox, all with good success and continued to expand out to water disposal. And then we moved off structure and started drilling the Mississippian off structure with good success. And then start -- and these were all vertical wells. And then we started, last year, drilling horizontal Mississippian wells, again with good success, 7 wells averaging 485,000 barrels of oil equivalent. And then it's a very liquids-rich area. So we have our water disposal system in there, and we will stay ahead of that. And the good news there is you got a great disposal zone directly below you in the Mississippian and the Arbuckle, very prolific water disposal zones. So I think we're in great shape, strong team. We're building a really exciting acreage position, and you'll see us start continuing drilling, I believe, next year.", "Ronald Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.", "And lastly, just to expand on that last comment, the acreage position has gone from 15,000 to 28,000 to 45,000 acres. And given your size and scale, the question -- last question just on scalability of this play, which has continued to grow in aerial extent and by the higher profile that you're placing on this, is this a scenario that you would look to expend incremental capital?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, we're very judiciously picking up additional acreage, and really, today, our acreage position's probably a little above that. And we're, really, probably approaching about 1,000 potential locations, assuming it all continues to drill out. If you take 1,000 locations and -- it's very early, but those 7 wells average 485,000 barrels of oil equivalent. 1,000 locations if it worked out times 485,000 barrels. That's 485 million barrels of oil. And then when you net that back, just on the acreage position we have really, in hand, we're about close to 400 million barrels net. That's impactful. I think our team is -- we're continuing to acquire additional acreage, and I think we can build that. So can we build 1,000 maybe in the 1,500 locations and beyond? So 400 million barrels might become 600 million barrels and beyond. And we're acquiring that in a very disciplined fashion, in a blocky position, where we've got good infrastructure. So I'm excited about the team there and the play that we have.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Kistler with Simmons & Company.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company International", "On a little bit bigger picture basis, if we reflect on BHP's bid for Petrohawk, where they're certainly putting or willing to pay for resource potential above and beyond proved and kind of look towards your position in the Marcellus. And it\u2019s definitely focused on kind of the Utica and Upper Devonian, where you've done a little testing but not a lot. Given the strong financial position, do you think about accelerating testing there, basically, to prove up resource potential in an effort for a marketplace that might have more consolidation?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, let me start out by talking a little bit just about potential, and then I'll turn it over to John to speak to the more global issue. One of the things I want to say, I mentioned in my notes, and we have just a couple of Upper Devonian wells that we\u2019ve tested. But every single Marcellus well that we drill goes through the Upper Devonian. So we have well logs and shells, and in some cases, whole cores or sidewalk cores on those intervals. And a lot of it looks prospective for our southwest portion of the acreage. And just like the Marcellus, a lot of it's wet. So when we talk about having on the order of 500 million barrels net to us of NGLs in the Marcellus with the position we have, leaving the ethanes in the gas, we have a big upside in terms of Upper Devonian. We did drill and complete a couple of wells. I mentioned they\u2019re performing well. And I talked about them on the last call, so you can go back and look at it. But we talked about just a couple of wells, so it's not a valid sample, but we have a lot of data. We've mapped it. And you look at the -- last time, I mentioned a better well looked like it might be on the order of 3.5 Bcf. Since then, the wells producing -- the decline curve really has flattened. And when we look at the reserve estimates today, that initial well looks like it might be a 4.7 B, which is really exciting, considering we only drilled and completed 2. So there's a lot of upside in terms of how we can drill and target, and we'll consider that. The other thing I want to point out, in terms of the Upper Devonian and some of our, really, Marcellus acreage, where we\u2019ve targeted the first Upper -- 2 Upper Devonian wells. The first well, we just targeted away from the Marcellus wells to make sure that we had a good clean test. The other one was sort of off of a pad, where we had a lot of wells, and we were wanting to make totally sure the gas was coming from the Upper Devonian. We had a lot of control. We didn't sit back and target, where is the thickest, best, wettest portion of the play. Our next well's going to do just that. So we really haven't even targeted, from a technical point of view, where the best area should be, plus you got to factor in the whole completion size, length, how do you land it, all that type of thing. So I think there's a lot of upside in the Upper Devonian. Same thing would be true, some of our Marcellus, only just roll back there a little bit, but it's important, I think, in the global question that you ask. Since Ranger -- when we pioneered -- the plant started, we picked Washington County to drill it. And we had good success, so we continued to drill around there. And then when we drilled up in Lycoming County, where we started recently, same thing. We didn't target our biggest, thickest, best portion of the play. There, we started drilling where there was a pipeline connection. So off of our first few wells, we're getting wells that look like off of 9-stage fracs. It could be 6 Bs. I mean, you could proportionately say, what if those were 18-stage fracs or 16-stage fracs, what would the recovery factor be for those wells? And then you got to factor in that we haven't drilled the highest gas in place, biggest, thickest, portion yet. Same is even true of some of the stuff in the southwest. So I think there's a lot of upside, technically, to our position. And the Utica is a bigger wildcard, because it's below both of those horizons, not a lot of tests in them. But our first well, which I believe was the industry's first horizontal, was clearly encouraging. There's a lot of rumors, and I'm sure everybody on the call has heard them in terms of other Utica wells. And I'm sure you're going to hear some outstanding Utica wells between now and the end of the year. And a lot of our acreage looks prospective for the Utica as well. For the Marcellus and for the Upper Devonian, we have big portions of the wet gas, along with some dry gas in the Utica, were primarily all, for the most part, dry gas. With that, I'll turn it over to John.", "John Pinkerton", "Yes. I mean, I obviously second what Jeff said. I think, in terms of the -- in specific, Dave, you asked about the BHP-Petrohawk deal. I mean, I think the key takeaway for me on that was, one hail to Floyd Wilson. So I'm going to send Floyd a nice bottle of wine here. But in reality, kidding aside, I think, what it tells you is, is that NAV really matters. And at the end of the day, the companies that can drive up their NAV on a most cost-efficient basis, on a per-share basis, are the ones who are going to be the big winners. And that's all we're focused on. And we\u2019ve found a giant gas field. We're going, I think, relatively fast. In fact, I think even some of those bigger companies, at least in the short term will actually go slower but -- until they get their feet on the ground. But we're going relatively fast. I think, as Jeff mentioned, the good news is there's going to be lots of other Upper Devonian and Utica wells drilled by other people that'll help develop the industry's perception. And of these other plays, just like in the Marcellus, we were the first ones to kind of jump up out of the bunker, running up the hill. And then over time, our friends at Cabot and all the other companies started drilling really good wells. And that's really good for us, because it helps: one, it helps the play in general; and two, it really helps acreage that we have in and around a lot of these other operators. I mean, damn, we own a whole lot of acreage. So when other people drill around us, it really helps us. And we're trading logs between companies now and trading data. So all that's happening, and that's all really good for Range and its shareholders. And again, I think at the end of the day, we're really focused on driving up NAV per share. We understand that all of this has a time horizon. But again, you just look back and you look in some of our presentation materials, and you look at the production curve of the Marcellus 3 years ago, we were at 20 million a day, then 100 million, then 200 million, then 400 million, and 600 million. And you start -- you continue that up, and then you add these other formations on, and then you add the Upper Devonian. I mean, you add some of the other projects we're doing in other areas. You can really see, I think, a pretty dramatic increase in terms of production and at low cost. And I think that'll continue to transfer into an NAV number. Obviously, we've got one, it's dramatically higher than we think the stock price is today. I mean, in multiples of where the stock price is today. But it's up to us to prove it, and that's what we're into. And we want to do it on a per-share basis. That's why we sold the Barnett, because we were confident we could take the money, recycle it and still have good growth for 2010 and then -- I mean, 2011 and outstanding growth for 2012, '13, '14 and '15. But it's up to us to prove it. And that's what we're doing right now -- is trying to prove it. And hopefully, over time, as we prove it, the market will give us credit. But we don't expect the credit until we prove it, and that's what we're all about.", "David Kistler - Simmons & Company International", "Great. I appreciate that. And maybe just as a follow-up in terms of you highlighting the purpose to drive NAV going forward. If we think about what you guys have said in the past where your 2012 CapEx budgets being much like 2011, yet coming into today, balance sheet's a lot better, credit facility certainly provides plenty of room to outspend cash flow, returns out of the Marcellus, they're better, efficiencies are getting better, offsetting service costs. Should we be thinking 2012 CapEx goes higher as a way to accelerate the increased NAV?", "John Pinkerton", "David, that's a really good question, and that's something that Jeff and I and Roger and some of the other guys, when we go out to lunch, we talk about a lot, thinking through. I think we're just now starting to kind of tinker around and look at 2012. Obviously, we\u2019ve got a long-range plan that's got some fences around it. But in terms of the specifics, we're now -- we're just starting to tinker with that. And Jeff and I were just talking about it this morning, in fact. And one, it's pretty exciting, and we've got a lot of opportunity. And it's good to see our costs coming down, because that allows us to do more. But yes, I mean, we expect to generate great growth for 2012. But we're going to be opportunity-driven. And to the extent that the Mississippian or St. Louis plays has those opportunities, we're going to do the best we can to fund those things, to capture those things for our shareholders. So right now, I think it's just a little early. We need to get our numbers finalized. We need to get to our board, which we'll do later in the year. But no, we're going to -- one of the great things that we've done, as you mentioned, is we have great balance sheet. And so it's great to have a great balance sheet. Every once a while, you need to use it, which is what Roger always says. Now Roger's going to be -- make sure that Jeff and I don't go off the reservation but -- so we got a great balance sheet, to the extent that the Mississippian turns out great or the St. Louis. We'll have the -- we have the dry powder to exploit those things and take advantage of them. And again, that's a great place to be, and that's one of the things that we were hopeful would happen with the sale of the Barnett. And the good news is that it happened. We closed the Barnett. We've made up -- really, we've made up about over 60% of production, and we'll have the rest of it made up by the end of this -- the third quarter. So I guess, this -- it clearly puts us on the offensive. And that's really exciting and I think, for our operating teams, it's exciting, and some of the opportunities we see. And quite frankly, there's other things that we're working on, kind of grassroots things that we're working on that we haven't discussed. But some of those even look pretty exciting, and obviously, they're small and they\u2019re not going to take much capital, more thoughts and ideas and a little bit of acreage and a few wells here and there. But I can assure you, we've got a great inventory. I can't be more excited about where the company is today and the future that holds for the company than any time in my measly 22 years since I've been President or CEO of the company. So it's just an incredibly exciting time at Range. And you can really see it around the office and the employees and whether it's Pittsburgh or Oklahoma City or Abingdon, Virginia or West Texas, some of the projects we have out there. They're really excited to be at Range right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gil Yang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Could you -- John, you said that -- you highlighted again, I think, you said in the first quarter that in the fourth quarter, a lot of the growth was going to come from the backlog of wells that you will complete. Can you just review for us what that backlog is currently, where you think it could be at the end of the year? And what parts of the Marcellus as well as are \u2026", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, Gil, this is Jeff Ventura. Let me jump in with that question. When you look at the northeast, we put 5 wells on in the first quarter. We recently brought on 5 more. We have 27 more coming on by the end of November, so that'll be 37 wells up there. And then we talked about 21 wells awaiting connection in the southwest and 51 awaiting completion. Of the 21 awaiting connection, we'll put 14 of those on in the third quarter and one in the fourth. And of the 51, while waiting completion, there are probably 90% of those will be on or 80% to 90% by the end of the year. And that's where the growth -- a lot of the growth that John's talked about is going to come from.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. You made a comment that the 2009, 2010 program is 5.7 Bcf. If you look at the presentation -- your presentation, your 2011 wells are tracking a little under that. Is there anything going on that -- or you\u2019re doing in this areas? Are you doing shorter laterals? Or are you doing anything peculiar?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes. Gil, if you actually look at that, it's actually the 2011 wells are higher. They're not lower. If you look on the -- Rodney has the curve, right here. If you look at the 2011 wells -- maybe you're talking about we're early on, on the IP, that's just a function of some constraints and all gathering. But the overall quality of the wells looks good and really is on par, if not, a tick higher when you look at the -- each individual well, individually, and project the math.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Yes. I'm just looking at the aggregate data that you showed in your presentation.", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, yes, yes. That's just a function of some constraints early on, sort of like that Upper Devonian well that I mentioned. Early on, on that Upper Devonian, we talked about the first well. Now I'm saying, it looks like it might be 4.7 B that came on under constraint conditions of 2.5 million per day, 1.9 million gas and 91 barrels of liquids you have to have a 4.7 Bcf well. So ultimately at the end of the day, we think it's about rate of return, not about IP. It's the full shape of the curve. Looking at the individual well data that we're looking at, we're excited about our 2011 program.", "Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Right. And it sounds like the 2011 program, you're basically tracking the lateral length and other stages of the previous 2 years of [indiscernible], right?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, that's correct. It's on par, it's very similar. But like I said, we put a number of experiments out there. We frac the well that just probably about a month ago in the southwest that had 20 stages in it. So we're looking at some of those types of things.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Following up on your comments on the Upper Devonian what is the thickness and thickness variability that you're seeing there that you expect versus the Marcellus? And what are you thinking about rates of return from drilling a shale or Upper Devonian zone versus what you're seeing in the deeper Marcellus?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Well, when you look at it, it's a combination and not just thickness. But at the end of the day, it comes down, I believe, to hydrocarbon in place and how much of it can you get out. The Upper Devonian section relative to the -- and really where it's -- we feel it's -- the highest prospectivity is in the southwest, although there's a couple of good Upper Devonian wells, even in the central part of the State, so it has potential in a lot of areas. When you look at the thickest part of the Upper Devonian, in general, say, in the southwest -- it's actually on our website, you can look at it, there's a type log. The section in aggregate is thicker than the Marcellus is but the Marcellus is more organic. When you look at gas in place, it ends up actually being about equal. So where we've got 80 to 120 Bcf a section in the Marcellus, the Upper Devonian is about the same. So basically, you could pick the midpoint. Say it\u2019s 100 Bs a section in the Marcellus. The Upper Devonian doubles that to 200 Bs a section. And to go the other way, it's interesting, the Utica in a lot of cases is a little bit more than that. It's probably like down in that same area, maybe 120 to 140 B, so it can be an aggregate in over 300 Bs per section. And the exciting part is that it's predominantly stacked in the southwest. Specifically, though, going back to the Upper Devonian, I think, 2 wells are just too early. It's really exciting though that on our second well it looks like 4.7 Bs as of today. And every time we look at it, the decline gets a little flatter. What we haven't done is targeted the highest gas in place interval or the highest in -- like I was saying earlier, ends up actually with the hydrocarbon in place is actually in the wet part in the Upper Devonian down there. So we'll be spudding a well right on that bull's eye, but it's a big bull's eye in a big area. The section itself is literally right on top of the Marcellus. So even though it's a little bit shallower, the well costs in reality are going to be pretty much the same. But the exciting part is we'll have an infrastructure in there. We have a team there, and you're going to have roads and well pads and gathering and takeaways, so there's really an exciting upside to it.", "John Pinkerton", "Brian, this is John. When -- if you just go and drill your Upper Devonian wells on the same pad site, where you drilled your Marcellus well, when you take into account the road, the pad sites, the gathering systems, if you look at all the costs there, you've already spent -- you already got -- you can cheat off somewhere 25% to 30% of your well costs have already been expended by the Marcellus wells that you've already drilled. So it really, it kind of turbocharges your Upper Devonian returns, if you drill on top, but on the same pad sites where you\u2019ve already drilled your Marcellus wells.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. That's helpful. Going to the Marcellus, you highlighted the higher IPs. One of the reasons for that was better-than-expected rock performance. Are you seeing that in the form of just better IP rates or lower declines? And are you seeing that more in the first-year decline rate or in more of the longer and medium-term decline rate?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Let me better define that. If you look at those curves, in general, every year, we're progressing upward when you look at -- from when we started until now. But it's not just IPs, it\u2019s flatter declines and therefore, higher ultimate recoveries. So what I'm saying when we\u2019re looking at moving the ultimate recovery from 3 to 4 to 5, now it looks like for the last 2 full program years 5.7. I'm saying that in aggregate is a combination of better completion, but a big part of it is just flatter declines.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And is that flatter decline happening in the long-term decline rate, or is it more your wells you thought would decline at a bigger first-year rate and they\u2019re not declining at that rate, they\u2019re declining at a lower rate?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "I think it's a combination of that. It's a combination of both. It's that whole curve has probably shifted to a shallower decline.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. Great. And lastly, can you just refresh us on how much further down you think your OpCosts can go, as you ramp up the Marcellus, and as we see more NGLs coming on does that lead to any uptick in costs, in addition to the uptick in realizations?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "I mean, when you look at -- the nice part about where we're, at least, for this year, we're putting 86% of our capital into the Marcellus and historic. So one, if you look at the Marcellus wells, they're high rate flowing gas wells. So they're pretty inexpensive to operate initially. And then like John mentioned, we've divested a couple of billion dollars worth of properties, a lot of those in general were higher-cost properties, higher LOEs. So by not drilling in those areas and selling them, coupled by focusing our capital in our highest rate of return, low LOE area, we'll continue drive them down. As far as specific guidance, I don't know. Roger, I think, talked about where we expect to be in fourth quarter. And we haven't given guidance, I don't think beyond that yet.", "Roger Manny", "Yes, Brian. Low 60s, I think, we feel real good about. I mean, getting something with a 5-handle's going to take a lot more work, but we'll see what 2012 holds for us.", "John Pinkerton", "This is John. I'll be a little bolder here. Yes, I can do that, I guess. I think Brian, great -- I've got great confidence in our team. And one of the things -- if you think about the fourth quarter, we're going from 515 to 520 in the third quarter. And we're going to 606 to 611 in the fourth quarter. If you think about that, a lot of those -- a lot of that production increase is coming from wells we've already drilled and completed -- in most cases completed, and we\u2019re waiting on pipeline. I mean, it's going to take some more people to operate those wells, but it's not going to be the same, because a lot of the people operate those wells and in those areas, we've already hired and trained and everything else. So I'm really looking to the fourth quarter with a lot of excitement to see where those costs come down. And I don't want to set a bar that drives Roger and Jeff crazy, but I think that's going to be a great snapshot, in terms of the capital efficiency not only on the drilling side, but also on the operating side, as we turn those wells on, and you get that production increase in the fourth quarter. So I think that's going to be a good data point in terms of that whole -- where we can take this thing. But I'm going to be -- -- I'm cautiously optimistic. I think the guys will hit the ball out of the park. But again, we'll stick with Roger's numbers, and then hopefully, we'll over-perform and make everybody happy, including me.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Just wanted to jump into Northeast Pennsylvania a little bit more. I guess, talked about 6 Bcf EUR. Just curious as to where the well costs are up there right now?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes. Well, let me start with the southwest, and I'll move up there. We said in the development mode in the southwest would be at $4 million. And actually, I'm glad you brought it up, because one of the questions somebody asked earlier today was, where are you today? And when you look at today, off the AFPs that are coming in the Southwest, a lot of the wells are 4 million to 4.2 million. I've seen some straight away wells as low as 3.8. We just got one and some lighter swing outs, 4.4. But a lot of the wells are just a tick over 4 million. So the team's done a excellent job of driving down costs in the development mode. And remembering, we started a lot higher like you typically do. In the northeast ultimately, if we\u2019re at 4 million in the southwest, we'll put some economics and stuff out later on. And in development mode, those wells might be 5.2 million, something like that. And we're probably 200,000 to 400,000 over that for the wells today. But the guys are making great progress quicker, and we're climbing that curve there even quicker than I thought. I still think -- and those are the numbers, I said 3 years ago when we started into the play, and if you go back to -- Ray Walker's in here, and he's looking at me. And Mark Whitley\u2019s just left the room -- and you go back to some of those early wells in the Southwest, our first 3 horizontals in 2006. We never really said what they were, but they were fairly ugly. You were looking at wells of 6 million. And I said, ultimately, I believe, the team could get them to 4 million in development mode. Well, we're only 200 wells in. We got 96% of the wells left to drill, and that's probably a conservative number. At 96% left to drill, and yet we're almost right there in the Southwest. And I still think there's a lot of upside if we kept that same completion design, and we're -- in terms of where that team, John Applegath [ph] and team can drive those numbers to, Don Robinson and the other guys. If you go up to the Northeast, I thought it would take us a lot longer to get to where we are. But they're early wells up there. Remembering, you're a couple thousand feet deeper than in the southwest. Lycoming County is one of the deeper parts of the play. They're making a ton of headway early. And Mark Whitley told me recently that he thinks development mode is comfortable with 5.2 million. That's Mike Middlebrook's division now. David, Don and the guys working on that with the right ground staff, I'm sure they can get those numbers there quickly. And I think in time, we'll surpass them. Like I said, if we're already in a development mode, 4% of the wells in, I think there's a lot of upside in terms of what that team can do.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Great. I guess, just switching gears a little bit over to the Mississippian. You guys clearly picked up more acreage. You got just over 45,000 net acres there now. Just curious as to how much of that you think is de-risked by your drilling as well as industry? And if you can kind of on a ballpark there?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, it's really interesting. We've had really good success drilling in that area for a few years in multiple horizons including verticals. We drilled a lot of verticals into the section so we have good control. Our horizontals, I think, if you look at the 2 farthest wells apart, they're on the order of 7 miles. But when you really come up to a 50,000-foot level and look at the play, we're having a really good success where we are. If you go off to the west, SandRidge and Chesapeake a long ways away, and a whole way from where we are, they have wells close to us that goes a long ways out. We're having good success, and if you go off to the east, there's some smaller independents that are having good success as well. So I think it's an exciting play. It's a big oilfield. And we've got a good position and it's growing. So I think it's so far so good. Oh, well cost? We're at -- right now, we're around -- we said we'd drill complete costs of $2.9 million, and we allocated a couple hundred thousand of saltwater disposal well to that to account for. We just allocated our saltwater disposal well back on a per-well basis. We're close to that now. We're not too far away from that. And we really haven't put together, hey, if we have literally 1,000 wells to drill, where do we think we'll be on well 100 or 150. But again, we've got a great team up there led by Max Holloway and Bill Coger [ph] and got a great drilling group working for them. I'm sure there will be good things there as well, with time.", "Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Got it. I guess, last quick question for you guys. You talk about potentially accelerating this play in 2012. I guess, you got a couple other wells you're going to drill in the St. Louis line. That looks to me to be your best rate of return well at this point in time? I think, Jeff, you said it\u2019s paid out in a number of weeks. I guess, you got other locations there. I mean, I guess, that would seem to be another play that given the quick payout you would think you could accelerate that potentially. Can you guys comment on that and maybe what you think your inventory might be in the St. Louis line?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes. We'll drill 4 more St. Louis wells there this year. We just drilled and set pipe on the first one. In fact, today, we started completion on it. When you look at the St. Louis though, it's a very different play than the Marcellus, obviously, the shale play along with the Upper Devonian and Utica. And the shale plays have a large scope, that's the unconventional part. The Mississippian play is a carbonate. And you've got a chat component and a lime component, but it's more of a conventional play where you have to move a lot of water. When you move to the St. Louis, it's very conventional. You have a really high-permeability, high-quality reservoir there as evidenced by the higher flow rate unlocked with horizontal drilling really. But you've got to find that up on a structure. So you got to have more of a conventional trap, either a closed structure or 3-way closure against the fault or whatever. So they're more distinct -- discrete targets that you're looking at. The good news is our guys have identified a handful of those, and we've leased them. I'm encouraged about future potential for what that can be. But those leases are new, we've got a lot of time. It's high rate of return, we'll drill the next 4 wells and see where we  are. And like we talked about, we'll put together our capital spending plan for 2012 into the fall, present it to the board and then typically, we announce it to you guys early next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Carver with Capital One Southcoast.", "Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.", "Most of my questions were answered but I did have a question. I know at some conferences recently, you've talked about putting together some long-term contracts with ethane users to buy ethane or that you would sell ethane to them primarily for the Appalachian play. Can you update us on any progress there? Any plans for the timing of those contracts?", "John Pinkerton", "Marshall, it's John. Yes, great question. We've made a lot of progress. And we're getting really, really close on probably our first ethane contract. And the team, Greg Davis and [indiscernible] also helps out enormously on that team as well along with Chad Stephens [ph]. And so we're making really good headway there. We don't -- from what we see today -- and there's lots of really good things that's happening on the ethane front, in terms of a lot of other people are getting into play. And you probably saw Sunoco with their open season on one of their projects up there that's, obviously, a very good move and shows you some of the progress being made. But everything's going great. We ought to have some time before -- either on or before the third quarter, we ought to have something pretty definite that we can tell you. And so it's going along better and faster than I would have hoped. So it's all good there.", "Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.", "Okay. And one other question, there was that big Marcellus commissioned report for Pennsylvania filed last week. Was there any -- did you all look through it and were there any surprises in there? Or was it mostly straightforward and what you expected?", "John Pinkerton", "Well, first of all, we think it was really great leadership by the governor to put the commission together and get all the different stakeholders together, so we could all kind of work on a long-term solution to issues that are out there. So I commend the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor for making it happen. And I also commend all the people who worked on it. We, Ray Walker, who heads up -- who's with us, and obviously, opened up our Marcellus office in Pittsburgh and turned the light on when he was a single employee, and now, we have over 400 people there -- was on the commission and had, obviously, a big role in that. And in all those commissions you have different kinds of people and whatnot. But I think at the end of the day, when you filter through all the recommendations, I think it was an enormous step forward for the state. And now, there's a buffet table there of recommendations. And now, we need to take some real time and effort in smaller groups probably to work on certain of those recommendations that the Governor tells us that are most important and move those forward. At the end of the day, I don't think there were any real surprises to us. A lot of the things that are being recommended, we're already doing in a large way. So from my perspective and I think from Range's perspective, it was really well done, and it's a great step forward. And again, I think it helps to find on both sides expectations from both sides and a lot of different parties involved -- and I think that way -- it's really the first time you got all those constituencies all in one room working together to try to find solutions versus just punching each other in the nose. So I think that's a great step forward, and I think everybody sees the benefit. Clearly, the Governor does and the House and the Senate up in Pennsylvania sees the huge benefit it's already had and will have. So I think it's a great step forward, and I really commend them for the work that was done in a relatively short period of time. But now, the hard work starts. You got to take those recommendations and turn them into something and so -- but I think, again, I think there's a lot of people who really want to make it work so -- including us. So we'll continue to work really hard and dedicate a lot of resource to making sure it's done and quite frankly, done right, which is one of the things that we've always talked about. So pretty excited about it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo Advisors.", "David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "A lot of questions have been asked, could you guys talk about -- there's -- you have some permanent acreage position, my understanding is you're drilling a client horizontal, either Sterling or Glaska [ph]. Can you talk about what you're doing out there? Is that true? And if so, what you\u2019re doing out there?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "I think what you referring to is we've got over 90,000 net acres HBP in our Conger field area. And we have drilled and completed a Penn shale well out there. And we're not going to release results yet. What I can tell you for our very first try, I'm very encouraged by what I've seen so far, and I think the team is as well. But it's early, we need to watch it, and we'll go from there.", "David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay, then, could you give us, Jeff, any color on what your next steps are? Is the Penn or its equivalent prospective over your entire acreage position, or can you just -- can you give us anything else?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes. I can tell you it's prospective over our entire acreage position, so it would be meaningful if it works. If you -- they're oil wells, so you can envision the spacing there. I like talked about the spacing on Tonkawa for their oil wells, even at drilling 12 wells per section, which is \u2013 it\u2019s a squirly number, when you divide it out, it\u2019s 53 acres per well, with 12 wells per section. And the Tonkawa gives you a recovery of no greater than 10% of the oil in place. That's the exciting part, yet we're still generating 100% rate of return either through better technology, better completions, better down spacing, you can get higher recoveries. So if you use that same math in a place like Conger, and you use that same exact spacing, you're talking about, if I just punched it out right, 1,700 wells. So it's impactful, and it could be very meaningful, and it's oil. So that's what we're doing out there.", "John Pinkerton", "Yes. And it's relatively shallow and not all that costly per well too.", "David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay. So just -- I guess, I'm going to keep pressing here, you have plans for the rest of the year out there?", "Jeffrey Ventura", "Yes, for the rest of the year, we're looking at that. We may drill one more well out there, then we'll just watch the production from 1 or 2 wells this year, and then we'll factor in what our program is next year. I think, mainly, we want to understand it, look at the quality and its HBP, and then we'll go from there.", "Operator", "We are at the end of our allotted time for Q&A. Mr. Pinkerton, I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for any closing comments.", "John Pinkerton", "Well, thank you, all, for joining us. I know we're a little bit over, and we had lots of great questions. And I appreciate all those that asked questions. Those were terrific questions. And again, we appreciate everybody joining us. ", "As I mentioned, this is really an exciting time at Range, and we got a lot going on. Even David there who -- I don't know how David does it, but he seems to find out lots of things, so I commend him on that. But we've got a lot going on, and we got a great team, but we're clearly focused and disciplined. And you saw that by our capital spending. We're right on trend with where our capital budget was. And we're going to continue to be disciplined. But it's a really exciting time to be at Range and be a Range shareholder and we couldn't be more happy. ", "But obviously, that's behind us now. Now we got to -- the bar's set high, and we've got to perform next quarter as well. So we'll get off the phone here and get back to work and get that production up and those costs down, and hopefully, we'll have equal, if not better, results next quarter. So again, thank you very much, and we'll see you around. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney L. Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the third quarter with an increase in production and realized prices and a decrease in unit costs. All the key success factors are all moving in the right direction.", "Both Earnings and cash flow per share results were also over First Call consensus. Production at the end of September showed that we had also met our goal of replacing the production sold in the Barnett sale by the end of the third quarter and that being within 5 months. Range ended the quarter with still $52 million in cash and no amounts drawn on the bank facility, demonstrating that cost and spending are right on track.", "Range is prepared to finish out 2011 with again record-setting production volumes and taking that momentum into 2012. I think you'll hear those same themes reiterated from each of our speakers today.", "On the call with me are John Pinkerton, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Ventura, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Before turning the call over to John, I would like to cover a few administrative items. First, we did file our 10-Q with the SEC this morning. It's available on the homepage of our website, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we've posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today. We've also added tables, which will guide you in the forecasting of our future realized prices for natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. Detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter is also available on the website.", "Second, we will be participating in several conferences in November. Check our website for a complete listing for the next several months. We will be at the Morningstar Conference in Chicago on November 10; the Bank of America Energy Conference in Miami on November 15; and the UBS Access Conference in Boston on November 17. In addition, we'll have several teams on the road during November. We hope that we can meet with you personally in the very near future.", "Now let me give the call over to John. John?", "John H. Pinkerton", "Thanks, Rodney. Before Roger reviews the third quarter financial results, I'll review the key accomplishments that we achieved in the third quarter.", "On a year-over-year basis, third quarter production rose 7%, materially exceeding the high end of our guidance due to better-than-expected timing as to infrastructure buildout. Adjusting for the Barnett sale, third quarter 2011 production growth would have been 27% year-over-year. Most importantly, by the end of September, we had fully replaced the production in sold in the Barnett sale. Because the Barnett production represented 20% of our total production at the time of the sale, this represents a tremendous achievement by our operating teams to have replaced the Barnett production in just 5 months as Rodney mentioned. They deserve a big round of applause.", "Our drilling program was on schedule throughout the quarter as we drilled 77 gross wells. We continue to be extremely excited with the drilling results. Despite the low natural gas prices, we continue to generate very attractive rates of return on our drilling. We currently have 21 rigs in operation.", "The 7% increase in production was complemented by a 15% increase in realized prices. As a result, third quarter oil and gas revenues were 15% higher than the prior year. Due to significantly lower unit costs, cash flow was a whopping 35% higher than last year.", "Speaking of costs, we are most pleased on the unit cost performance side. We saw a 9% decrease in our 5 largest cost categories combined. This was the first quarter where we saw a decrease in each of the 5 major cost categories. Most impressively, direct operating cost per Mcf was reduced by 20%, while G&A expense fell 12%.", "With regard to our Marcellus Shale play, significant headway was made in the quarter as we continue to drill fantastic wells, fill out our acreage position and continue to build out infrastructure.", "In particular, the progress made on the infrastructure and marketing fronts has been very impressive. My hat goes off to those teams as well. As a result, we were very well positioned to achieve our 400 million a day net production exit rate target for the Marcellus. Currently, we're approximately 350 million a day in the Marcellus net.", "While our focus for this year has clearly been on the Marcellus, we have quietly built a very high-quality acreage position in horizontal Mississippian play in Northern Oklahoma that now totals 105,000 net acres. We believe the horizontal Mississippian play will be an excellent complement for our Marcellus play.", "All in all, I'm very impressed and very pleased on how much we accomplished in the third quarter. I compliment the entire Range team for a job well done. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger to review the financial results.", "Roger S. Manny", "Thank you, John. From a financial perspective, the first half of 2011 was a transformative period, with the Barnett sale providing significant future funding and substantive improvements in our liquidity and balance sheet. The first half also brought about declining unit costs and increasing production revenue and cash flow.", "For the third quarter, we built upon the favorable trends of the first half with continued top line growth, lower costs and higher production. The primary Barnett sale closing occurred in April, so the third quarter is our first quarter which includes essentially no Barnett activity. And as I've mentioned on previous calls, with the Barnett sale, we're again required to report our financial statements using discontinued operations accounting.", "Our filed financial statements break out the historical results of our Barnett assets as discontinued operations. We've also posted supplemental tables on our website and in the press release that reconcile the discontinued operations results with our historical results that include the Barnett. This information's provided so that investors may more easily compare their prior period projections with our current period results.", "On this call, when referring to historical performance, I'll be referencing the non-GAAP results that include the Barnett matching those used in the press release and supplemental tables.", "Now starting with the income statement, oil and gas revenue, including cash-settled derivatives, totaled $283 million, 15% higher than the third quarter of last year and 6% higher than the second quarter of this year. Behind the revenue increase are higher production and higher prices. Cash flow logged a fifth consecutive quarterly increase, coming in at $190 million in the quarter. That's 35% higher than the third quarter of 2010. Cash flow per share for the third quarter of this year was $1.19, $0.12 above the analyst consensus estimate.", "EBITDAX for the third quarter was $221 million, 28% above last year's third quarter. Cash margin for the third quarter was $3.78 per mcfe, up 26% from last year's third quarter and up 6% from the second quarter of this year due to lower costs and higher prices.", "Third quarter earnings, calculated using analyst methodology, which excludes nonrecurring and noncash items, was $45 million or $0.28 per share, $0.05 above the analyst consensus estimates.", "Cash flow for the 9-month year-to-date period was $529 million, and EBITDAX year-to-date was $620 million, 25% and 23%, respectively, over last year's 9-month figures. These non-GAAP figures are fully reconciled to our GAAP numbers on the supplemental tables posted at the Range website.", "Before moving to the balance sheet, let's walk through the key cost items for the third quarter. Starting with the biggest number, our DD&A rate fell from $1.98 per mcfe last year to $1.89 in the third quarter of this year. Now this $1.89 figure includes several nonrecurring items: one, a $0.07 per mcfe entry to realign the valuations of several properties in the Midcontinent; and two, a $0.03 accelerated depreciation entry on some miscellaneous assets. Adjusting for these 2 items, our core third quarter DD&A rate from continuing operations is $1.79 per mcfe. The fourth quarter is when we roll our year-end reserve report results into the DD&A rate, which should result in a further decrease to our rate.", "Direct operating expense, including workovers and excluding noncash comp, was $0.58 per mcfe in the third quarter. Direct operating unit costs for the third quarter of last year was $0.73, marking a 20% year-over-year decline in this key metric. As John mentioned our operating teams continue to deliver terrific cost productions this year and with the fourth quarter operating expense anticipated to be in the $0.56 to $0.58 range.", "Production taxes, as predicted, fell $0.15 per mcfe in the third quarter. That's down from $0.19 in the third quarter of last year on lower wellhead gas prices and changes in our production mix. We expect production taxes to fall another $0.02 in the fourth quarter.", "G&A expense, adjusted for noncash stock comp and other nonrecurring items, was $0.53 per mcfe, $0.08 below last year's third quarter. While G&A expense was predicted to be a few cents below last quarter, the drop to $0.53 was somewhat unexpected. It was partially related to the timing of several large public relations expenditures.", "Normalized for expense timing, G&A expense is expected to be in the $0.57 to $0.59 per mcfe range in the fourth quarter. Interest expense for the third quarter was up over last year on an absolute basis due to the refinancing of our short-term bank debt with higher cost long-term fixed rate notes. But on a unit cost basis, third quarter interest expense declined from $0.73 per mcfe last year to $0.69 per mcfe this year, and we anticipate interest expense on a unit cost basis to decline another $0.04 during the fourth quarter as our production continues to build at a faster rate than our debt.", "Exploration expense, excluding noncash comp in the third quarter was $17 million, higher than the third quarter of last year due to increased seismic and dry hole expense. And we've got several new seismic projects that are commencing in the last quarter of this year and delay rentals always seem to spike in December. We anticipate exploration expense increase next quarter to between $20 million and $22 million.", "Unproved property abandonment and impairment for the third quarter totaled $17 million. That's down $4 million from the third quarter of last year due to the Barnett sale, and we expect unproved property impairment to run between $17 million and $19 million next quarter.", "Range incurred no current federal income taxes this quarter as our federal income tax obligation for the quarter was deferred. We currently have a $347 million federal tax NOL carryforward and continue to generate large intangible drilling cost deductions due to the ratio of our income to our capital spending. and we expect our federal income taxes to remain deferred, but we'll probably incur state-level income taxes averaging about $1 million a year starting next year.", "All the big balance sheet news was in the first half of 2011. That leaves the third quarter without any major changes. Now we ended the third quarter without any outstanding bank debt and $52 million in cash. However, we will begin to advance against our revolving bank credit facility in the fourth quarter, and as we start to draw down on our credit facility, please remember that we spent the first $538 million of the Barnett proceeds paying off the bank facility. But just because we'll be advancing on the bank facility in the fourth quarter, certainly doesn't mean that we spent all the Barnett proceeds.", "Now speaking of the bank facility, the 28-member Range bank group unanimously reaffirmed the existing $2 billion volume base last week and elected to retain the current $1.5 billion commitment under the facility. Our hedging position remains strong with approximately 74% of our remaining 2011 gas production hedged at a floor price of $4.96. And in 2012, we have approximately 260 million cubic feet per day hedged collars and swaps with an effective floor price of $5.01 per Mmbtu. In 2013, we have 160 million cubic feet per day hedged, using collars at a price of $5.09 by $5.65 per Mmbtu.", "We also have hedges on 7,000 barrels per day of our remaining 2011 liquids production at $104.17 per barrel and 5,000 barrels per day of 2012 liquids hedged at $102.59 per barrel. All the hedge prices I've just mentioned are net of any applicable premium paid when establishing the positions. Additional hedging information may be obtained from the tables attached to the press release and the more detailed hedging tables on the website.", "So with the first half of the Barnett sale and balance sheet improvements behind us, the third quarter built upon the revenue costs and productivity improvements of the second quarter, and we look forward to similar continued progress in the fourth quarter and into next year. John, back to you.", "John H. Pinkerton", "Thanks, Roger. That's a terrific update. Now let's turn the call over to Jeff to review our operations. Jeff?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thanks, John. Range's development of the Marcellus Shale play continues to successfully move forward on all fronts. During the third quarter, 28 wells were brought online in the Southwest part of the play. The peak 24-hour rate to sales for these wells averaged 7.1 million per day. That's comprised of approximately 4.6 million per day of gas and 420 barrels of liquids per day.", "In Lycoming County, 10 wells were brought online and their peak 24-hour rates to sales averaged 9 million per day. Importantly, the infrastructure buildout continues on plan as well.", "In the Southwest, we currently have 390 million per day of dedicated cryogenic gas processing capacity. We also currently have access to another 100 million per day of interruptible processing capacity. Gathering and compression for the processing capacity is planned to be built to stay ahead of our needs in this area. ", "In the dry gas area of the Southwest, we currently have 40 million per day of gas gathering and compression capacity, which is on track to be expanded to 80 million per day by year end. In Lycoming County, we currently have 90 million per day of gathering capacity with plans to increase that capacity to 150 million per day by year end. Additional compression will be added as needed.", "For Southwest Pennsylvania, we currently have commitments for over 420 million per day to transport natural gas to market either with Range-owned firm transportation or firm sales arrangements with customers who hold firm transportation. Transportation commitments in the Southwest are planned increase to 550 million per day during 2012 to accommodate the expected increase in production from the region.", "In the Northeast, along the Transco-Leidy transmission line, we currently have commitments of 80 million per day, increasing to 100 million per day during 2012 in the form of firm sales arrangements with customers owning existing firm sales transportation on Transco and storage at Leidy. We believe that our existing firm sales arrangements both in the Southwest and Northeast can further be increased as we demonstrate that additional production volumes are available.", "For the third quarter, Range's bases in the Southwest area of the Marcellus continue to be flat to a positive $0.08 per Mcf range, above the NYMEX Henry Hub index price. In the Northeast, along the Transco-Leidy transmission system, our bases for the third quarter continue to be in the positive $0.10 to 15% range above the NYMEX Henry Hub index price. Range has ramped up volumes in the play from $100 million per day net exit rate in 2009 to 200 million per day net exit rate in 2010, and we're currently on plan to exit 2011 at 400 million per day net.", "We're currently growing volumes, and as Roger has just mentioned, we're driving down our unit costs. At the same time, our marketing team is doing an excellent job of not only selling our gas but doing so at good relative prices.", "The achievements above are the result of having a really talented technical team that works well together and being the first mover in the play combined with long-term vision and planning. Said another way, it's a culmination of analyzing data, acting quickly and handling ourselves and business in a way that would make our parents proud. Specifically, having our operations and marketing groups work well together early on in the play has resulted in Range being able to receive higher sales prices due to the following accomplishments.", "Early on, we worked with MarkWest, who is already the largest liquid company in the basin. This allowed us to fill existing capacity that they had at Salem, Kentucky and also to build new infrastructure and capacity.", "Early on, we obtained necessary gas quality waivers from pipelines to delay taking ethane out of the gas until market could be developed. The first ethane project is now moving forward and others will follow. We realized that the Marcellus was a different animal in size early on and contracted for key capacity on pipes at lower rates than was currently available. We were also able to negotiate long-term sales contracts with key capacity holders on the system at terms that were favorable to both parties.", "Importantly, we started in Southwest Pennsylvania because we knew there was a better market and more pipeline capacity, especially in the summertime, and we also realized that liquids were very valuable.", "Lastly, we had a philosophy of more than one sales meter into diversion interstate pipelines or local markets, which allows us to move gas around to maximize flow in price. Being first in the play and believing in it quickly allowed us to execute deals early on before others could get to their feet under them.", "Let me give a little more technical detail about the Marcellus before moving on to another division. In the Northeast portion of the play, we brought online our first 5 horizontal wells in the first quarter of this year. On the second quarter call, I said that our average estimated ultimate recovery for those 5 wells is 6 Bcf. The average lateral length of the wells is 2,573 feet with a 9 stage frac. Those wells are performing better than expected, and our currently estimate for those 5 wells has been revised upward to 6.5 Bcf per well.", "For the first 5 wells, that's very encouraging. Looking at the EURs on a per lateral length or per stage basis, these are outstanding wells. We're running our own analysis of various lateral lengths and frac stages, and we're also looking at the results of other operators. Currently, we're completing a 4,500 foot lateral with 15 stages in Lycoming County. By year end, we plan on drilling a 5,000 foot lateral there.", "In the Southwest wet area, we have frac-ed a 3,950 foot lateral with 20 stages and 2 wells that each had 22 frac stages and 3,350 foot laterals. Most likely, we'll discuss all 5 wells during the fourth quarter conference call, since by then, we should have longer-term production results for this group of wells.", "In the Upper Devonian, we'll be spudding our third well into this formation beginning early in the second quarter of 2012. This well will target the wet gas portion of the play and will be drilled into the area with what we expect to be the highest combined gas and liquids content in place. In terms of liquids content, we expect the Upper Devonian will be like the Marcellus Shale. Where the Marcellus is wet, the Upper Devonian should be wet. Where the Marcellus is dry, the Upper Devonian should be dry. I also want to point out that the first 2 wells continue to perform well.", "In the Utica Shale, we'll spud our next well in the second quarter of 2012. Industry has drilled and will be drilling several Utica wells. Results of some of these wells will help us to delineate Range's acreage. A lot of our acreage is perspective for both the Upper Devonian and Utica shale. We hold all depth rights on our fairway acreage, so as we focus on driving up reserves and production in the low-risk highly economic Marcellus play, we'll hold the Upper Devonian and Utica potential both above and below the Marcellus. As we better understand the other 2 horizons with time, we'll then determine the optimum plan for each horizon.", "Moving over to the Midcontinent Division, I'll start with the discussion of our horizontal Mississippian play. To date, excluding one very short lateral, we have drilled and completed 8 horizontal wells with an average lateral length of 2,197 feet with 12 frac stages. Our current average estimated ultimate recovery for these wells is 485,000 barrels of oil equivalent. We now have 105,000 net acres in the play, which equates to approximately 2,000 potential well locations. If we keep drilling with roughly 2,000 foot laterals, we believe it will take 12 wells per section to develop the reserves. That equates to a little over 50 acre spacing. Assuming that the average recovery of 485,000 barrel holds, that's a recovery factor of 4% to 9% of the oil in place. I believe that to compare the estimate of ultimate recovery per well between operators or between areas, you have to attempt to factor in the lateral length and frac stages to get somewhat of an apples-to-apples comparison.", "We will observe how longer laterals are doing in other areas and what the costs are to drill and complete those types of wells. We also tried different lateral lengths and different types of completion ourselves. We'll be seeking the solution that generates the best project economics, not the highest IP or best ultimate recovery. If the optimum lateral length is longer, say, 4,000 feet instead of 2,000 feet, then the number of wells per section would most likely decrease from 12 to 6, and the spacing per well would increase from over 50 acres to over 100 acres per well.", "Of course, the advantage of this play, like the Marcellus, is that there's a lot of hydrocarbon in place. Given the strong technical team that we have, coupled with industry's track record of driving up the recovery factor with time, I believe that's what we'll see happen here as well. Typically, the higher recovery factor comes from down spacing and better completions.", "Up in the Texas Panhandle, we had excellent success with our first horizontal St. Louis well. It came online at 13.8 million per day and 903 barrels of liquids or the equivalent of about 19.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day. After producing for about 9 months, it's still making about 11.2 million per day and 694 barrels of liquids or 15.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 4.7 million net. So far, this well has produced 3.3 Bcf of gas, 138,000 barrels of NGLs and 76,000 barrels of condensate. The payout was within weeks.", "Since then, we've completed 2 more wells for a combined rate of 24.4 million per day of gas and 1,394 barrels of liquids per day or 28.8 million per day gross or 13.1 million per day net. We'll be drilling 2 additional horizontal St. Louis wells this year and have identified other prospects, which we plan to drill in 2012.", "To summarize, operationally, I think the team is getting the right kind of results. They're driving up production and reserves while driving down costs. We're continuing to build new infrastructure, gathering and compression for each new pad, so there's still a lot of efforts to get every new 10 million per day on production. Therefore, timing and logistics are still critical factors in the growing production. However, we're learning how to resolve those issues and accelerate our development plans. We're continuing to work on our plans for 2012, which we'll submit to our Board of Directors in December. I believe our shareholders will like what we're planning for 2012.", "At this point, I'll turn the call back over to John. I'll be happy to answer your questions in the Q&A.", "John H. Pinkerton", "Thanks, Jeff. Nice update. Looking to the fourth quarter of 2011, we see continued strong operating results. For the fourth quarter, we're looking for production to average 608 million a day on equivalent basis. Assuming we hit our guidance for the quarter, it will represent a 12% year-over-year increase. Adjusting for the Barnett sale, the year-over-year increase jumps up to 43%.", "For the entire year of 2011, we have increased our production guidance target from 10% to 11%. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to exit 2011 with the Marcellus Shale production at 400 million a day net and with total company exiting at roughly 650 million a day net.", "As noted in our release, we currently anticipate capital spending for 2012 to total $1.47 billion, which is $90 million or 6.5% higher than our beginning of the year budget. The budget increase was not related to service cost inflation. It is directly related to costs associated with nonoperative drilling operations in the Marcellus, Ardmore Woodford, Cana Woodford plays as well as additional leasehold acquisitions costs and the horizontal Mississippian play in Northern Oklahoma.", "So far this year, we have participated in 47 nonoperated wells. As Roger mentioned, the third quarter provides a very good picture of Range post the Barnett sale. In many respects, the third quarter was one of the best quarterly performances in the company's history. Production far exceeded guidance. Unit costs decreased significantly. Margins expanded. Cash flow increased 35%, and earnings more than doubled, and we ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet, with $52 million of invested cash and no outstandings on our $2 billion bank credit facility.", "The good news is that the fourth quarter should be even better than the third quarter. Fourth quarter production is expected to jump roughly $70 million a day over the third quarter. As noted earlier on an apples-to-apples basis, adjusting for the Barnett sale, fourth quarter productions anticipate to be 43% higher than the prior period. That's a significant increase. At the same time that we're accelerating our production growth, we anticipate further reductions in our unit costs in the fourth quarter.", "All in all, the fourth quarter results should give our shareholders a good view of what 2012 should look like. Despite a lower commodity price outlook, we anticipate 2012 revenues, EBITDAX, cash flow and earnings to far exceed those of 2011. We see 2012 as a breakout year for Range.", "As just discussed, our operating teams are continuing to enhance and improve our well results while maintaining our solid safety record. In addition, Jeff discussed the tremendous progress our infrastructure and marketing teams have also achieved. The challenge is not only defined in the developed reserves at low cost but also to have low operating transportation costs and to market your production in an efficient and competitive way. Our third quarter results indicate that we're doing an excellent job in all these areas. While clearly biased, I'm convinced we have an exceptional asset base and drilling inventory as well as an exceptional team of people driving our performance from the drill bit to the burner tip. Our management team is keenly focused on enhancing our asset base and improving our team's performance.", "Selling our Barnett Shale properties was somewhat of a bold move, as the Barnett properties comprised 20% of our production at the time. However, we believe it best served Range's shareholders, as it provides a clear path for capital funding and allows our shareholders to retain 100% of our 40 to 56 Tcfe of current resource potential.", "From an investor's point of view, I believe Range is somewhat of a unique proposition. Because of our high-quality drilling inventory and low-cost structure, we can generate attractive returns even at today's low natural gas prices. This provides substantial downside protection.", "On the other hand, because of the extraordinary resource potential of the Marcellus Shale and our other projects, we have one of the largest per share upsides of any company in our peer group. With the Barnett production now fully replaced, our growth will accelerate sharply. Combining the fourth quarter growth rate with lower unit costs will have a big impact on our fourth quarter results, our 2012 results and our net asset value per share.", "We appreciate the support and guidance and confidence that our shareholders have shown us, and we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2011 with great anticipation. ", "With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dave Kistler from Simmons and Company.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Real quickly. Just kind of a housekeeping item. Can you break out of the $100 million increase in CapEx, give or take, how that was broken up between higher nonoperating costs and leaseholds?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, it was -- about $110 million of the increase was due to the -- excuse me, of the $90 million. It was -- if you're looking at probably about 25 leases and the rest was capital.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then based off commentary, obviously things are going very well in the Marcellus niche line, your St. Louis wells and then from your release, Nora wells as well. Can you talk a little bit about with strong activity in all those areas, how we should we think about capital being deployed next year? As John mentioned previously, he said the majority of capital was directed to the Marcellus. Will that break down differently next year? And while you can't give us the numbers specifically on that CapEx, directionally, I would imagine it's higher with that many attractive things in the portfolio.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, I mean, we're still putting together our program for next year. We'll present it to the board in December. And with the new total of 1.47 billion, you're looking at -- the breakout by division would be 86% Marcellus, 6% Midcon, 4% Pine Mountain and 4% Southwest. Although it's early, directionally, it'll probably be very similar to that. Granted, it may go up or down a little bit between divisions. But you're still going to see big focus in the Marcellus, probably the biggest change next years. And when we put it in our release, you'll know ultimately we'll probably have a couple of rigs drilling horizontal, Mississippian wells in the Midcontinent and a program with both.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then one last one, obviously, you've had attractive production gains on a per well basis, but if I recall correctly, you've had pretty significant efficiency gains as well on the drilling and completion side. Can you guys just kind of give us an example from first of the year to where we are to date in terms of what kind of upticks you've had in drilling efficiency gains and completion efficiency gains in the Marcellus?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "One thing I would say is we talked about all along, and I think about this on the last call, but in a development mode, ultimately, in the Southwest to get the 4 million per day. We just signed a pack of AFEs yesterday. The wells on those development wells in the Southwest that are 8 or 9 stages and that 2,500 to 3,000 foot, they're right at basically about 4 million. So we have achieved that number. Importantly in the Northeast, since we just started this year drilling, talked about in the development mode, we'd get the 5.2 million. The earlier wells this year were probably 6 million, plus or minus. Talking to Mike Middlebrook and Mark Whitley just this morning, but more recent AFEs, currently, up there 5.4 million for wells again that have about that same type of completion. So that's pretty great progress in a relatively short period of time to approach that development mode number. So what makes me excited is then looking forward -- again, and I've said this before, but I think 1 of 2 things will happen. We put out all of our horizontal wells that we've ever drilled by program here in the form of a 0 time plot, and what you've seen year after year after year is those numbers climb north. Hopefully, through continued optimization, you'll see improvement in terms of the reserve per well as we continue to update that. After year end, we'll do that again. As I just mentioned, in the Northeast, we've gone from 6 Bs per well to 6.5 Bs per well in a relatively short period of time just because the wells are declining less and producing better than that forecast. And then going the other way, once we lock down on an optimum design and we've got literally thousands of wells to drill, I think our team will really get better on the cost side as well with time.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "So just to kind of clarify a little bit, while you've hit that target cost in the Southwest and you're darn close in the Northeast, do you expect to actually come in below those now looking froward?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I think if we kept that same design year after year after year, then we would, clearly, I think break those numbers and come in lower, which is a huge upside. And if 2 or 3 years out, we kept that same design but we can knock $0.5 million off per well, which isn't unrealistic over that time frame, and you do that over 5,000 wells or 10,000 wells, you're talking $2.5 billion to $5 billion. But relatively on the front end of a projects, it fully would positively affect the economics. The other thing to remember though, I also said we have a lot of experiments, and I talked about the longer laterals or even moderate laterals but with a high number of stages, so you're breaking up more rock. To the extent we do that, those wells are more expensive, then the question is does the higher capital generate a higher rate of return, and do we ultimately shift some of our drilling in particular areas that way. The jury is still out, but the good news is whether you look at it as we keep the same design, we have really strong rates of return doing what we're doing today. If we keep the same design, there's upside that they can get better, or if we go to some of the higher density stage fracs or longer laterals with more stages, that also can improve rate of return. I think either way, we can do better than what we're doing today, and what we're doing today is great.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Looking at your exit rate guidance of 650 for the total company and 400 for the Marcellus, implies about 250 million a day coming outside the Marcellus, which is a decent step-up from what was just slightly north of 200 million for the third quarter. Does this represent an inflection point here in non-Marcellus production? Can you just add a little bit more color on whether that's backlog of wells, whether it's some of the strong St. louis wells that you just mentioned in your comments and a breakdown between the Mississippian and other plays?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, I would say, when you look at the Midcontinent Division, those guys have done a great job. So even though they're allocated not a lot of capital this year, they're being very efficient with their capital. When you drill high-rate wells like that in the St. Louis, you're getting really good growth for not a lot of capital, coupled with what they've done in the horizontal Mississippian. So I think the guys up there are doing more with less, and they're showing the quality of some of those plays. Same with the team that we have in Virginia, in the Southern Appalachian basin. Even though they're not allocated a lot of capital, they're still getting growth with the dollars that they're spending. So I think the guys in the other divisions are doing a good job, and it shows the -- even though we're focused on the Marcellus, by clearing away, that's our -- John mentioned, we have 40 to 56 Tcf of upside. Just in the Marcellus, it's 22 to 32. But what that means, we have good growth in the other areas as well, so we've got high-quality portfolio.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So I guess should we look at this as a run rate of incremental 40-plus million cubic feet a day? Or is there kind of some backlog of wells coming on? Or should we expect these increases, again, x Marcellus to be a bit more spotty?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, I think you're going to see -- we haven't set our budget for '12 yet. Part of that depends on how we allocate it. But to the extent we go to program drilling in the horizontal Mississippian and if we can continue that early success that we have, then those guys will be able to continue to drive up production. And again, I would think the spending level in Virginia is probably will be similar, although the board, we haven't presented and they haven't approved the budget yet. So you're looking at probably very modest growth there.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then as you look ahead into next year, how are you thinking about future asset sales? And is that something that's going to be a priority for 2012?", "John H. Pinkerton", "Brian, John. I think we've done -- the Barnett really was, I think the inflection point and that it really, from our perspective, it kind of completely reloaded us in terms of, in our minds, having a clear path in terms of capital funding and in terms of self funding. So -- and we look at that as kind of the big guy. There's some other things that we will look at from time to time, and we sold some Mississippian asset this quarter. I think we sold some assets down in East Texas, and we sold a few other little assets, some CBM, some very shallow kind of marginal CBM assets in Pennsylvania, so we'll continue to look at some of that. And then we've got a few other little projects that we're looking at that either people come to us or we've gone out to people that we believe would have an interest in it, and Chad Stephens and our A&D team are doing a tremendous job of just looking at that and figuring out what we're going to do. My gut feel is over the next couple of -- or let's say between now and the end of next year, I would think that we'd be somewhere in the, if you want you to pin me down a number, probably somewhere in the $50 million to $100 million, maybe $150 million range  of additional asset sales, of things that we're looking at. But again, I think the key is, is that one of the things we're really focused on at Range is really driving up NAV per share. And to the extent that if somebody were to come in and offer us a great price for a particular asset, we're going to take a hard look at it, and if we can then take those dollars and then reallocate it into other projects and accelerate that NAV, we're going to jump on those opportunities and try to do that. So we're in good shape. We don't have to do the asset sales, but to the extent that we do them, we've got place to put the capital and really ramp up our -- continue to ramp up our NAV.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Scialla from Stifel, Nicholas.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask on the Upper Devonian, I know you said your next test there you plan in the second quarter and it just seems to me that, that 10 to 14 Tcf is a big number obviously. Any -- do you feel any pressure there to go any faster to delineate that asset? I would think you'd need to kind of see how real that 10 to 14 number is in terms of how you want to lay out your infrastructure for the development of Southwest Pennsylvania.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I sort of view it as a 2-step process. I think if you go by the end of 2012, I think we'll have a lot more indications of what that is, and step one is just understanding it. We talked about just moving rigs into the center of the thick wet part and drilling them now. What we talked about operational is that there's sort of march in there a little bit, and that way, when -- other than drilling them and getting them a short-term test, we can actually drill them and put them online, which is much more meaningful data. To the extent we derisk, we can come back to the market and talk about the quality of the wells and the results, and particularly, if we can demonstrate a nice wet area like there is in the Marcellus, I think then, people will start giving us some value. The second stage is then how do you optimally develop that, and it depends on the quality of the wells and what we find. But -- so I think we're on track towards getting there. When we put our budget together, we'll have probably on the order of 5, 6, 7 wells in the Upper Devonian, and we'll test some of those better wells in 2012. So I think by the end of '12, we'll have that. And to the extent we can get in there a little quicker, we will. But we're trying to set it up, so when we drill them, we actually can bring them online.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I guess along those same lines, it looks like the backlog of uncompleted wells or wells waiting on completion in the Marcellus continues to kind of go up. And just wondering how do you view that number over the next 12 months. And is the gating factor there really to access the completion crews? Or is it more on the gathering side?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "It's probably more on the pipeline build-out and gathering. When we -- by the end of the year, we'll have the next phase of Lycoming County done, and that will bring a slug of the wells on. But remember, we've got such an attractive acreage position that really, across that whole fairway, looks like it's working. As we bring new areas on, you'll see the production come up, but as we step out and test and have success, you may see a little backlog again. So there'll probably be a little bit of a wave up and down. The good news is you go back to where we started, it's not only has it worked. It's worked across a broader area than I think most people expected, and the quality of the wells is much higher than what most people expected, to where now, I think, most people recognize the best gas play in the U.S. is that and particularly if you are in the wet area, which we are and we dominate, it stacks up well really versus any play out there in the U.S., including a lot of the oil plays, if not, all of them.", "John H. Pinkerton", "Yes, I mean, Mike, just to kind of tie on to what Jeff said, I think you're right. I think it was not as good intuitive view of it. I think it has gone up a bit but I think we are going to put a big slug of wells on towards the end of the year in particularly in the Lycoming County. And then we have another pad in the Southwest PA that we're putting on, assuming we can get the Corp of Engineers out of our hair. That should come on later in the year as well. So that's going to bring it back down a bit, and I think, plus or minus, as Jeff said, I think it will stay pretty stable from there on out.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And, Jeff, you gave quite a bit of detail on your firm transportation agreements and your realized price. I guess one of your neighbors in particular, I guess maybe a couple to the north have talked about some basis widening to NYMEX, at least, for their realized price. It didn't sound like from your comments that you anticipate that. But can you talk in general about where you see that basis going and maybe the risk for the whole play given the growth potential for the Marcellus?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, let me start, and I'm sure some of my colleagues around the table will chime in. But I think the good news is we have a big position, 550,000 acres in the Southwest, another 240,000 in the Northeast for the numbers that have out, so we've got big positions across the play. And like I had mentioned, when you're in the Southwest part of the play, you just have better infrastructure in general and better ability to move the gas around, plus being the first mover and having a really good team, looking far ahead, we were able to capture a lot of things to where we can not only move our gas and sell our gas, but do so at a good price. And then out in Lycoming County, as you market, as you go as far as you can to the Northeast, throughout  Bradford County and some of those areas, it's -- obviously, it's a lot more difficult to move gas, and that's where you've seen the people selling gas for less than $1. Range's focus is primarily in the Southwest, but a big position in Lycoming County and coming to the Southeast of there. So where our gas is located has an advantage, and like I said, being the first mover has an advantage. If you look farther out, we've talked about, currently we're at about 350 million per day net, with the ability given tremendous upside we have at 22 to 32 Ts of having the opportunity if that continues to drill out to maybe hit 1 Bcf per day, 1.5 Bcf, 2 Bs per day, potentially 3 Bs per day over time. And we just had a giant marketing meeting yesterday with the entire team and getting everybody together, and my biggest concern or our biggest concern is can we move Range's 3 Bs per day. If we can -- or 3 and that could be beyond that, we've got the opportunity to grow our rates in the Marcellus tenfold, let alone, reserves tenfold. That's really what concerns me. A lot of people talk about what can the play do we overall. I'm most concerned about can Range move our gas and do so for a good price. I feel bad for my brethren that give a lesser for their gas or they can't move theirs. But we can create a lot value for our shareholders if we can drive up our -- stay focused, stay disciplined, drive up our production per share and reserves per share like we have been doing. I think at the end of the day, the good news about the Marcellus is we're in the highest quality gas play with the lowest breakeven price located in the best area. We'll always have an advantage in terms of transportation, so those are some broader thoughts, but...", "John H. Pinkerton", "Yes. Let me -- yes, this is John. A couple of things. I'll bring it back down a few thousand feet. What's interesting about the Marcellus more than a lot of the shale plays, in particular in the Barnett, which is we're headquartered in Fort Worth, so we saw it first hand is that there wasn't a lot of large pipeline systems in and around the Forth Worth basin when that play started. So all that had to be built out, including the big, big trunk lines that -- in particular, the big trunk line that [indiscernible] out of the Barnett. The Marcellus is different in that there is a number of very large transmission systems that run right through the middle of the play, so instead of having to build giant pipelines that go hundreds of miles, that cost billions and billions of dollars, what you're really having to build out are the toll roads -- or not so much the road, but the entry ramps on in and out of those big, big transmission systems. So that's really what's going on. That really gives the Marcellus a huge leg up compared to some of the other shale plays. Obviously, the other huge leg up is that the Marcellus is located in the best parts of the United States to sell gas, which is in the Northeast, so that's a huge upside as well. So again, I think -- and the other thing obviously, the whole industry we need to focus on, we found a heck of a lot of gas there. We need to work on the demand side and increase the demand side, and I think as an industry, we're starting to do that. And I'm seeing a lot of really good positive things both in terms of electric generation and also in transportation fuels. And yes, this is going to take a matter of time. The other thing I think, again, just going back down a little bit is that if you really think through some of the issues up in Appalachia in terms of some of the -- of our brethren that have gotten some pretty low prices, it all comes back to you've got to be able to built out your gathering and your compression. That's one thing. The second thing you've got to do in the Southwest, you've got to be able to process it. The other thing you need to do is be able to -- once you get on those big pipeline systems, there's a multitude of different ways of getting on those big transmission systems, and some people will take what they believe is the less expensive way out by not getting firm transportation, but in -- as we've seen, they paid a huge price for that. We've got really good marketing team, and we've got all the firm transportation, as Jeff mentioned, that we need to ramp our production way through 2012, '13 and '14, and they've done a really, really good job of getting all that firm transportation there at really reasonable cost, and they've done a really good job. These are -- our team has been up there for a long time, and they've been in Appalachia. They know what they're doing. They know the white hat from the black hat guys. These were not people to have to kind of get up to speed, and they've really done a tremendous job, and so that's why our basis is holding up. I think it will continue to hold up through the play because they've just done a really good job, and we've got those contracts in place to move it on those big transmission pipes. The other thing that's going to happen is you're going to see as the Marcellus -- continues, I think we're at -- they think we'll -- at least our analysis of it, the play will be over 4 Bs a day by year end, such huge ramp-up. We think you'll start seeing gas move out of the basin over time, over the next few years. You're going to see a lot of -- gas can go both ways, and you're going to see gas going out of the basin in a lot bigger volumes than you've ever seen, and again, the good new is, is all those transmission systems are in place to do that. We don't have to build a bunch of transmission systems. It's just really the access to get it on and off. On a relative basis, the Marcellus is well set up to be able to really get after that. Obviously, what we need is a better economy, better gas demand, in general, from industrial, and then we need an administration that actually embraces natural gas versus kicking us in the gutter, but we'll work on that as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ron Mills from Johnson Rice.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "Jeff, question on the Mississippian Lime. You and John both talked about or at least, the press release, 2 rigs next year. What's the expectation in terms of timing of the startup? And can you just describe -- put a little bit more background on what you're doing now from an infrastructure standpoint to get prepared in terms of saltwater disposal wells and systems and how many Mississippian Limes you think -- well, lime wells you think can tie in to each saltwater disposal well just to get a sense of that development plan.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, one thing you have to remember is how we got started in the play. We got started in the play roughly 5 years ago, plus or minus. We started up there and we started reactivating an old field called the Tonkawa field, and I'll recreate the history. It was the biggest light oilfield back in the 20s, pretty much depleted by the 30s. We went back in and started drilling Tonkawa wells, which were about 2,700 feet deep. That worked out real well. We ended shooting in 3D, and that's really what got us started in drilling the deeper horizons, deep being the Mississippian Lime and below. And we drilled some great verticals well, and then stepped out and --  so, we have a number of vertical wells and we have the 8 horizontal wells, and they're all producing. So we have our saltwater disposal wells in there, and we have capacity already. We're actually probably going to pick up one of those rigs maybe later this year. So we may spud a well sometime in late November. So a second rig, we're still working on. We'll probably have another saltwater disposal well to set up before we start drilling. So we're already selling gas. We're selling oil up there. We're disposing the water. The guys are preplanning for that 2-rig program now, so they're going to hit the ground running. The good news there is the horizontal Mississippian is somewhere on the order of 4,000, 4,500 feet true vertical depth. Below that, you have the Arbuckle. The Arbuckle wells are very prolific saltwater disposal wells, and those are 5,500 feet or so, plus or minus. And those wells can take 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 barrels of water per day barrels per well. So it depends on how prolific your horizontal well are and how hard you pull them, but you can put several producers into a single disposal. We've got a team that's worked that area for a long, long time. They have -- so we've been up there working it really since 2004 specifically. But I think we have guys there who have been working in the basin forever, so they know how to produce oil dispose of water and sell gas and process gas and they're working the well ahead. So I'm excited about what that is. They've done a great job of putting together a pretty blocky acreage position that we feel is one of the best areas out there.", "John H. Pinkerton", "Ron, [indiscernible] this is John, is that just a week or so ago, we executed a midstream agreement with a private midstream company. Once you produce oil, you're going produce gas, high Btu gas and you produce water. On the high Btu gas side, we've just executed a midstream agreement with the company to help build out the -- with them, their balance sheet  but build out the gathering system and also process the gas and extract the liquids, something that our marketing team has already done. That contract's in place. It's already been executed and they're already out there digging ditches and putting pipe in the ground and getting ready to build a cryogenic plant to help do that. So again, the team -- it all comes back, so you've got to have a team concept here. It takes, as I mentioned, you not only -- you got to find the reserves at low prices, but you got to produce and then you got to figure out how to market all the stuff. And the good news is that we kind of learned that in a big way in the Marcellus. We put a big team together on the marketing and infrastructure side, we've done the same thing in Oklahoma, and we've got a great team there, too. So that's really good. The One thing I also want to mention is that as -- when you're really sitting kind of where Jeff and I and Roger are is one of the things you're concerned of when you start off a new play like this and 100,000 acres is a lot of acreage, we can drill thousands of wells, is do we have the talent and the management and the technical team in place to be able both do the Marcellus and then start ramping up the Mississippian. And I think Jeff made a really good point is that we've up there. We got a team in Oklahoma City, and the good news is that team has done a good job, knowing the St. Louis with the Mississippian Lime. And so the team that's working on those projects in Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle is a completely separate team from the team that's working the Marcellus -- and so that's really good. I think -- I'm just looking at my headcount here. We've got about 102 people that work out of that Oklahoma City office. So you can see we've got -- and it's headed by Greg Kline [ph] and his whole team and Max [ph] and the others there, a really good type quality team. As Jeff mentioned, have been there years and years and years and been Range for years and years. So we're excited about it. I'm rooting for them because I think it's going to be a great play and it's really going to be a good complement because it's primarily oil. And so we've found enough gas for a while, so I think it's really going to complement us, and again, as you look forward, things through kind of Range and building out margins and all the things they're going to do in terms of NAV, it's really going to -- I think it's going to be fun to watch this project and see it tick off. I'm really rooting for them.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And one follow-up, just on the acreage. Obviously, your lease acquisition there has accelerated in the past 3 to 6 months and not as much activity/news flow kind of east of the Nemaha Ridge, although that sounds like that may be starting to change particularly next year. Can you just give a lay of the land of east of the ridge versus west of the ridge where other operators started developing the play earlier? Is east of the ridge more dominated by smaller mom and pops types privates, and so there's still ample acreage acquisition opportunities? Or is that also just starting to become more tightly held?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, I'd say one thing. We are on the ridge. So you have that whole area that's been defined and there's different mats out there. So there's -- you can go west of the ridge, on the ridge or east of the ridge. It's interesting -- and I saw somebody put a map out to just look at historical vertical wells out there. If you look at where the best historical, vertical oil wells are, that's where range's acreage is. Somebody asked me offline, why do your wells -- it's early on and granted, can we hold it up? And as we drill, we will continue to see those results, but why are your wells look so good for the -- why you're getting the 485,000 barrels for 2,000 foot lateral, while other people are drilling 4,000 foot laterals and their reserves are in the same range? And if you look at the historical vertical wells or where the best wells are, that's where are our acreage is in and around. So it's necessarily east of the ridge or west of the ridge. It can be on the ridge or there's -- just like in all of these plays, where your acreage is really matter. It's true in the Marcellus, and again, I got to say it because I'm excited about it because we've got a great position, but it's great having a dominant position in the southwest part of the play where the liquids are, where you get a lot of high-quality wells. It's great being in the Mississippian play that we have, obviously in the right area. The St. Louis play, those guys clearly have picked some really good perspective. St. Louis acreage given -- is evidenced by the quality of the well, so where you are in all these plays are what matters.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "And then one on the Marcellus. I mean I think you had mentioned you have 21 rigs total right now. Can -- could you break down how many are in the Marcellus? And then of those, how many are busy performing pad development drilling versus moving around acreage from an maintenance program?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Okay. In the Midcontinent, we currently have one rig drilling. It's drilling the horizontal St. Louis. We have 3 rigs drilling at Pine Mountain, finishing out their program for the year, Pine Mountain being Virginia. We have at least 17 rigs in the Marcellus of which 3 are with Talisman. They're outside operated, so currently and we have -- so that leaves 14 rig that we operate, 9 in the Southwest, 5 in the Northeast. Actually, right now there's 4 in the Northeast. There's one air rig that was just popped in there temporarily. So when you look at that -- and this is the good position we're in. Again, going back to that 550,000 acres in the Southwest, currently, over 90% of that is derisked, and that's derisked of by over 1,000 wells by Range and industry with production dating back to 2005. So it's not like we're running around HBP-ing acreage, to HBP acreage. We're HBP-ing acreage as we're driving up production and reserves and driving down costs with rates of return at strip pricing and they're in out pitch book. You're looking to 80% to 100% type rates of return, depending on what price deck you pick. That being said, you are right and correct and that periodically, we'll jump into some of the new areas, which I mentioned earlier this year is 35 miles away. That acreage, people get lost. Just in Washington County, we have approximately 300,000 net acres. When you think of a county, that's a big area. So a lot of people get lost in the size and the scale of the project. So even though a lot the areas is derisked, our acreage is derisked, it's across a big area, so periodically, we're stepping out 20 miles, 30 miles, 40 miles and drill a well or 2 or 3, and what helps us do then is plan and bring in gathering at system and ultimately, compression so that we can produce it. It's sort of -- not that I'm evading what you're asking, but I mean, we're driving up production while we're with our rigs, at the same time stepping out and testing things. So it's sort of mixed in there, and while we're doing all that, we're holding acreage.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, and then one, just I know you talked about this every once in a while, but you still have the legacy position in the Permian. Any plans to continue to test the horizontal Penn Shale or Wolfcamp Shale? Or is that really more back burner as you focus on Mississippian Lime and the Marcellus in the near term?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "We have an interesting legacy position there, and in the Penn Shale, we talked about -- we have over 90,000 acres HBP in our Conger area. In fact, we've added to a little acreage around the fringe. we're probably over 100,000 net acres there today. So we've got a great position there. We drilled our Penn Shale well and on that first -- well, to back up, for those of you who haven't heard the story, we drilled a couple of vertical wells there a few years ago and we found oil in them. They were vertical wells, not very commercial, but it confirmed we had a nice, thick Penn Shale section saturated with oil. We came back and we drilled a horizontal well earlier this year, and I'm pretty excited about the well. It's early on, but for our first try out there, we got a pretty reasonable well. It wasn't a very long lateral. It was not a lot of stages. I'm sort of looking to John and Rodney here I have the rates in front of me. I'm debating whether I should just say what they are or if we should hold that back. It's pretty exciting from -- I mean, given the way we drilled and completed it, we made a pretty reasonable well. In fact, we're going to spud a second well here probably in November. We'll move about 10 miles way, drill a second well, delineate it, and we've got a good position. There's no question there's oil in it. It's interesting some of our brethren now are out there with buildings Penn Shale position and these are shale players in and around it. Again, it talks about the portfolio, and again, it's oil, so it's a balance against gas. It's HBP acreage. There's no pressure to drill it. It's at a reasonable depth, 8,500 feet, plus or minus, so it has a lot things going for us. The shale there ranges from 270 to 330 feet fixed, so it's nice fixed section. That was a little -- hopefully, that's a little more detailed than what I talked about before.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rehan Rashid from FBR Capital Markets.", "Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Real quick on the Marcellus again. Jeff, what recovery factors are being implied in the, call it, that 5.7 and 6.5 Bcf in the Southwest and Northeast? And kind of the latest wells are trending higher than that, I know you mentioned the beginning. But what will it take in terms of data to move the EURs possibly higher?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "That's a great question. When we talk about those kinds of recoveries, you're really looking at a recovery factor that's about 30%, plus or minus. And when you look at plays -- other plays that have more history, like the Barnett and you look at the better parts and the higher quality parts of the Barnett, I think, people have reported recovery factors of up to 50% of the hydrocarbon in place. So given that I personally -- I believe what I think we could show people and most people would accept it, the quality of rock in the Marcellus is higher than the quality of the rock in the Barnett. That's why -- and you look at the best part of the Barnett, where you're looking at an entire county, you're looking at roughly 3 Bs per well on average. And now most people reporting in the Marcellus numbers that are a lot higher than that, so you're getting higher quality rocks or better performance. I think the recovery factors, in time, will come up.  I don't think they're going to stay at 30%. It will come up either through performance, one, is what's driven it up. Better completions would be 2, and then tighter spacing ultimately would be 3. So I think in time you'll see that come up. That's the beauty of the position that we have when we say there's 22 to 32 Tcf of upside in the Marcellus, the bias is actually higher as the recovery factor comes up with that, and historically, that's what we've seen back when we started in 2004 to '05 to '06 to '07 till today. Year-after-year, we're seeing better performance, and that's exciting, and it doesn't happen in every play. And I won't go through the plays, but there are some plays that either didn't work or the performance actually has come down with time. So it's an extremely exciting play to in and I couldn't be more upbeat about our future.", "Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And just a follow-up question to that was how much more data would you need to move to bar up a little bit?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, I think, it's a combination of what we have in place are a number of those different types of experiments, everything from longer laterals and with -- what a lot of people are going through, I think, more recently are moderate laterals with just a lot more stages in them. So it's a matter of looking how that performs, we think how you drill the land to well matters, so examples out there of tests we put in really over a year ago where we looked at tighter spacing, 500 feet versus 1,000 feet and on I think 3 different pads. So we have some of that information out there. What we'll do since we have so much acreage is continue to drill and probably hold on the spacing that we're on and then ultimately come back later and look at down spacing. If we can drive production up to 1 B per day, 2 Bs per day to 3 Bs per day, during that time -- we'll be driving up production per share, net adjusted reserves per share, net adjusted cash flow per share and at the same time, be able to demonstrate to the market of what the real upside of the properties are, I think we can really create a lot of value.", "Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "One last one. So industry colleagues have talked about a kind of new frac design going down 250 feet between stages rather than 300. Is there any experimentation kind of similar to this or something different that you feel excited about? I know you're calling different things, but...", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, that's one of the things we're looking that I think does have good promise. It's just more stages within the tighter spacing, additional stages, breaking up more rock with what you're doing. I think that's exciting. We've done some of that, and we'll watch those as well as our competitors.", "Operator", "We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Leo Mariani of RBC Capital Markets for our final question.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Could you discuss kind of what your current well costs are in the Mississippian? And also, what's your acreage target as they're obviously adding pretty aggressively?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "The current well costs are close to the 2.9 million drilling complete, and again, we've allocated saltwater disposal costs to that of a couple 100,000 allocating it back. We're close to that. Again, I think in a development mode, if we end up drilling 500 to 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 wells, I'm sure we'll do better than that with time. We haven't really built in and factored that in. As far as acreage, we've been fortunate. It's a big play and it's a big sandblock, so our average acreage cost is really pretty low. One, we've been out there for a long time, and again, we're a first mover, and we're continuing to lease for attractive prices. I don't want to get into the specifics. And when we stop, we'll stop filling our acreage in and one, we'll either build it out or two, when that goes away. And there are other --  a lot of other people getting into the play right now, both majors and large independents, so we'll continue to quietly built it out as long as we can so for very attractive costs and rates of return.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess just in terms of need to hold the acreage, you guys talked obviously about 2 rigs next year. I mean, can you just talk about sort of longer term and what type of activity you may need to hold those leases and give us a little more detail on the terms of the leases?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, we have really good term on our leases. A lot of the leases have tickers on them. We have everything, a variety of things. A lot of the leases are 5 years with 2-year extensions that are brand new and early on. So we got of plenty of time. we've run some quick scoping things. You can probably hold that with something on the order of 10 rigs with time. So you don't have to run a gazillion rigs to hold it. Remember, the fairly shallow wells to 4,500 foot TVD , and that will be a function. Right now, we've drilled 8 wells. Eight wells is exciting, but it's not 100 wells or 200 wells, so we need to see it rolls out and we continue see those kind of results. But if we do, I think we can really build a -- I don't want to get into the specifics, but I've looked at the amount of oil that you can generate in NGLs and liquids. You can generate impressive volumes that are really impactful to us in a relatively period of time without running a lot of rigs.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess just looking at the St. Louis Lime, how many holes you guys think you have in inventory right now over there?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "We have identified a number of other structures, and what we'll do next year is start to test some of those other structures. Again, that's a different play than the Marcellus Shale or the horizontal Mississippian play. You have to find a closed structure and -- but we've identified and leased a number of them. So I'm excited about what that can be, but I think that, again, can be a play that's very impactful to us. But we're probably -- this time next year, we'll be able to quantify that better, but it has nice upside and as you can see, with not a lot capital, running very few rigs. If that continues to drill out, you can really build a rate -- high rate of return project.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Pinkerton for his closing remarks.", "John H. Pinkerton", "Well, thank you, operator, and we want to really appreciate and thank everybody for joining us today. We -- obviously, from our perspective, we felt it was a terrific quarter, kind of hit it out of the park, so to speak, in terms of higher than guidance production, better pricing because of the job of our marketing teams but also because more and more of our production is coming out on the liquid side of the spicket, so to speak, and we're just driving it up. And then, I think, as you can tell from the Q&A, we're really focused on that, and we're making very solid gains, and that should really continue and really accelerate in 2012. The good news is that despite the deterioration of natural gas prices, I think, 2 things are really important: one is that all the gas wells we're drilling really make sense at very, very low prices. So we're absolutely convinced that we're generating attractive returns on the gas wells we're drilling. If we weren't, I would guarantee we would quit. Second thing is the progress we've made on the liquid side and the impact that, that's going to have as we move forward, and so because of that, our expectation, when we sold the Barnett and how we're going to fully fund all this stuff, the timing of that is still right where we thought it was to begin with. And so we feel very strongly that we can continue to fund these projects internally with the balance sheet and the cash flows and the projects we've got, and that we can do it and keep 100% of the upside for all the existing Range shareholders, which is what I really care about, and given the fact that I'm still a very large one, I care about it even more.", "So we're still right on track in terms of being able to fully fund everything internally, and we've got a number of different -- as Roger likes to say, we've got a number of different things, levers we can pull. We've got a great hedge position. We got a great balance sheet position. We've got a great low cost structure, and all that's really, really going to matter as we move into 2012 because I think it's going to be a very interesting time in our industry, and I think there's going to be a lot of stress in terms of the industry to be able to perform under those conditions that we're seeing. We obviously are very, very encouraged with what we're doing, and as Jeff said, we really just care about ourselves more than anything else. But really, we're very encouraged with what we're seeing and the results we've got, and it's really just a -- it's really testimony to the entire Range team and the quality of people we have and the quality of the assets. And really starting to see that, the onion peel back and starting to see the quality. And I think the fourth quarter, we'll see it even more. And then I think -- as Jeff said, I think we're going to be really excited when we display what we're going to do in  2012 and the capital and what's it's going to do in the accelerated production growth coupled with a decrease in costs. It really has a dramatic impact in terms of the company and NAV, and so I'm excited about getting the fourth quarter over so we can show you all that and get that coupled with the year-end reserves, because I think we're all going to be very, very pleased as shareholders, and it's going to set us up very well as we move into 2012.", "So with that, again, thank you, all, for being with us today. And to those who didn't get your questions answered, feel free to call Rodney and David and Laith and the others in our team or Jeff and I will be happy -- and Roger will be happy to answer those questions this afternoon.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney L. Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Today we have a lot of great material to cover so we're going to move directly to our speakers. Hopefully, this will allow for as many questions on the call as possible. Our speakers on the call today in order are: Jeff Ventura, President and our new Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Senior Vice President and our new Chief Operating Officer; Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Pinkerton, our new Executive Chairman. Now let me turn the call over to Jeff for his opening remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you, Rodney. I'll begin with an overview of the company. Ray will follow with an operations update. Roger will be next with a discussion of our financial position and John will follow with his perspective. Then we'll open it up for Q&A.", "Let me begin with a review of where we've been as a company, where we are today and where the company can go in the future. Despite the current low gas price environment, Range is well positioned for 2012 and beyond. This is a result of our multiyear strategy of growth in reserves and production on a per share basis, debt adjusted, with one of the lowest cost structures in our peer group, coupled with building and high grading our inventory. It's also the result of long range planning, both operationally and financially.", "Our organic growth rate from 2003 to 2011 ranged from less than 5% to 2011's top rate of 12%. During this timeframe, Range went from being one of the higher cost companies in our peer group to one of the lowest cost companies. This was the result of getting into plays that if successful, offered very repeatable high rate of return growth opportunities such as the Marcellus Shale and horizontal Mississippian plays. It's also the result of exiting relatively high cost low-growth plays with little repeatability, like the Gulf of Mexico and Deepwood Viner Chalk [ph]. As a result of our strategy, we sold about $1.8 billion of properties during this timeframe. This focused our technical resources on higher quality opportunities and lowered our cost structure. It also provided significant funding for better return projects.", "Looking back, we were fortunate to have sold these properties in a higher commodity price environment. Carrying over a portion of the 2011 sale proceeds into 2012, coupled with our strong hedge position for the year puts us in a strong position to execute on our plan. We're currently hedged on the gas side with the floors of $4.45 per Mmbtu for approximately 75% of our estimated 2012 production. I believe 2012 will be an inflection point for Range.", "In 2012, our organic growth target is expected to be 30% to 35% versus the past 9 years of less than 12%. Since 95% of our capital is planned to be directed into the Marcellus Shale and horizontal Mississippian plays, the growth should also come with higher returns and lower costs than before.", "Given our large acreage position in these plays, we'll have the opportunity to do this for years to come. Even at current strip pricing, all of our projects generate good to excellent rates of return. The rate of return in the liquids-rich portion of the Marcellus and horizontal Mississippian plays range from 73% to 99%. The rate of return in the dry gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale ranges from 27% to 32%. Even in our dry gas fields in Virginia, the rate of return of the wells that we had originally considered ranges from 20% to 27%. However, given that this acreage is either all held by production or we own the minerals, we're limiting the capital allocation for Virginia development to $30 million in favor of higher rate of return projects.", "For 2012, we're projecting 30% to 35% growth based on a $1.6 billion capital program, which is roughly flat spending from 2011. Approximately 75% of this capital will be directed into liquids-rich areas, primarily in the super-rich and wet Marcellus, and horizontal Mississippian oil play. For 2013, assuming that gas prices continue to stay relatively low and oil prices remain high, we can contain capital spending to a level which does not increase our leverage above year-end 2012 levels.", "Given the current strip pricing, we believe the company can grow between 15% to 20% in 2013 using just our internally generated cash flow, if we choose to do so. In this scenario, 85% to 90% of our capital would be directed into our super-rich wet oil plays. We can do this and still retain substantially all the key acreage that we want in the Marcellus and other plays. What puts us in a different category than most companies is that we're positioned to grow at 15% to 20% within cash flow for years to come and retain the ability to significantly ramp up when it's prudent to do so, based on either recovery of natural gas prices or significantly enhanced drilling results. Also, all of our investments are in the best or some of the best plays in the U.S.", "Bottom line, everything we're drilling is well in excess of our investment hurdle rates, which are well above our cost of capital and therefore, will add value to the company. Additional advantages of our 2012 program are: that will increase our cash flow and convert more of our Marcellus and horizontal Mississippian acreage to held by production.", "Given the rates of return, the spending question is not whether this is a prudent economic investment. It's more of a balance sheet question. Our best estimate at this point in time is that our debt-to-EBITDAX at year end 2012 will be approximately 2.7x compared to 3x in the first quarter of 2011 before the Barnett sale. Therefore, we feel that our current 2012 capital plan is very consistent with the prudent management of the resources of the company. Roger will discuss this in more detail shortly.", "In addition, we're evaluating 5 enhancements to our portfolio. They are as follows:", "The first is the super-rich Marcellus. We currently have an acreage position of 125,000 net acres west of most of our drilling in Washington County, Pennsylvania, which we've defined as 1,350 Btu in higher gas or super-rich gas area. We now have drilled 8 wells on the edge of this super-rich area. So far these wells average 400,000 barrels of liquids and 3.9 Bcf of gas per well. One of these wells is estimated to produce 520,000 barrels of liquid and 4.8 Bcf. This compares to our current average wet Marcellus well of 281,000 barrels of liquids and 4.2 Bcf of gas. Given the high price of oil versus the current low price of gas, this super-rich play enhances the value of our Marcellus economics.", "The higher volumes are not only the result of drilling in the higher Btu area, but are also the result of drilling longer laterals and completing them with more frac stages. We've also experimented with reduced cluster spacing, decreasing the frac interval from 300 feet to 150 to 200 feet, all of this looks very promising. Once we extract ethane beginning late next year, this will further enhance the economics.", "The second area is the super-rich Upper Devonian. We believe the Upper Devonian has comparable hydrocarbons in place relative to the Marcellus. This thermal maturity is also similar to the Marcellus. Where the Marcellus is dry, wet and super-rich, we believe so too is the Upper Devonian. To provide more data to evaluate this potential, we plan to drill a few wells in the super-rich Upper Devonian this year, which will be our first test there.", "This potentially can double what we have in the Marcellus in this area. The first super-rich Upper Devonian well has already been drilled and is waiting on completion.", "The third area is the wet Utica. We have 115,000 net acres on our Coopers timeframe of an area in Northwest Pennsylvania that's prospective for wet Utica. The Point Pleasant should also be present across this position, which is the target interval for the Utica test. The drilling depth of the wells in this area will be about 7,000 feet true vertical depth. This well will spud this summer.", "The fourth area is the horizontal Mississippian oil play. We now have about 125,000 net acres in this play, and we started program drilling this year. We have 2 rigs running and expect to exit 2012 with 2 to 3 rigs. This is an oil play with very liquids-rich gas at a depth of about 4,500 feet.", "The fifth area is the Cline Shale oil play. This is an oil play on our Conger field acreage that we formerly referred to as the Penn Shale. Devon, Chesapeake, Laredo and Apache are all in this play and are all calling it the Cline Shale, which is another name for the same interval, so we're changing to the more common industry nomenclature.", "Our first horizontal well here is very encouraging, and we have recently drilled a second test about 10 miles way. We currently have about 100,000 net acres that is prospective for this play. Ray will discuss all of these plays in more detail during his presentation.", "As you know, Pennsylvania recently passed legislation, which adopts an impact fee, better regulatory uniformity and enhanced environmental protection and safety regulations, all of which we believe are positive for the communities where we operate and for continued development of our acreage in Pennsylvania.", "For 2012, we're projecting production growth of 30% to 35%. Production guidance for the first quarter of 2012 is 638 million cubic feet equivalent per day. This represents a 17% production increase over the first quarter of 2011 including the Barnett and a 47% increase excluding the Barnett. We will stay focused on safety and being good stewards of the environment. We are drilling at what most people believe is the best gas play in the United States, the Marcellus Shale. We're also focusing most of our efforts in the super-rich and wet portions of the play, where the returns are as good as any oil or gas play in the business.", "The horizontal Mississippian oil play is also considered to be one of the best plays in our industry. Our high-quality plays and low-cost structure, coupled with our good hedge position and good financial planning have us well-positioned for what looks to be a tough gas price environment.", "Next is Ray.", "Ray N. Walker", "Thanks, Jeff. Let me start out by saying that 2011 was a great year, full of great accomplishments. And I'd really want to give a strong shout out to all the members of our operations and technical teams across the company. In all the divisions we have great news, great metrics and great upside, and it's truly a testament to their dedication and efforts. Our people make this company great. And it's the people that create the value that they as well as we all appreciate as shareholders.", "What I really want to do with my remarks this afternoon is focus on going forward and give you some additional color and details that maybe you hadn't thought about just yet. On our website, in our investor presentation, you will now find maps of our acreage position across the state of Pennsylvania. This is the first time we have disclosed this level of detail.", "Let me focus on Southwestern Pennsylvania for just a few minutes. There's about 210,000 net acres in the wet area, which is that acreage we have been drilling in for several years now, in and around the MarkWest Houston plant. The wet area is defined as that acreage which is between 1,050 Btus and 1,350 Btus. In the dry area, we have about 235,000 net acres, and of course, this area is that acreage where the gas is not processed and is less than 1,050.", "We have 125,000 net acres with greater than 1,350 Btu like Jeff referred to, which we now define as the super-rich Marcellus. We are introducing 5 new enhancements to our portfolio. These are not new projects thrown together in response to current market conditions. In fact, several of them have been in the works for more than a few years.", "We have also been working for some time now to redirect more of our capital and resources to liquids-rich and oil plays. Given the current environment, this strategy is performing well for us.", "Liquids growth for the company in 2012 will be up approximately 40% as compared to 2011 year-over-year. Our first enhancement area is particularly impactful and is what we call the super-rich Marcellus. And I'll spend most of my time discussing this area, and we've not discussed a lot of detail previously because we've been working for a couple of years now consolidating and trading acreage, while at the same time, planning and putting together infrastructure.", "We've now completed 8 horizontal wells in this area. They were drilled in the timeframe beginning in the spring of 2010 through this past summer. And like Jeff said, the average EUR of those wells is 400,000 barrels of liquids, of which 95,000 barrels is condensate plus 3.9 Bcf of gas. I should make it a point to emphasize that these numbers do not include ethane extraction.", "When comparing to other plays like the Utica and the Eagle Ford, it's important to compare apples-to-apples. If we were to extract ethane today like we will in late 2013, these 8 wells would have an EUR of approximately 720,000 barrels of liquids and 3.3 Bcf of gas.", "Simultaneously, we've been developing a completion technique utilizing reduced cluster spacing combined with moderately longer laterals as Jeff mentioned. This new technique appears to have great potential in both our super-rich and wet areas. And in fact, we will be experimenting with this technique throughout the rest of the play this year. So let me tell you about 3 of the wells that we've used this technique on. I've got details for one well in the super-rich area and 2 wells in the wet area to highlight.", "Jeff touched on one of these wells and there's IP information on all 3 wells in the press release. But I really want to take a couple minutes and add some more detail.", "The well on the super-rich area was completed with a lateral length of 4,137 feet in 19 stages. The EUR of this well without ethane extraction is 520,000 barrels of liquids, of which 138,000 barrels is condensate plus 4.8 Bcf of gas. No doubt, that's a great well.", "If you extract ethane, that becomes 915,000 barrels of liquids and 4.1 Bcf of gas. Our plan for the area in 2012 is to drill approximately 59 wells and place 55 of those wells online.", "In the wet area, we completed a well with a lateral length of 2,375 feet in 14 stages. The EUR of this well is 355,000 barrels of liquids, of which 19,000 of barrels is condensate plus 4.8 Bcf of gas. With ethane extraction, it's 748,000 barrels of liquids and 4.1 Bcf of gas.", "Another well in the wet area was completed with a lateral length of 3,425 feet and 22 stages. The EUR of this well is 356,000 barrels of liquids, of which 21,000 barrels was condensate plus 5.1 Bcf of gas. With ethane, those numbers go to 794,000 barrels of liquids and 4.4 Bcf of gas. All 3 are great wells, and we believe illustrate the significance of this technique in both our wet and super-rich areas. Let me talk about economics for a minute.", "Using the average of the 8 super-rich wells, we believe we can drill and complete those wells in a development mode for approximately $4.7 million. At strip pricing, we could achieve a rate of return of 95% and a net present value at 10% of $11 million. This contrasts with our wet area economics, which yield a rate of return of 73% at strip pricing and a net present value at 10% of $8 million based on an average of 188 wells drilled in that wet area from 2009 through 2011.", "As you can see, both areas compare favorably to any play, whether it be gas, liquid rich or oil in North America. While we believe all of our acreage in Southwestern Pennsylvania is prospective and including the dry, let me take a little liberty here and suggest just how impactful this wet and super-rich acreage could be for the company.", "If we took the 335,000 net acres, which is the combined acreage count across the wet and super-rich areas and we assume those acres were developed on [audio gap] over 4,150 wells to drill, that number of horizontal wells with the kind of economics that I just discussed would have a huge impact on the net asset value of our company.", "The second area is the super-rich Upper Devonian Shale. It's really exciting to think that we could essentially have a lay down double sitting right on top of our super-rich Marcellus acreage, especially when you think about the impact to our value that I just discussed.", "Our third enhancement is the wet Utica or Point Pleasant in Northwest Pennsylvania that Jeff described, and we look forward to our first test this summer.", "The fourth project is the horizontal Mississippian oil play. You've already heard a lot about this over the past year and there's a lot of detail in this oil play in our presentation. Again, even though it's very early in the project, with our experienced team and with the data that we have, there is confidence in the production profile of the original wells, confidence in our completion designs and confidence in our projected economics. The team has done a great job with planning, infrastructure and marketing, and we believe our team has positioned us in a significant sweet spot of the play.", "We fully expect the team to continue to make great improvements in enhancing the performance of the reservoir, lowering the cost and improving the efficiencies and economics of our operations there.", "Our fifth enhancement is the horizontal Cline Shale oil play under our Conger properties in West Texas near Sterling City. Last year, we drilled our first test well. That well's been on production for approximately 6 months and looks very promising with great economics. We just completed our second test well, approximately 10 miles from the first and are commencing flow back as we speak.", "We plan to drill 3 or 4 more delineation wells this year and should have results to discuss by the end of the year. At strip pricing and using the first well results and our current today's cost, these wells will generate a 41% rate of return with a $3.7 million PV10, pretty impressive for the very first well. Again, this is a legacy asset with ample infrastructure and with an experienced team on the ground and ready to go.", "It could be a great oil play with substantial upside, and as typical with most oil plays, we fully expect that our team will steadily improve the well performance and cost as we begin drilling in the play.", "I know there have been lots of questions about the new legislation just passed in Pennsylvania. We believe the Commonwealth now has some of the strongest safety and environmental legislation in the country. Range pioneered or advocated for many of the provisions and has been implementing these standards voluntarily in the field for some time.", "From an operations standpoint, having uniformity in how our industry interacts with local municipalities now allows predictable planning and consistent regulation. Also included is a competitive fee to offset our industry impacts with the majority of the revenue directed to those municipalities where drilling is taking place. Again, we congratulate all the leadership in Harrisburg for this great accomplishment.", "In summary, it's an exciting time at Range and a very exciting time for me personally as the new Chief Operating Officer. Range has a great track record of production growth at an industry-leading cost structure. We remain focused on safety and environmental protections. Our balance sheet is strong and we have a great year in front of us that will show even more improvements in unit cost, while experiencing substantial production and reserve growth.", "We now have new enhancements to our already substantial portfolio that should provide growth and exceptional economics in liquids-rich and oil plays well into the future. Overriding all of that, we have what I personally believe to be one of the best technical and operations teams in the business today. And it's truly a great honor for me to get the chance to lead them for many years to come.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny", "Thank you, Ray. Before I take you through the quarterly expense items and first quarter expense guidance figures, let me follow up on some of the balance sheet issues Jeff mentioned earlier.", "Our leverage, prior to the Barnett sale, stood at a debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 3x. Following the Barnett sale, this ratio declined to 2.2x. Range has the financial flexibility to fund our 2012 and 2013 capital spend through cash flow and our remaining proceeds from asset sales, combined with our existing credit capacity and without taking our leverage to uncomfortable levels.", "By uncomfortable levels, I mean that even though our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio covenant limit is 4.25x, if our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio gets much over 3x, we become uncomfortable. And it will not stay there for an extended period. One of the reasons we're so confident with our 2012 and 2013 funding plan is because Range has always had such solid underpinnings to its credit quality. Our low operating cost structure, our disciplined hedge program, our operating control over our major growth areas, our long reserve life, our simple balance sheet, our orderly staggered debt maturity ladder, our sizeable liquidity cushion from our well diversified $2 billion borrowing base credit facility, and perhaps most important, a long track record of low reserve replacement cost and consistent reserve and production growth.", "These strengths are not going to change. We've never compromised our balance sheet to achieve growth for growth's sake. And we're not about to start now.", "Moving to the income statement. There's a new line item this quarter that I need to bring to your attention. E&P companies generally report their transportation, compression and firm capacity expense 1 of 2 ways. These expenses are either netted against revenue or these costs are itemized and included as an operating expense.", "Because our focus is on the upstream segment, and we rely mostly upon our midstream industry partners to provide these services, it always seemed to make more sense for Range to use the netting method. The 2011 Pricewaterhouse industry accounting practices survey revealed that approximately 1/3 of all E&P companies use the netting method and 2/3 use the itemized expense method.", "So to better conform with the majority of other E&P companies, where Range is billed separately for these services, we will adopt the expense method of reporting these costs, and we have re-classed these expenses in our current and historical financial statements.", "Rodney's team has included several new tables on the website to help everyone get comfortable with this reclassification. Please remember that both methods gets you to the same gross margin EBITDAX, cash flow, net income and breakeven mcfe prices. Every $0.01 you see in this expense increase revenue by the same $0.01.", "Cash flow in the fourth quarter recorded its sixth consecutive quarterly increase at $216 million. That's 36% higher than last year. On a fully diluted per share basis, cash flow was $1.35 or $0.09 above the analyst consensus estimate. EBITDAX came in at $249 million in the fourth quarter, which was 31% higher than last year. Cash margin for the third quarter was $3.69 an mcfe, that's up 18% from last year, thanks to higher realized prices and significantly lower op cost.", "Fourth quarter earnings used -- calculated using analyst methodology was $53 million or $0.33 per diluted share. That's $0.02 above analyst consensus estimates.", "Cash flow for all of 2011 was $737 million and EBITDAX for the year was $869 million, it's 28% and 25%, respectively, over last year's annual figures. As always, please reference our website for full reconciliations of these non-GAAP figures, as well as supplemental tables breaking out our results from discontinued operations.", "Moving down the income statement a bit. One of the first things you'll notice is a sharp drop in our direct operating unit cost expense. Including workovers, unit cost operating expense was $0.45 per mcfe. Now this unusually low figure benefited from several prior period adjustments, making the normalized figure $0.49 per mcfe. The important thing to note here is that the normalized $0.49 per mcfe figure is 31% lower than the $0.72 figure from the fourth quarter of last year.", "The first quarter of each year usually sees a slight increase in operating expense due to seasonal operating conditions. So I expect direct operating expense to be in the $0.52 to $0.54 range next quarter.", "As I mentioned a moment ago, we're now breaking out our third-party transportation, gathering and compression expenses on a separate line item rather than netting them against revenue. On a unit cost basis, this transportation, gathering and compression expense was $0.60 in the fourth quarter. That's up $0.44 from last year.", "This expense has trended upward with production during the buildout years, but will eventually flatten out and begin to decline as we add volume through the newly built infrastructure. First quarter 2012 expense is expected to be $0.01 higher than last quarter at approximately $0.61 an mcfe.", "Our DD&A rate continues to decline as our capital efficiency continues to improve. Fourth quarter DD&A fell from $1.85 per mcfe last year to $1.69 per mcfe this year. Going forward into 2012, we expect the DD&A rate to hover between $1.65 and $1.68 per mcfe depending upon our production mix.", "Production and ad valorem taxes declined in the fourth quarter to $0.10 per mcfe. This will likely be the low watermark however, as the new Pennsylvania state drilling impact fee that Ray mentioned goes into effect this year. We anticipate the initial retroactive payment for wells drilled in 2011 and previous years, that's due September 1, to be approximately $25 million. And the 2012 payment, that's due April 1, 2013, will be approximately $28 million. Because of the need to concurrently accrue the retroactive payment and the payment for current year wells, first quarter 2012 production taxes, including the new impact fee will be approximately $0.55 per mcfe.", "In the second quarter of 2012 and the rest of the year, the rate should be closer to $0.20 per mcfe. But as production taxes vary with price and the Pennsylvania law is less than 2 weeks old, we're still working through all the details.", "G&A expense adjusted for noncash stock comp and other nonrecurring items for the fourth quarter was $0.59 an mcfe. That's $0.06 below last year. And we expect unit cost G&A to be a few cents lower next quarter, likely coming in between $0.55 and $0.57.", "Fourth quarter interest expense was essentially flat with the third quarter, but came down from the prior year on a unit cost basis to $0.60 due to higher production. We continue to build production volume at a faster rate than debt. So interest as a unit cost should continue to decline slightly in 2012.", "Exploration expense, excluding noncash compensation in the fourth quarter, was $24 million. And that's up from $16 million last year due to the timing of budgeted seismic expense. The first quarter of 2012 should see exploration expense in the $26 million to $27 million range before drifting down to the low-$20 million range later in the year.", "Unproved property abandonment and impairment for the fourth quarter was $28 million. This figure is up from last year's $24 million due to year-end reassessments of our acreage and our drilling plans. Unproved property impairment in the first quarter should decline and will likely be between $19 million and $21 million.", "Touching back briefly on the balance sheet before I conclude. I would add that we are not anticipating any reduction to our $2 billion borrowing base at next month's bank redetermination. Though most banks have significantly reduced their price deck that they apply to borrowing base loans from last year's levels, our strong reserve quality and reserve replacement history, combined with our favorable multiyear hedge position and cost structure should result in an easy 2012 reaffirmation of our $2 billion borrowing base.", "In summary, 2011 was a terrific year for Range, consistent reserve replacement and production volume growth combined with lower unit cost have produced increasing revenue and cash flow. A true inflection point. When combined with our strong balance sheet and hedge position, 2012 is set to be another great year.", "John, over to you.", "John H. Pinkerton", "Thanks, Roger. Terrific update. As everybody has mentioned today, obviously, our 2011 results, I'm very pleased with. I want to congratulate the entire Range team for their extraordinary performance in 2011.", "Over the past 8 years, we've repositioned Range driven by our strategy of consistently growing production reserves at low cost. The 4 key takeaways are:", "One, Range has achieved 6 consecutive years of double digit per share production in reserve growth. Only a handful of companies have ever achieved this high level of consistent growth. Importantly, we have the ability to extend this streak for many years.", "Second, we have one of the lowest cost structures now in the industry. We have seen unit operating cost decline from a high of $1.05 in 2008 to $0.49 in the fourth quarter of 2011. We've also seen our D&A expense drop from a high of $2.48 in 2009 to $1.69 in the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect to generate further enhancements to our cost structure in the years ahead.", "Three, we have painstakingly pieced together very high return low-cost inventory of drilling projects that now totals over 8,600 locations. These projects generate attractive returns even in the current low natural gas price environment.", "Fourth, we have assembled a very talented group of people who work together extremely well and are extraordinarily focused on delivering our strategy of low cost -- I mean, of consistent growth at low cost. Inflection point has been mentioned several times on the call. I think inflection point very clearly defines where Range is positioned today.", "We have worked tirelessly over the past years to sell $1.8 billion of mature higher cost properties, lower our cost structure and strengthen our balance sheet. In particular, the bold move last year of selling our Barnett Shale properties, which at the time comprised 20% of our production reserves, was a defining moment for Range. As a result, we now have a balance sheet that can fully support our operating strategy.", "I want to highlight all of this was accomplished with a laser focus on shareholder value. The bull's eye of our inflection point is our drilling inventory. We have a diversified portfolio that covers over 1 million net acres and includes the best liquids projects in the U.S. in Southwest Pennsylvania, high-quality oil projects in the horizontal Mississippian play in Oklahoma, the Cline Shale play in West Texas and some very high quality dry gas projects in Northeast Pennsylvania.", "In last night's operations release and the updated company presentation. We have added a lot of information including detailed acreage maps and well economics to stress the high return, low cost nature of our portfolio.", "While the returns and costs are terrific, I'm convinced our team will do 2 things. First, they will make the results better over time by optimizing the returns. And second, I believe they will continue to deliver for Range's shareholders just like they have done in the past 6 years.", "In summary, while the last 6 year's results have generated significant value for Range's shareholders, I believe the best is yet to come. The inflection point has clearly raised the bar. Now it's up to all of us at Range to make it happen in 2012 beyond.", "Operator, let's now open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just a question on the liquids play. Could you tell us, I know it's very early, but could you talk about potential spacing here, as well as kind of drilling plans, how active you intend to become on that play.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, Neal, that's a good question. We currently today are drilling our wells generally on 1,000-foot between laterals, which would translate into longer -- moderately longer lateral cases to something around 80 acres. Do we expect, I mean the question is, do we expect it to get denser? I think in most plays today, we are seeing denser development as time goes on, but it's just too early to give you a number at this point because we just simply got to do more wells. We got to get reserves, do some modeling, measure the hydrocarbons in place and so forth. So today, we're generally looking at 1,000 acres and also trying to HBP all the acreage through there as we drill.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And I would just add on to what Ray said. Particularly if you look at the oil plays, specifically like the Mississippian, we put out recovery factors of 4% to 9% of the oil in place. Do I expect ultimately it'll be that? No, I would say it probably will be higher. Most likely will come from down spacing. Same with the Cline Shale, whenever you get oil plays with more viscous fluid, to go to tighter spacing I think is clearly reasonable.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, then just one follow-up. Just on the horizontal Miss. We've heard some chatter about just, over at [indiscernible] County and I guess state results showing a bit more volatility, some not as good. But if you can maybe just a comment on just overall results and shale expectations for the play.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I think in any of these places it's really important on where you are. There's always a core area and non-core areas. There's better areas and poor areas. I would say looking at the results of our Mississippian wells even though it's early, there's only 8 wells, but the average results of 485,000 barrels per well is really great. It's outstanding. So I feel comfortable that we're in a good position. And we think really what drives that is the fact that where our acreage is located. Really that's an oil play with a lot of water. We think being high structurally is good. A lot of our acreage is up on the Nemaha Ridge, so we're higher uplift, so we're higher structurally. The other advantage of being up on the ridge is that you have a chat component to your production. And with chat comes higher porosity. The chat -- when you get off structure, you tend to lose chat or you don't have nearly as much. The porosity in the chat is 30% to 40%. The porosity in the carbonate is 3% to 5%. So you have significantly higher porosity and a better structural position is what we think leads to those results.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dave Kistler of Simmons & Company.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Real quickly on your CapEx for '13 and growth for '13. You talked about those numbers with respect to living within cash flow. What are you actually targeting? I mean, that seems more like a kind of a test case or an illustrative example, but should we be thinking about more like 30%-type production growth numbers? And living outside of cash flow kind of tying up our models to maybe 3x that debt to EBITDAX figure.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Let me take a crack at answering that. It's a great question. Really what we want to give total granularity on what we're doing in 2012, what we're seeing for 2013, it shows you the flexibility of the company and the optionality of what we can do. If we choose to live within cash flow, we can still grow at 15% to 20% per year, if we choose to do that. And importantly, I think when you look at a company our size and given our portfolio, I'm not saying we are going to do this, but if you could grow consistently at 15% to 20% for years for a company that has a market cap for more than $10 billion with the cost structure and return we have, it's pretty impressive. That being said, we really want, what we're saying is, we want to maintain the flexibility that based on where gas and oil prices are, based on the results of our wells, even if we choose to cut back for a year to live within cash flow, if we do that, we have the ability to significantly ramp up the following year, say, and really capture a lot of the NPV. So we got the ability to ramp up or down depending on what we think is the most prudent to do. I know you guys probably want the answer to that today, but what we're going probably to do is what we've done in past years. Where we'll continue to look throughout the year and we'll continue to look at where gas and oil prices are, where our portfolio is, what the results of the wells are, present it to our board in the fall, come out with our plan, most likely early next year like we do every year. But we'll give you -- we'll continue to give you guidance or a little bit of color as we go throughout the year. Most importantly, we're telling you what we can do. We can, if we want to, choose to cut back and live within cash flow even if it's for a year, still retain all the resource potential, still retain our acreage and then ramp up when we want to. So we're not saying we're doing that for 2012. But we're saying we have the ability to do that if we choose to do so.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Okay, I appreciate that. And then just a clarification on your liquids production growth number for '12. If I heard it correctly, you said 40% liquids production growth. Can you split that up for us between oil and gas?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, the percent growth, we've given guidance on the overall production 30% to 35%. And I guess the way to answer that is say, the liquids year-over-year 2012 compared to 2011 will be growth of 40%. So we're disproportionally growing more in liquids than we are in gas. It's definitely back-end loaded towards the end of this year. There's no question about that because we have been trying to consciously make this shift from dry gas over to the liquids-type plays for several months now. And we're still evolving that. We're still waiting on the infrastructure in certain cases and things like that. So the best clarity I can give you today is to tell you that year-over-year, it's going to be about 40% liquids. I think in the coming calls, into the next quarter or so we'll have a lot more granularity that we'll know by that point. Right now, we're just trying to maintain flexibility to be able to get to that point.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "I guess the clarification I was looking for was really with that 40% liquids growth, the split between oil and NGLs, I apologize.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, what we've tried to do over the next few weeks is continue -- we're in the process of fine-tuning our models and everything else. Hopefully within the next few weeks, we can come out with something in guidance that we can put out for everyone in terms of what that will be.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Okay, I appreciate that. One last one, if I might. Just looking at the Cline Shale, obviously returns there are little lower than what you're seen in the super-rich and what you're seeing in the Miss Lime. At anytime point would you think about liquidating that asset and redirecting capital in these high-return areas?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, I think the key thing. Your comments are true, except what to me is so exciting is that's our very first well. If you go back and look at our very first Marcellus wells, they really weren't that good. And typically in all of these shale plays, you tend to see significant improvement with time in terms of what you can do in terms of driving down costs or driving up initial rates and reserves. The fact that our very first well IP-ed at 600 boes per day and has a rate of return off of today's costs, and assuming no improvement in reserves and just what we can drill it for today, still generates an attractive rate of return is really exciting. So I have great faith in the technical teams that are working that, led by Ray and Mark and the rest of the guys that at the end of the year, that's going to look a lot different and hopefully, I think a lot better. And then we always assess with where it looks a specific point in time. But to me, to come out of the box on the first well, usually it's a strike or foul tip or you're beaten out of bunk to first base, that's a solid single for a first well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ron Mills of Johnson Rice.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "On the Mississippi Lime, can you talk about -- maybe some of it has to do with where you are in the Nemaha Ridge and the structural component. But the variance between your well design and some other people in the play, you have a much shorter lateral with fewer frac stages. Is that something geologic in your area? Or is that something that you will begin to test longer laterals and increase frac stages like you have started to do up in the Marcellus?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, Ron. And that's a great question and Jeff sort of alluded or hinted at an answer a little bit in that there are geologic reasons that we think it's better. We are primarily up on the uplift. We've done a real good job of concentrating our efforts in putting our operations and acreage together there in a consolidated manner because a lot of it is focused on operational efficiencies. We're a little bit shallower up on the ridge. We got a little bit less gas or pumps downhill can work a little bit more efficiently. We can drill shorter laterals because we think the rock is probably or potentially a little more fractured. We've got the chat, which has higher porosity. And so what we've seen with the first 8 wells and granted it's the first 8 wells, so it's very early in the play is that with 2,200 feet in 12 stages, which is approximately 1/2 of what people are doing out to the far edges of the basins, we're seeing the top end of the reserves. And I think all of those things kind of accumulate to get the results that we're getting. Of course, what we're doing this year, we're going to be -- we got 2 rigs running currently. We're going to drill, put online about 23 wells in that area this year. We'll drill about 3 saltwater disposal wells. And I fully expect that the team's going to do a great job in getting those costs down and learning things about where to target the laterals and become more efficiently -- more efficient in the way that they complete them. And then of course, we are going to look at some longer laterals and that sort of thing, just like we would in any play. So hopefully, without rambling on too much that answers your question.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "And do you have, was this a seismic-driven portion of the play where you were looking for structure? And if you look at your total 125,000-acre position, do you start to get a little bit more into a strat portion of the play versus structure? Or have you been able to confine your acreage more along this uplift?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. Let me try to answer your question. And I think it's important to get into the history of the play for us. We really started in that play back in 2004 as a reactivation of Tonkawa field, which was the world's or the U.S.'s largest light oilfield back in the early '20s, late 19-teens. And we started reacting within a shallow formation there was the Tonkawa at a depth of about 2,700 feet. So we did that, which is reactivating that old field. Once we did that after the first couple of years, plus or minus, the team recommended shooting a 3D over that old field which was to me was pretty creative at the time because there's such well density, you think, how can anybody missed anything. And what it led to, was it led us to drilling deeper targets like the Mississippian and even things below, in the Wilcox and Redfork and some of the other targets. As we did that, drilling them vertically we found that, \"Hey, the Mississippian was even better than the Tonkawa.\" And then what it led us to do based on our interpretation was to move off that structure. Remembering, the whole structure really is up on the Nemaha Ridge and the ridge is 10 to 20 miles wide and several miles long, runs up into Kansas. So it's got us to drill off structures. So we found out, not only were the Mississippian wells good on structure in this localized area, they were good off structure. So then we started to drill horizontal wells 1.5 years, 2 years ago and really started ramping up our acreage position. So when you look at it from a broad sense, our acreage is all along, and it's up on for the most part to Nemaha Ridge. So within that whole area -- and there's a cross section in our presentation that shows it that when you got off the ridge, you fall off on either side of it. But our acreage predominately is located all up on the ridge. So we're from a regional sense, high structurally with all of our acreage. Seismic really doesn't drive it. We shot seismic, that helped us get there. But at this point, we're all, we're in a great position structurally. We're high up in the play where you got oil and water, which is a good thing. And there's a lot more chat when you're up there on the structure. So sort of a long answer, but hopefully, that answered your question.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "And then as it relates to the Upper Devonian and Utica Shale, you obviously talked more about Northwest Pennsylvania today than before. But when you look at the Upper Devonian, the Rhinestreet versus the Genessee versus the Tully, is there any one of those Upper Devonians that is a more prolific target in your opinion? It looks like the Rhinestreet's a lot thicker than say the Genessee's? Or do you think you're getting contributions from multiple, those Upper Devonian zones? Or how do you think about the development of that opportunity?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, let me lead off with the answer and then I'll turn it over to Ray for a little more color. To me, what's exciting is, in a broad sense, you have the equivalent amount of hydrocarbon in place in that Upper Devonian section that you do in the Marcellus. That's pretty exciting. And then when you look at it from a thermal maturity again, it's roughly equal. So you have just -- and we put the maps out on the website again so you can see dry, wet and super-rich in the Upper Devonian. And we've only really tried drilling and completed 2 wells so far. Again, what's exciting to me about those 2 wells and they both were in the wetter, on the dry side of the wet line or in the wet area, is you have a thick interval just like you described. And off of our first 2 tries again, we actually made pretty reasonable wells. And again, when you look at any of these shale plays, usually the first 2 tries are your strike outs or other science experiments, we actually made pretty decent wells the first 2 tries. To put it in context, just like you said on that slide and Rodney, are these the right numbers?", "Rodney L. Waller", "Yes.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "So it's on Slide 27, you can see that the Marcellus is much thinner than that total Upper Devonian section. So in the Marcellus, plus or minus, what we're drilling is 80 to 120 feet. So we've found that if you still early on, where you land the well in the Marcellus, just moving it up or down within that 100 or 120 feet, you can double or quadruple the rate. So where you land it and how you complete it is extremely important. So now we have a broader interval in the Upper Devonian. So if you ask me, I'm going to turn it over to Ray in a minute. Did we optimally land those first 2 wells. I sincerely doubt we did because it's just so early on. But even not optimally landing them, we made reasonable wells. And now we're going to go into the super-rich area, and we'll see what the hydrocarbon content is. And again, I think we're really going to go up the learning curve in terms of how do we optimally land them and complete them and what they'll cost. So Ray, do you want to try to put a little more color on there or...", "Ray N. Walker", "I don't know what else I could say.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "By the way, Ray, you put in -- most, some of you know this, probably not all of you, when Ray started with this, he actually was out on the wells completing them and frac-ing them. Then he also was the first guy to open our office and built the office. And now, he's our Chief Operating Officer. So when he speaks, he's speaking with great authority because he's been there and done that.", "Ray N. Walker", "The first 2 wells, we did primarily because we knew there was a lot of hydrocarbon in place. And in fact, like I finally used the term, it's almost like a lay down, double right on top of the Marcellus. And we knew it was there. The question is, can you complete it, can we make it economical, commercial, all those things? And so the first question was, was everything connected? Or when we completed the Marcellus well, were we in fact connecting to the Upper Devonian since it was so close. With those first 2 wells, we designed them in such a manner to try to answer that question. We did isentropic  analysis, which is simply fingerprinting the gas, to determine if it's 2 separate reservoirs. We did some downhole pressure work and different things. And so, we have proven that it's 2 separate reservoirs. And even where you're on the same pad completing in the Marcellus, you still have a unique isolated reservoir above it in the Upper Devonian. Now we've only done 2 wells. The industry has only done a handful of wells. And so I think we're far from knowing where the optimal place to land the lateral is. But I feel like, with the test that we have and with the information that other industry folks have shared with us, that there is a lot of potential there. And we'll probably be experimenting with 2 or 3 different places over the next year to try and to figure out what that optimum answer is. So that's about all I could add to it at this point. I think Jeff did a great job of describing where it started from. So...", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "But do you think you'll end up with potentially 4 different development zones? Or so in other words, is there an effective frac barrier between some of those Upper Devonians? Or you may end up getting contribution from multiple Upper Devonian zones in one frac?", "Ray N. Walker", "I think today, we'll get it all from one lateral. I mean, potentially down the road, might there be 2 laterals pretty close together. Like for instance, there is in the thicker parts of the Barnett. I mean you could see that way out in the future. But I think at this point, we believe it will all frac together. And we'd be able to complete it that way.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "You're saying -- and to clarify that, we're saying we think the Marcellus is one completion and then the double is the Upper Devonian. So one well can frac all those intervals, the Upper Devonian intervals together as a separate second unit.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with RBC.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of quick questions here for you. Looking at your acreage in Pennsylvania, it looks like some numbers have kind of moved around a little bit this quarter. I'm seeing your acreage in Northeast Pennsylvania go from 240,000 net to 180,000 net. And your acreage in Southwest PA went from 550,000 to 570,000 net. Just curious is there kind of -- what's going on there maybe there is some acreage swaps? Or maybe you guys have let some acreage in Northeast expire? Any color you have around that would be helpful.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. We can all chime in a little bit. I think what you're saying is exactly true. Our focus really is right now is the wet and super-rich of the Southwest. It's our big core position and given where oil prices are and gas prices are, clearly, our best economics. So the land dollars that we're spending are down in that area. So 100% of it is down in that area. Also when we're trading, we're trading to block up in that area. So we're trading stuff that's outside of the area to get stuff inside. And not all those trades, they aren't proportional because we really like the area and we think it has stacked pay and superior economics, we may trade 1.3, 1.4 acres for 1 acre to get it in the wet because we think the value is so much greater. So it's a variety of things like that.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess looking at your super liquids rich area of 125,000 acres, how much of that do you think is de-risked at this point, if you guys could talk a little bit about infrastructure in terms of gathering and processing on that acreage.", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, we feel like it's all de-risked. There's enough well data, penetrations all around it that we feel pretty confident it's there. Now there's different levels of de-risking. We still got to get in there and drill and determine what the exact composition of the liquids will be and all that sort of thing. We have contracted additional process capacity with MarkWest. There were some announcements that went out on that. Here a while back, a month or so ago. And we've got plans with MarkWest to lay infrastructure, put compressor stations in that area. So that was part of what I said in my notes that we've really been working on this for a couple of years, both doing acreage trades, consolidating, filling in the holes and putting plans together for infrastructure. These big pipelines and the transportation on some of the lines that go through there and the rail facilities and the de-ethanizers and all of the things that are coming together didn't happen overnight. So we've actually been working on that for quite a while. So...", "John H. Pinkerton", "And including the ethane agreements, the 2 got signed and the others that we're working on. It's all part of the master plan to optimize that because it obviously has the highest returns and the highest net present value.", "Ray N. Walker", "Right, and so to coin the phrase we've been using a lot, it's really an inflection point for that area because we've now got 8 wells that are online. We've got all these infrastructure plans in place and it's now time to start drilling. So like I said, we'll put approximately 55 wells online this year in that area. So I think you'll see us talk about that area a lot this year because that's really going to be a big focus for teams in Pennsylvania.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And in terms of your program for this year, you guys talked about outstanding cash flow. Any other plans for any other non-core asset sales this year that might prevent the debt from ramping up as much?", "Ray N. Walker", "We've got several small properties, cats and dogs and a couple of positions in some non-operated cases that we'd like to divest of at some point. But at this point, we're not going to give them away in this kind of environment. So I think that's going to always be part of our plans going forward is to continue to take the high cost, low return type properties off the bottom of the pile and monetize it and take that money and then reinvest in the higher return projects. We're just down to the smaller properties at this point.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I would just add. Like I mentioned, I think the bulk of the heavy lifting's done, and we sold $1.8 billion worth of those properties. There's small things here and there, if we can sell them, great. And if we can't, we're still in good shape.", "John H. Pinkerton", "Yes, and this is John, even taking it a step further, I think, we've now got the balance sheet that we could -- we've got several levers we can pull and we can pick and choose. Obviously, like we've always said, if somebody comes in and wants to make us an offer for something, and we think it's attractive, we'll take advantage of that and then recycle that money. But the good news is, given all the great work the team's done and under Roger's leadership, now we have the balance sheet and liquidity and availability to really pull either one of those levers and do the one that's most attractive for the shareholders. So I think that's, again that's an inflection point, too, that I think is really driven again by what I said was the bold move of the big Barnett last year. It really puts us in a position to be on the offensive versus being on the defense in the low gas price environment.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, and I would just add. Last year was critical but more like I'll go back, it's really the last 8 or 9 years of just having a consistent strategy of growth at low cost on a per share basis, building high-grade inventory. Because we've consistently done and executed on that for years, it's put us in a great position for 2012 and beyond.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay and I guess a question on your production guidance. You talked about 638 million a day in the first quarter. Because if I look at that number compared to the fourth quarter of '11, it's up about 13 million a day. In 4Q '11, you guys added about 90 million a day sequentially. Obviously, that's kind of lumpy growth. Could you guys maybe just talk a little bit more about how you expect it may play out into the next quarter, are there any significant sort of milestones in terms of infrastructure components that are looking to come on, where you might see production jump dramatically in the second quarter or maybe the third quarter? Any color you guys have around that will be helpful.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I'd give you a little color, but before you downgrade our growth a little bit. Let me say, it's still 17% production increase over the first quarter of last year. And then if you account for the Barnett sale, it's 40% -- 47% year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter growth, which to me is pretty impressive. Granted, when you look at the 30% to 35% for this year, it'll be back-end loaded sort of like what it was for 2011. I couldn't be more excited and not only are we getting the growth, but we're growing our liquids disproportionately relative to the gas like Ray pointed out earlier. But we're going to stick with quarter-by-quarter guidance like we have every other year.", "Ray N. Walker", "And I can add just a little color in that. It's pretty traditional especially in the Northeast for the first quarter of every year to not grow a whole lot over the fourth quarter. I mean, you've got wintertime, you got everybody's in a real crunch at year end and there's a lot of maintenance and things that happen in January, February, March timeframe. So that's pretty traditional and so that kind of helps explain it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Scialla of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "You've given a lot of guidance on your plans for infrastructure and agreements that you've entered into for ethane. I'm just wondering given some recent weakness in propane prices, what are your thoughts on the other NGLs and maybe condensate as well in terms of where you see price going and would you be willing to hedge more here?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, I would and several of us will probably chime in on this one. I would say we have continued to hedge the condensate price that we received now is basically close to oil price for that area. So that's encouraging. We are hedging. We'll continue to look out to hedge to lock in the strong returns that we have. So again, you got to look at the whole program of, we have a very rich gas. And in order to build and grow volumes, you got to handle the ethane. But that's a good thing because the ethane is an enhancement to the economics and will add value over time, creates more space in the pipelines to move more gas and more liquids. So I think we're in a great position.", "John H. Pinkerton", "And just add on what Jeff said. I think the key here is you want to grow volumes and reserves, but you also really want to focus on growing your cash flow. And where going to get the biggest bang for your buck given where oil and gas prices are is obviously the condensate and NGLs. So we're aggressively hedging those out because there's such high prices. And we got great markets in the Northeast for those. And MarkWest is doing a good job in terms of storage and selling and all the contacts that they've got. So we are aggressively hedging our condensate and our NGLs up in the Northeast. And you'll see that on the hedging program slide and you'll also see it in the quarters -- the months and quarters to come. You'll see us continue to hedge that. And we talked about it a lot at the board, so we're going to take that price risk off the table. We like those prices a lot and we'll accept those because we make such great rates of return.", "Ray N. Walker", "On your condensate up in the Marcellus, it's about 84% of WTI posted prices. So that's selling at $84 to $85 a barrel up there, which typically has -- it's probably $5 or $10 more a barrel than what it traditionally has been. So you're C5s and your C4s and your C3s, which are your heaviers really have had a very stable and increasing price over the last 6 months. Where you've had a little weakness is propane. Propane is primarily a heating fuel. We didn't have much of winter. So therefore, you've got a weakness there. You've had a weakness in the ethanes, which basically is because you got 2 crackers down off the Gulf of Mexico. So it's going to have some seasonality and they always do a lot of maintenance at the first part of the year. But with our C5 proxy hedges that we're working off of, we're actually locking in on the heavy side of the barrel, the liquids and we think that will give us some uplift to the weaker side of the barrel until we know exactly what our ethane productions are, et cetera. And then in 2013 and '14, be able to move and be able to bifurcate that barrel to hedge both the heavies and the lights appropriately. So we're just working there, but that's something we look at every day. And we hedged some C5s yesterday, probably at $6 above our average of what we have got built into the system. So it's a thin market. You just do it when you can.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I appreciate that. Looking at your presentation, you show well cost in Southwest Pennsylvania for your wet area of $4 million for your 5.9 Bcf type well. Is that a projected development mode kind of cost or representative of what you're seeing recently?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, when you look at those -- it's interesting when you look at the cost we have in the development mode and by area particularly, I'm glad you asked. When you look at the wet area, when you look at existing pad drilling down there, they're straight away wells or right at about $4.4 million, some of them as low as $3.8 million. The wider swing outs maybe $4.3 million, $4.4 million. So that number, we basically achieved the development mode cost for that particular area. I would also say for the horizontal Mississippian play, when we're seeing in a development mode, we're basically at those costs. And theoretically, in a development mode, if we've got 1,000 or 2,000 wells to drill which could be if it all drills out, I expect that team will do 1 of 2 things like they have in the Marcellus, either significantly drive down costs or we'll have longer laterals with higher rates of return or longer laterals with more stages and higher rates of return. Also when we say development mode cost, on the Cline Shale same thing, it's what we're drilling them for today. So hopefully that answers that question.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes and I'll just add a little more color in that. We are really excited about this reduced cluster spacing in the longer laterals. So we will be drilling longer laterals. And we'll be putting more fracs per foot of lateral. And that's all going to increase cost. And so you may see cost on a well-by-well basis that are higher than some of the numbers in here, but that's because there's a lot more money spent on completion. And consequently, we'll get a better return with more reserves that, that well produces. So it's a little bit of apples and oranges, but that -- what we try to do is take the average of the last 188 wells that have been drilled in that area and that's the kind of numbers that we come up with.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, let me just pile on to Ray a little bit. What we've talked about is the wet area having very strong economics. But the super-rich area, because of the higher liquids component coupled with the longer laterals or more stages, are moderately longer laterals with more stages, it's even an enhancement of that.", "Ray N. Walker", "Right.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Ray also mentioned a couple of the wells in the wet area where we've tried longer laterals and more frac stages and reduced cluster spacing and those wells look really attractive. We didn't tell you the rates of return, but if we drill more of those types of wells in there, we believe we can really even potentially enhance the rates of return in the wet area beyond where we are now with that new technology. And throughout the year, towards the end of the year, that should be another significant improvement to what we're doing.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And this is probably a dumb question. But I'm just wondering, with gas prices as low as they are and really almost all the value in the wet gas, part of the Marcellus being driven by the liquids and you mentioned earlier that the very low recovery factor, have you looked at all at the feasibility of reinjecting the methane, could that help maintain reservoir pressure and maybe improve the liquids recovery?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Let me come back and clarify what you're saying. When I was talking about lower recovery factors of 4% to 9% of the hydrocarbon in place, I was referring to the horizontal Mississippian oil play. So one, I want to clarify that. The second one is when you look at a shale and reinvesting gas in, it's just too low permeability. Again, gas prices are where they are today, our economics are strong. Personally, I believe at some point in time, and I can't tell you whether it's -- or even if you look at the strip, when you go out a few years, I don't think gas is going to be $2.50. Gas maybe $4 to $6, or $4 to $5, or $4.50 to $5.50 but I expect that gas at some point in time will move up a little bit.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I thought that was a dumb question. I'm glad you clarified that. Let me end with one last one. Looking up at Venango County in the Northwest part of the state, you mentioned you have drilled some wells up there. Any color around what you're seeing up there?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "We -- I want to clarify that. We're saying we will drill in the Utica up there in the summer and spud a well there. But given the well control that we have from looking at old wells and even current wells around us, we feel that our acreage is very prospective for wet Utica and for having the Point Pleasant.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan McSpirit of BMO Capital Markets.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "You illustrate what percentage of your Marcellus shale acreage is held by production today. What are the same ratios look like say, over the next 1 to 2 years from the Southwest to the Northwest and I guess to the Northeast of Pennsylvania?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, let me see if I can handle it, to start with the easy one. Northwest is 100% HBP today.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well the -- we have the -- let me clarify that.", "Ray N. Walker", "Almost. Yes.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "If you look at the traditional Cooper's timeframe of an area, which is where the bulk of our acreage is, it's all HBP. We've added a little acreage in and around the fringe so that number is 83% HBP today.", "Ray N. Walker", "Oh, okay, okay.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "So but I think right now it's showing 47% to 51% in the Southwest and Northeast. You're probably going to add roughly 10% per year to that. But let me talk about a really important point there, so if we look at the 3 areas, the Northwest is pretty easy. I mean, you can drill a hole that, we'll see what the Utica looks like. That isn't an issue. In the Northeast, this is really an important point. We talked about we have the ability, if we choose to do so, to take the roughly 4 rigs we're running in Alabama to -- a rig or 2 at the end of the year and a minimal program next year. The way we can do that is those leases up there tend to be bigger leases and there's continuous drilling clauses with them. And I always use the example of the best one. So I'm telling you, it's the best one. But we have one lease up there that's 25,000 acres. And literally, it just requires one well per year to hold the lease in perpetuity. And as long as you drill one well per year. So to HBP it would take a lot of drilling and take a long time. But we can hold the acreage for the next 50 years by just drilling one well per year. And a lot of those leases are 1,000, 2,000, 5000-acre blocks. That's what gives us the ability to cut back to 1 to 2 rigs next year in the dry area. If you look at where we really need to drill to HBP, it's primarily in the wet and super-rich area in the Southwest, which fortunately is where our highest rates of return are. That's where we have a lot smaller leases, and we really need to drill to hold more. So that's -- and then the other part of that is if you look at the Southwest and on the map, it shows super-rich dry or super-rich wet and dry, most of that dry acreage in the Southwest is HBP by old -- by shallow legacy production, just like most of the stuff in the Northwest is. So really, it's a little better than it sounds. That's why we have a lot of flexibility to ramp up or down in certain areas or direct our dollars to where we think we're going to get the highest rates of return.", "Ray N. Walker", "And just to pile on to that, if you look at our capital budget this year, the great preponderance of our leasehold dollars will go towards the Southwest Pennsylvania and locking up and continue to...", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "In Southwest PA, wet and super-rich.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, and to build that position and continue to fill in and whatnot. The good news is we own, we're the 800-pound gorilla in that area. So we're in great shape there. But the bulk of those dollars just to give complete transparency is going to go there. And there'll be a little bit of money out on the Cline Shale and the horizontal Mississippian, but the bulk of the dollars are going to go into Southwest PA as Jeff mentioned.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, got it. And second question here. You continue to demonstrate higher yields on lower cost in the Marcellus. Can you speak to at least in general terms your -- where you go from here? That is, what could drive the next step change in targeted economics? Is it including the ethane stream?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Let me start and I mean, Ray and other people, we're going to give you joint team answers today to show the integration of our team or the excitement I have that I had to jump in, in front of Ray. I think that it's really interesting when you look at the rates of return in the wet area and the upgrade by going to the super-rich. We're taking a well that's rate of return at strip pricing in the 70s up to the mid to high 90s by moving into the wetter areas and into the super-rich, just the quality of the type of reservoir fluid coupled with moderate length laterals with more stages. I think the next big jump will be taking that same technology and just doing it in the wet area. And the evidence of that is we've tried it on 2 wells. What we didn't show you but we have are the rates of return of the wet area. So we want to get a bigger sample set and we want to make more history. But it could be we can then significantly improve what's in the wet by drilling and completing them differently than we have. I think that's the next big change and it may not be that far out there. And Ray, you can -- and the other thing with Ray, other than being a great guy and a good -- a great manager, he's really strong technically. I think one of the best completions guys out there. So now with that big build up, what's next?", "Ray N. Walker", "Wow, I'm excited to hear what I'm going to say. Well, I think what I envision as the next big steps is, one is this reduced cluster spacing. Because coupled with everything that Jeff was talking about in the liquids rich play and our better understanding of all of that. This reduced cluster spacing, which is not really that new. It's kind of a term that we use, but it's essentially putting more fractures along the wellbore in a better optimized position, let's call it, that's reflective of that particular situation. We're seeing some real step changes in performance. And that's pretty exciting. I've often been asked what's the most exciting thing or most surprising thing about the Marcellus today and it's been just simply the rock. It's mother nature who was really good and she put some really good rock. And for lots of different reasons that I won't go into, Range finds itself with I think some of the best rock that there is anywhere. And so past that, it's really going to be our technical team becoming better and better, able to understand what the rock's telling us. We're continually improving our reservoir description capabilities. In other words, to try to describe exactly what the porosity and the permeability means, exactly what the thermal maturity means, exactly what the Btus, exactly what kind of conductivity we need in the wellbore. And then past that, I think we're seeing a real step change in the quality of the service industry in Pennsylvania. I mean, we went from -- when I first went up there in 2006, being so bad that I'd really won't talk about it here, to a point today that all of the latest, greatest technologies and things that are happening are happening in Pennsylvania around the Marcellus. And so we are very much a company that likes to apply technology off the shelf. And it's really the, finding the people that understand the right way to apply that technology. And then trying to optimize performance not only on a well-by-well basis but on a project basis over several years. In other words, we could drill really long laterals and make great big reserves and IPs, but our project for the year might get less return than it would drilling moderately long laterals and getting wells online faster. So it's going to be a real evolution and I kind of handicap us as being in inning 3 or 4 of a 9-inning baseball game. We've made great deals. We're way out in front, but we got a long ways to go. So...", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And let me add a little bit. I talked about something that we literally could experience this year not that far out and that's just taking that technology and applying it in the wet area. Ray talked about some things that can go on beyond that. And then I'm going to paint the picture for 5 to 10 years down the road. I mean, they can even get more exotic, assuming the Upper Devonian really drills out, can you have stacked laterals off the same pads or all kinds of things like that. Beneath there, we don't talk about, but you actually have dry Utica. We're excited about the wet Utica in Northwest PA, but there's a bunch of dry Utica right underneath that same acreage. You'd literally have 3 stacked pays there. Might you have triple stacked laterals in year 10? Who knows. But I think -- but what I can say is historically for the whole history of the industry, technology has improved consistently with time. And I don't expect that it will stop.", "Operator", "We will go to Jon Wolff of ISI Group for the last question.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I'm just thinking about the commercial acreage. I think you said 315,000 in the wet gas area. There's a significant amount of acreage to the east of that, which you -- a couple in your southwest acreage out of Westmoreland and Fayette. I was curious if there are wells there and what your feeling was. And then when we think about the commercial acreage that's outside of the sort of 700,000 that you talked about, when we look at like Venango and some of the northern areas, wouldn't they pose perhaps lesser economic risk than some of the dry gas in the Southwest?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, let me say, and if you look at the dry gas in the Southwest, again, a lot of that acreage is HBP by legacy shallow wells that we control and operate. So I think that the potential of that acreage given drilling in and around there, there's no doubt it's prospective for the Marcellus and there's some good wells in Fayette County, in Westmoreland, Armstrong County, I think EQT has a 16 million a day well. And we've got wells on the edge of it that are that good or better. So I think that acreage in time will be very attractive. When you go up to Northwest PA, I think it's very prospective for Utica. We've got some control on the edge of our acreage on either side of it that shows -- we know where the oil, wet gas contact is. And I think we believe we have a pretty good feel for the wet gas dry contact. Our acreage is sort of right in the fairway. We believe we got Point Pleasant on it. So I think that acreage position is very prospective. It's at a reasonable depth, not unlike what we're drilling in the Marcellus. Long term, a lot of it, well, almost all that acreage is HBP, 83%. So it's a big chunk of it. It is held by old historic Medina wells at about 5,500 feet. Up-hole there, you have Marcellus potential and we actually tried one well in the Marcellus. We haven't reported it. But it was an interesting and I'd say somewhat encouraging first try. It will be something down the road or something we can look at how we take value out of it. But there is, I think there's no question there's value on that acreage. It's wet gas, so that's very interesting. And then I think when you go up to, our acreage position in the Northeast, again, it's new technology. We announced really we've got 4 wells. We talked about 2 of them in the release. But if you look on the website, it shows there's a couple of other wells on the big blocks we have up there that are encouraging. There's other horizons behind pipe. It's really lightly explored. So I think there's a lot of upside on all that acreage. But because a lot of it's either HBP or we have these really good favorable drilling clauses, we can direct and focus most of our near-term capital in the areas that have really high rates of return and we're retaining that upside for another point in time.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And on the Utica plan, you'll drill a well soon, spud a well soon.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "That's probably around the middle of summer of this year.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So do we have any feeling of what point you'd say some of it's de-risked or not de-risked on the 330,000 acres up north?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, I mean the first well is good. I'll be very encouraged because we got pretty good control. So if the first well is good, I'd expect that future wells probably would be. But again to be conservative, we'll do what we've done in some of the other plays, we'll probably just scatter a handful of wells probably over the next 12-month period past that, across that acreage position to show what our acreage is. But we're also looking at, there's a lot of industry activity that either has or will be occurring in and around our acreage. So I think that's a very exciting upside.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I've never been a big fan of selling acreage in your core areas, but given the capital need as potential for super wet, a lot of super wet gas, is any of the dry gas acreage potentially JV-able or saleable perhaps in the Southwest dry?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I think we'll always look at optimum ways to run our company, optimum levels of growth and optimum ways. We look at NAV. Really, what we're looking about is how do we maximize the value our company. And a lot of that depends on the quality of the acreage. It depends on what you think future of oil and gas prices are going to be and what the market is for those pieces. So we'll continue to stay focused on maximizing the value our company. And we'll be open-minded about that. That being said, everybody around the table here, people on the call, it's a huge part of their net worth. So we're aligned with the shareholders and each -- every individual in our company is a shareholder. It's an important part of our culture. So we're aligned with you.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And I might have missed it, but was there any talk about a potential third NGL or ethane solution such as at Mariner East and how likely do you think that is?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "We're continuing to look, yes, we really think we have an opportunity to really drive up volumes in the wet and super-rich areas. So these first 2 ethane solutions are just that. The first 2, we're looking at other solutions. Mariner East is one of them. There's some real advantages to that in terms of where you can potentially bring the product. And we'll be looking at growth and expansion. And I think you'll hear more and more about that with time.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his closing comments.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I'd like to close with what I believe are the 4 main takeaways for Range. First, we have a very large acreage positions and some of the best plays in the country, led by the Marcellus. Given the acreage we have, we should be able to achieve double-digit growth in production and reserves on a per share basis for many years. Second, given the high quality of our acreage and the plays that we're in, we should continue to be one of the lowest cost producers in our peer group. Third, given the good financial position that we have, which Roger just described, we can clearly fund our 2012 program with cash flow and existing liquidity without levering up the company and keeping our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio at or below 2.7x.", "For 2013, we believe we can grow 15% to 20% within cash flow, if we choose to do so. Finally, the 5 enhancements to our portfolio, the super-rich Marcellus, the super-rich Upper Devonian, the wet Utica, the horizontal Mississippian oil play and the Cline Shale oil play, all offer significant upside to the Range story. These 4 keys will drive shareholder value for years to come. Thank you for participating on the call.", "Operator", "Thank you for participation in today's conference.

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are statements forward-looking. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions]", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney L. Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the first quarter with a continued increase in production and a decrease in unit cost. Both earnings and cash flow per share results were greater than First Call consensus.", "Our speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Range has filed our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It's now available on the homepage of our website or you can access it using the EDGAR system. In addition, we posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today. We've also added tables which will guide you in modeling our future realized prices for natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. Detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter is also included on the website.", "Now let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you, Rodney. I'll begin with an overview of the company. Ray will follow with an operations update and Roger will be next with a discussion of our financial position, then we'll open it up for Q&A. ", "Range is on track to achieve the targets that we've set for 2012. We're on track to grow production 30% to 35% year-over-year, exit the Marcellus at our goal of 600 million cubic feet per day net and to grow liquids production 40% year-over-year. We're also making good progress in all 5 of our enhancement areas, which are the super-rich Marcellus, super-rich Upper Devonian, wet Utica, horizontal Mississippian oil play and Cline Shale oil play. Ray will give more details on all 5 projects in his talk.", "Financially, we're also in good shape and making good progress as well. During the quarter, Range continued to lower its cost structure. On the units of production basis, our company's 5 largest cost categories fell by 6% in aggregate compared to the prior-year period. Our natural gas hedge position is excellent for 2012. We're 75% hedged to the floor price of $4.45 per Mmbtu. We recently completed our bank redetermination and reaffirmed our borrowing base under the bank credit facility at $2 billion and increased our commitment amount to $1.75 billion. We have no debt maturities until 2016 under our bank facility and 2017 for our notes.", "I want to highlight the great job that Roger and his team did on the recent $600 million bond offering, which resulted in the lowest interest rate ever by BB-rated company in any industry. We issued the notes at a fixed rate of 5% for 10.5 years. ", "Most importantly, in today's environment of low natural gas price and high oil price, all of Range's key projects generate attractive rates of return. 75% of our 2012 capital is going into liquids-rich projects, almost all of which is wet or super-rich Marcellus or the horizontal Mississippian oil play. The rates of return on these projects range from about 70% to 100% at strip pricing. Almost all of the remaining drilling capital is going into the Northeast Marcellus, where the rate of return is in the mid-20% to low 30%. We'll be decreasing our rig count in the Northeast to roughly 1 rig by the end of this year and refocus more of our capital into the higher-return areas.", "Historically, it was important to be in the core part of a particular play. Given the disparity in oil and natural gas prices, it's now not only important to be in the core part, but you've got to be in the wet core. Also, not all the plays are created equal. Some plays don't have wet cores or wet areas at all. Other plays do, but are higher cost and lower return. Fortunately, Range has a huge acreage position in the wet part of the core at one of the best rate of return plays in the U.S., which is the southwest part of the Marcellus.", "We also have a large position in what we believe is the core of the horizontal Mississippian oil play in Oklahoma and Southern Kansas. This is one of the highest rate of return plays in the U.S. Plus, we have tremendous upside in the super-rich and wet Upper Devonian, wet Utica and the Cline Shale oil play.", "Including only our 5 enhancement areas, we have about 800,000 net acres in the liquids-rich portfolio -- in our liquids-rich portfolio that are prospective for wet gas, super-rich gas or oil.", "Differentiation between companies at this point in our industry is key. The key question is, which companies can make good returns in today's price environment? At Range, we expect to drive up production and reserves per share on a debt-adjusted basis for years to come, with strong returns and low cost even in today's commodity price environment. We'll do so while staying focused on safety and being good stewards of the environment.", "At the IPAA Conference in New York last week, there was a lot of interest in Range from fund managers and analysts. Some of the feedback that I heard from the meetings was that in this environment, investors are seeking E&P stocks that offer both significant downside protection and significant upside per share, and Range is one of them. That's great feedback to hear in any environment, and we're proud to have earned that trust.", "I'll turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.", "Ray N. Walker", "Thanks, Jeff. My comments today will cover several topics. I'll talk about cost, efficiencies, well performance, production guidance and give some operations updates from our divisions.", "Like Jeff said, we're off to an excellent start to meet our production growth targets in 2012. Our plan to shift more of our resources and capital investment to liquids-rich and oil projects is on schedule, and we can see this already beginning to pay off.", "As we stated in our earnings release, the first quarter production came in at 655-point (sic) [655.5] million cubic feet equivalent per day, which was comprised of 512.5 million gas, 17,152 barrels of NGLs and 6,682 barrels of oil and condensates.", "I think it's also important to characterize the types of production specifically. While we do produce a lot of gas, I don't think most folks realize that 71% of our total production is coming from our liquids-rich and oil plays. All of that rich gas has significant Btu and liquids upgrades and, therefore, has significantly more value than the dry gas.", "We had only 29% of our total production coming from dry gas areas in the first quarter. For example, looking at Slide 19 of our investor presentation on the website, which focuses on Southwest PA and not considering hedging, we would simplistically say that we're getting 3.2x the realized price for our wet gas versus our dry gas in Southwest PA. Again, the largest portion of our gas production is rich gas, with significant Btu and liquids upgrades from our liquids-rich and oil areas.", "While this year approximately 25% of our capital budget is directed to the dry gas areas of our portfolio, if the current commodity price environment persists, you will see us cut our spending in the dry gas areas significantly at the end of this year once we've completed the majority of our HBP drilling in Northeast Pennsylvania.", "Production guidance for the second quarter is 715 million cubic feet equivalent per day net comprised of 6,000 barrels of oil, 18,500 barrels of NGLs and 568 million cubic feet per day of gas.", "In order to answer a few questions in advance that you would logically have, the liquids gross that we have projected for the year is heavily weighted towards the third and fourth quarter as it simply takes time for the new drilling in the liquids-rich and oil areas to kick in. You should expect to see the different components growing at different rates throughout this year.", "In fact, you may notice that the oil rate for the second quarter is actually less than the first quarter. It's basically a result of timing for new wells and infrastructure coming online throughout the year. These fluctuations are simply necessary for all the advanced planning for our drilling program and infrastructure development that is underway.", "In the Marcellus, we brought online some great wells in the first quarter. For example, sales from the 10-well pad in the wet area which had a working interest of 97% and an NRI of 82.4%, began in the middle of March. Initial production from that pad was approximately 30 million a day equivalent from 2 wells. However, the wells were constrained due to equipment limitations. Six days later after installing additional equipment, the rate off the pad was increased to 45 million a day from just 3 of those 10 wells. This flow period lasted about 28 days.", "After changing equipment at the compressor station, production from the same pad was ramped up to approximately 75 million per day. This rate has been steady for 4 days. And at present, a total of 7 wells out of the 10 wells are producing, with the other 3 wells still setting in as we are still capacity-constrained to 75 million.", "The average lateral length for these wells is 2,763 feet with an average of 10 frac stages each. And none of the wells have reduced cluster spacing completions. Again, reduced cluster spacing is simply a technique utilizing clusters of perforations that are placed closer together on the lateral. I'll refer to the reduced cluster spacing technique as RCS throughout the rest of my remarks.", "This 10-well pad in the wet area of the Marcellus was a great example of our engineering and operating teams recognizing the potential production volumes and, in very short order, eliminating constraints in order to produce the additional volumes. These particular wells are also much better than the offsets, due to some reservoir and rock properties analysis that our team has come up with to determine the best target for the horizontal lateral in the Marcellus.", "At no additional cost and by simply landing the lateral in a different part of the Marcellus, we achieved greatly enhanced production performance. As we combine this technique, along with RCS techniques, moderately longer laterals and increased conductivity frac designs, we expect to see continued improvement in capital efficiency and well performance going forward.", "Shifting to Northeast Pennsylvania. In Lycoming County, we recently brought online 4 new horizontal wells that produce the sales at 24 IPs, up 26 million, 23 million, 21 million and 18 million a day, respectively. Those wells had an average lateral length of 3,000 foot and 10 stages and were 100% working interest in approximately 85% NRI wells.", "As you can see, our technical teams are continuing to make great progress in enhancing our well performance in this area. We plan to bring online 45 more wells in this area in 2012. And again, like Jeff said, we'll decrease activity to the 1 to 1.5 rig level at year end as we HBP the majority of that acreage with this year's drilling program.", "Now let me spend just a few minutes on cost and efficiency improvements. Our operating and technical teams in all the divisions continue to do a great job in driving down unit cost. Our LOE for the first quarter was $0.48 per mcfe, and we continue to see progress in that area. Roger will be giving guidance for the second quarter LOE in just a few minutes. ", "As important as making improvements in cost and well performance, we are also making great improvements in operational efficiency. Significant gains in efficiencies will serve us well as we continue to learn to do more with less, especially in this gas price environment.", "Year-over-year 2011 versus 2010, we saw drilling efficiency improvement in our Southern Marcellus operations of up to 50%. We drilled 34% more horizontal wells in 2011 with 11% fewer rigs. That's a huge improvement in anyone's book. On the completion side, we saw equally impressive metrics when comparing 2011 to 2010.", "In 2011, we saw a 53% increase in frac efficiency compared to 2010. The improvement was a result of our key performance indicator process which focuses on equipment and location personnel. It simply utilizes GAAP identification to identify opportunities to work faster and smarter. This 53% improvement in frac efficiency translates to a 12% composite average of savings in our overall completion cost. ", "We're also seeing very good improvement in service pricing. As an example, recently renegotiated frac contracts are expected to translate to a 4% to 5% improvement in total well cost and will literally save us millions of dollars going forward. We are really proud of those operating teams. These efficiency and cost improvements are truly great accomplishments that will play a significant role in maintaining and improving our low-cost structure while enabling improved capital efficiency going forward.", "Now some updates from our liquid-rich and oil areas. We just brought online our first 3, 2012 super-rich Marcellus wells. And while it's way too early to talk about rates, the wells appear to be meeting our expectations. For some very recent and very noteworthy news, flowback operations on one of the wet area wells located on the 3-well pad just at the edge or the border between the super-rich and the wet area began just last week. We announced in our press release that the peak 24-hour production from that well, which has 100% working interest and 84% NRI, was 7.1 million cubic feet of gas, 108 barrels of condensate and 501 barrels of NGLs, not including ethane. If we were extracting ethane, that would translate to 6 million of gas and over 1,300 barrels per day of liquids. The well's lateral length is 2,752 feet, and it was completed with 14 stages using the RCS method and the new targeting of the lateral. The production from the well is approximately 1,340 Btu gas, which again puts it right in the edge of the super-rich area. ", "In fact, the well has gotten even better as we've opened it up. I just got a report this morning and for the last 24 hours, the well made 168 barrels of condensate, 578 barrels of NGLs and 8.1 million of gas. That's almost 750 barrels of liquids not counting ethane. If we counted ethane, it would be 1,547 barrels of liquids with 7 million cubic feet of gas. This well certainly bodes well for the super-rich area potential. And based on this well's initial results, we believe the new targeting methods and the RCS-style completions could significantly improve performance in both the wet and super-rich areas.", "We now have 7 rigs running in super-rich Marcellus and expect to have approximately 15 new wells in that area online in the second quarter. As we progress throughout the year, we plan to keep you updated quarter-by-quarter with results from this area.", "According to our current development schedule, which is always changing and adapting, there will be approximately 50 more wells brought online this year in the super-rich Marcellus during the third and fourth quarter. This means that as of today, our plans are now to bring online approximately 65 wells in the super-rich Marcellus in 2012.", "In addition to the 28 wells brought online during the first quarter in the wet Marcellus area, there are approximately 50 more wells planned to come online in the wet area during the next 3 quarters. And of course, there will be a handful of delineation and commitment wells drilled in other areas of Southwest PA throughout the year.", "We're just getting started in the super-rich Upper Devonian Shale and have now frac-ed our first well and are literally commencing flowback operations as we speak. We're also currently drilling the second well. We have rotary sidewall cores in 2 super-rich Upper Devonian wells. And although we've not completed these wells yet, I'll give you some preliminary observations.", "We see TOCs of up to 11%, cross fees up to 8% and permeability measuring all the way up to 700 nanodarcies. For those without ready reference to the technical data for comparison or, in simpler terms in English, this is very encouraging.", "In addition, we saw the best mud loss shows [ph] that we've seen today across any Upper Devonian Shale. Now here's some really technical terms. One set of the cores was oozing condensate and the other cores from the other well were dripping condensate. Needless to say, everything we see today supports our hypothesis that the super-rich Upper Devonian could be a very nice liquids-rich play.", "Shifting to the horizontal Mississippian oil play in Oklahoma, we now have 2 rigs running and have brought online our first 2 new wells. The average IP of those wells is 525 BOE per day, which is 320 barrels of oil, 117 barrels of NGLs and 530 mcf of gas. And although still very early, they are well above our performance expectations. These wells had an average lateral length of 2,700 feet and 15 stages with 100% working interest and 81.5% NRIs. We've also increased our acreage position to about 145,000 net acres. ", "As it's still early in this play, and as we continue to closely watch our results, it's part of our overall goal to continue to shift our focus towards a very high rate of return projects across the company, and this is surely one of those. The infrastructure, both midstream and saltwater disposal, were coming together nicely. And we are on schedule to significantly ramp up production from this area as we move into next year.", "Our technical team also continues to gather data and monitor activity in the wet Utica area of Northwest PA. Namely, we appear to be right on strike with several great wells that have been released recently by other companies. Offset leasing activity and drilling plans announced to offset operators that are all confirmation of a potential liquids-rich play. Proprietary log and core data that we've recently obtained continues to support that this area is highly perspective for liquids-rich and condensate production.", "We feel our 190,000 net acres, which is primarily HBP-ed, is positioned well and we're still on track to drill our first wet Utica well this summer. We now plan to also drill a second well later in the year that you can now see located on our updated investor presentation map of the Utica wet area.", "The Cline oil horizontal play at Conger is really picking up steam. We'll be moving a rig in this quarter to begin drilling 3 wells across that acreage. Devon has permitted 3 wells, directly offsetting our lease line to the East, is now illustrated in our investor presentation. One of those wells is just 2.5 miles from our lease line and the other operators in the area have 4 rigs running.", "The IP of the second Cline well was 484 BOE per day, with 282 barrels of oil, 123 barrels of NGLs and 476 mcf of gas. And it was completed with 11 and 16 successful frac stages, with a lateral length of approximately 4,500 feet. The first well was also about 4,500 feet of lateral and had 7 of 10 stages successfully completed.", "As you can tell, we're still learning and optimizing. Even though neither of these completions was 100% successfully completed, the results still fit right in line with our expectations. And as we test the acreage with different targets, lateral lengths, different completion designs, we believe our technical team can significantly improve results going forward. All of this information will be helpful in derisking our 100,000 net acre position which, again, is 90% HBP. ", "Another point to make here, as well as in any area of horizontal development, is to compare apples-to-apples when talking about production performance from differing lateral lengths and number of stages per lateral. As always, what we do here at Range is continue to optimize lateral lengths and number of stages to obtain the best rate of return from the project. What we really compare when looking at different well designs is the resulting return on investment.", "Our technical team has continued to do an outstanding job with their legacy stock-pay assets. In addition to the Cline Shale, the Permian team recently completed its second vertical Wolfberry well on our Conger field properties at an initial production rate to sales of 517 BOE per day, which was 212 barrels of oil, 144 barrels of NGLs and 969 mcf of gas. The first Wolfberry well had an initial production rate to sales of 495 BOE per day, which was 195 barrels of oil, 141 barrels of NGLs and 954 mcf of gas. These wells are 100% working interest and 75% NRI, with approximately 1,200 feet of stacked pay and were completed with 11 and 12 stages. The average 90-day production to sales for the first well was 204 BOE per day, which again, was 59 barrels of oil, 83 barrels of NGLs and 372 mcf of gas.", "Range has the potential for an additional 100 to 150 vertical Wolfberry locations on 40-acre spacing at Conger. I should point out that some operators in the area are discussing the potential of, and some are already drilling, on 20-acre spacing. And we could certainly see that same potential here. As confirmation of the potential here, I'll also point out, that there are 33 rigs in the area drilling Wolfberry wells. ", "We plan to drill 2 additional vertical Wolfberry wells this summer, while we have the rig out there drilling the Cline wells. We'll drill one vertical Wolfberry then the 3 horizontal Cline wells and then finish with the second vertical Wolfberry well.", "Infrastructure, transportation and marketing are all on-track for all products in all areas. We currently believe we have plenty of firm transportation, plenty of sales and along with plans to keep our gathering, compression and processing capacity well out in front of our liquids-rich developments into the future. As much as our drilling results are a testament to our technical teams, I'm also really proud of their progress in the areas of safety and environmental protection.", "We continue to make improvements in handling our fluids across all of our operations. For 2011, our spill rate when handling produced water, flowback water or oil and condensate was 0.0025%, or more simply said, 25/10000 of 1%. While still not 0, which is our constant goal, this is indeed an accomplishment to be proud of. In fact, we've already seen a 17% improvement in that statistic during the first quarter versus a year ago. Our teams are absolutely committed to and will never be satisfied until we get the 0 spills going forward. ", "At the same time, we achieved a 50% reduction in recordable incidents during the first quarter, along with a 60% reduction in days-away restricted and transferred instance, or what we used to call loss-time incidents. ", "Our total recordable incident rate was a 0.76, which is well below our 2011 peer group average of 0.99. As always, we strive for no incidents, and we surely never want anyone to be hurt or injured. But we are very proud of the way our teams have continued their focus on safety and environmental protection, and are today maintaining a culture throughout the organization that truly supports one of our primary core values at Range.", "All in all, we had a great first quarter and we're well-positioned for the future. Our employees continue to do a great job, and our shift over the past couple of years to liquids and oil plays is really beginning to pay off. Our already low-cost structure is steadily improving and we are continuing to recognize improving efficiencies along with improving well performance. We are right on track to meet our goals, and we plan to continue to deliver what we say we will. ", "Now over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny", "Thank you, Ray. Like last quarter, I'll start with the balance sheet and then work over to the income statement. ", "Range strengthened its balance sheet in the first quarter through 3 actions, designed to bolster liquidity and reduce risk.", "First, in February we issued $600 million of 5%, 10.5-year, no co-fi [ph] senior subordinated notes. Proceeds were used to repay bank debt and prefund a portion of our 2012 drilling program, with $123 million in cash on hand left at the end of the first quarter. These long-term fixed-rate notes helped insulate Range from the interest rate volatility and better match the average life of our assets to the liabilities that fund them.", "Second, in March, we requested, and in April, received, a reaffirmation of our $2 billion bank credit facility borrowing base. And we increased the credit facility amount commitment from $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion. Lastly, we added 3 new North American banks to the credit facility. The addition of the 3 new banks, combined with the refinancing of floating rate short-term bank debt with long-term fixed rate notes, lessens our balance sheet risk, while the increase in the commitment amount increases our liquidity.", "Turning to income statement. Cash flow for the first quarter was $163 million, roughly equal to the first quarter of last year. Cash flow per share was $1.02, $0.05 per share over analyst consensus estimates. EBITDAX for the first quarter was $198 million, also roughly equal to last year's figure. Cash margin for the quarter was $2.68 per mcfe, 19% lower than last year due to declining prices, outpacing declining cash expenses. The earnings calculated using analyst methodology were $24 million or $0.15 per share, that's $0.02 above analyst consensus estimates. Our website contains full reconciliations for these non-GAAP figures to GAAP, in addition to several supplemental tables breaking out results from Barnett discontinued operations.", "Moving to the expense categories and second quarter guidance figures, we're pleased to report another quarter of reduced unit cost expenses. Direct operating cost, including workovers, was $0.48 per mcfe, 36% lower than last year's first quarter figure of $0.75 due to reductions in water handling cost, low service cost and equipment rentals. Operating cost also benefited from unseasonably mild winter weather. We expect unit cost operating expense to be in the $0.51 to $0.53 range for the second quarter of this year as we have scheduled some extended equipment rentals to bring on several new multi-well pads. Third-party transportation, gathering and compression expense is now broken out on a separate line item as opposed to netting the expense against revenue.", "On a unit cost basis, transportation gathering and compression expense was $0.68 in the first quarter, up from $0.56 last year. It came in slightly over guidance on this item in the first quarter due to some prior-period adjustments. Second quarter expenses should be approximately $0.63 per mcfe. ", "The DD&A rate for the first quarter was $1.68 an mcfe, that's $0.03 higher than 2011's first quarter due to the Barnett assets being held for sale last year. The DD&A rate may fluctuate a few cents up or down with production mix during the next quarter.  And a more significant downward change should occur later this year as we reevaluate our proven reserves.", "The first quarter marks the debut of the Pennsylvania impact fee, which we are combining with the production tax and as one tax line on the income statement.", "The character of the impact fee is somewhat different than traditional production taxes in that the primary driver of the fee is the number and timing of wells drilled. There's not yet a clear consensus among companies and accounting firms regarding the best way to account for the Pennsylvania impact fee. Therefore, you may observe differences in how the fee is recorded by other companies, and you may see differences in how Range presents the fee in future periods to conform to industry norms.", "But in the meantime, we'll be providing quarterly guidance for the Pennsylvania impact fee on an absolute dollar basis. And production tax guidance for the non-Pennsylvania production on a unit cost basis spread across total company production.", "The $24 million retroactive impact fee component for wells drilled prior to 2012 that we mentioned on the last earnings call is passing through the first quarter of 2012 as a special item. There's also a $6.2 million current year impact fee provision representing the first quarter accrual for wells drilled so far in 2012 and the carryover from wells drilled in prior periods. ", "First quarter production and ad valorem taxes for the company's non-Pennsylvania properties totals $0.11 per mcfe. Now in the second quarter, based on currently projected drilling, we anticipate the Pennsylvania impact fee will be approximately $6 million. Total company production and severance taxes for the second quarter are expected to be $0.12 per mcfe plus the $6 million impact fee.", "G&A expense adjusted for noncash stock compensation and other recurring items for the first quarter was $0.50 an mcfe, $0.05 below last year. Unit cost G&A in the first quarter benefited from a nonrecurring expense offset of $0.03 an mcfe. So we expect second quarter G&A expense to be in the $0.52 to $0.54 per mcfe range.", "Interest expense for the first quarter was $0.62 an mcfe, down considerably from the $0.73 figure last year when our leverage peaked just before the Barnett sale. And due to the new fixed-rate notes bearing higher interest cost in the current closing rate bank debt, we anticipate second quarter interest expense to come in right around $0.66 an mcfe.", "First quarter exploration expense, excluding noncash compensation, was $21 million, $5 million below last year due to the timing of our seismic expenditures. The second quarter should see exploration expense between $23 million and $25 million, due to increased seismic spending that was originally slated to occur in the first quarter. Please remember that Range does not capitalize any of its exploratory or developmental seismic expense. ", "Unproved property and abandonment and impairment for the first quarter came in at $20 million. That's up $3 million from last year. Second quarter unproved property impairment is expected to be between $20 million and $22 million. ", "As Jeff mentioned at the opening, approximately 75% of our 2012 natural gas production is hedged at a floor price of $4.45 an Mmbtu. Also we swap additional 2013 natural gas volumes during the quarter, bringing our 2013 natural gas hedged volume to 343 million per day at a floor price of $4.41 an Mmbtu. We increased our 2012 NGL hedges to 12,000 barrels per day at a price of $96.28 per barrel. A summary of all of our hedge positions appears in the press release tables, and full hedging detail may be found on our website.  ", "The first quarter saw continued improvement in our cost structure and balance sheet, with available liquidity at a record high. While everything is on track for the year, because of the timing of leasehold expenditures, the first half of 2012 we'll see a front loading of capital spending, while the back half of 2012, we'll see stronger production growth.", "In summary, despite significantly lower natural gas prices in this year's first quarter, we kept cash flow even with last year while hitting all our marks on the operating side.", "Jeff, back over to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.", "Mr. Singer, are you there?", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Our next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond from Simmons & Company.", "Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "You spent $75 million on land this quarter. Is that onetime in nature? Or could that bias total CapEx higher throughout the year? And then how is that allocated? Was that all in the misc line?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "No, on capital, we're confident we'll stick to the $1.6 billion for the year. So we'll be at that number, along with the 30% to 35% production growth and 40% increase in liquids. So we're on track there. That land is all targeted, either towards the wet or super-rich part of the Marcellus. Of course, that stacks with the wet and super-rich part of the upper Devonian or the Mississippian. So that's where we're spending all of our money.", "Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "And then with the announcement of your prolific vertical Wolfberry wells, would you consider reallocating additional capital to that play this year? And then how did the economics in that play compete with some of your other areas?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, I mean, it's been good news. The team did a really good job of coming up with an opportunity. And I'm going to step back for a minute, I think a lot of what you see, it's typical across our areas. We get in the areas that have stacked pays, rich hydrocarbon charge and really good technical teams working in those areas. And what that allows is for opportunities year after year after year, because those guys figure out new things and new ways to increase recovery factor. So that's very typical of the Range portfolio. It's a great opportunity, the wells are performing strongly. In fact, if you compare them against other operators and other analogous production out there you'll see -- granted it's just the first 2 wells, but they compare very favorably. The rates of return looks strong. We were actually debating whether to do more on this call and decided to wait maybe another quarter, maybe do them on the second quarter, but they're strong rates of return. We'll drill a couple more wells this year. Like Ray said, it's an exciting opportunity, 100 to 150 locations at 40-acre spacing. I feel comfortable in time, it's probably more likely will be double that because it's more likely 20s or lower spacing, given the fixed section and high amount of hydrocarbon in place. But I think we'll stay on track. That's an exciting opportunity, but the Cline is equally exciting in that the Cline covers the entire 100,000-acre position. At 50-acre spacing, that's potentially 2,000 wells. And you can see knowledgeable Permian players all around us are now targeting and drilling it. So the more we understand and unlock the Cline, both are great opportunities, the Cline just has a lot more  running room.", "Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "And then one final question, which is you addressed in your prepared remarks the decline in oil volumes from Q1 to Q2 based on your guidance. Can you put a little more color around some of these infrastructure constraints that are leading to that?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, and that's a good question. Basically, it's just an artifact of wells coming online and timing with the infrastructure that's being planned. I mean, like we talked about in the last quarter, a lot of these projects we've been working on for a couple of years and part of that is putting together midstream deals and things like that. And so to make a long story short, it really is just an artifact of the point that even though we're bringing out some of the new horizontal Mississippian oil wells, they're just not coming online. And we're just not going to see a lot of that increase in production until we get into the third and fourth quarter. And a lot of that is going to be driven by the increased amount of activity that we've got in the wet and super-rich Marcellus area. And that stuff is just simply artifact of the wells coming online. So what you're seeing is the wells are going online in the first quarter just naturally declining off, and we're just not adding that many wells in the second quarter.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "The important point though is we're still on track for 40% year-over-year growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Couple of questions. First, on the -- with regards to your reduced cluster spacing, can you just talk about how widely you expect to use that across your Marcellus acreage? And then what that does in terms of well cost relative to your standard completion?", "Ray N. Walker", "Great question, Brian. The reduced cluster spacing is a technique -- it's really 1 of 4 different things that we're working on right now. There's reduced cluster spacing. There's going to moderately longer laterals. There's increased conductivity frac designs, which is simply putting more higher conductivity fractures that potentially could be smaller jobs pumped and then better targeting of the lateral in the rock. And so it's -- we very seldom, as much as we would want to, just try one of those things at a time. You really -- never really get that opportunity to do that. So it's really hard to say that a certain amount of cost increase is associated with RCS versus smaller frac jobs because we'll be combining all of those going forward. And the answer is yes, it does cost more to put the perforations closer together because we're doing more of it. And it does cost more to do more frac jobs along the lateral. And in some cases, if we're steering the well a little more, it may cost more to steer the well while we're drilling. But what we're really focused on, like I said in my prepared remarks, is when we get to the production results looking at the return on investment of all those various combinations. And with the -- we got 7 rigs running in the super-rich today, we'll be adding a lot of data to analyze over the next coming months and quarters. So I think, really, we'll have a good feel for how all of those things affect our results going forward. But the important thing is everything we've done today says that we're getting better results. But I'm reluctant at this point because it's so early to tell you that a certain amount is attributed to RCS versus lower laterals or whatever else we're doing.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I'd just like to add on to what Ray said. I think the important part is if you look at the economics we put for the Southwest PA and wet Marcellus under strip pricing or what's out there on the website, that generates a 73% rate of return. And we're -- the actual economics, and that doesn't incorporate all the things that Ray are saying. So there's a chance as good as 70% -- 73% is that can get better. Same thing when we announced the 8 wells in the super-rich originally, and that's the economics set on our website that you can look at. They're actually even better. They went up to a 95% rate of return at the strip pricing that's on the slide there. But there's a chance you can enhance that because we did not apply all those things to either of those. So as good as it is, the opportunity exists that the economics could be really enhanced in both areas.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And do you expect that -- given that these wells are producing at twice the initial rates, do you expect a normal course decline curve that would then lead to twice the EUR? Or do you expect a steeper decline curve?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, we can certainly hope for twice the EUR. But I think at this point, it's just too early to know. IPs are not necessarily as good a judge of the character of the wells' performance long term. It's what they used to be in the old days because -- one simple reason certainly in the Marcellus is, there's very few wells that ever come online that aren't constrained somewhat due to compression or gathering or whatever. So the answer is we're really encouraged with what we see. And like Jeff said, the important thing is every decision we do here is driven towards trying to get a higher return on the investment that we make. And all of these things we're trying we believe will drive those returns that we've got in our investor presentation up even higher. And that's what we're really shooting for.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And another key thing there. When you look at those economics like I just referred to, in the super-rich, we have the 8 wells originally that we announced on the last call where I gave you a little more color this time. But those original 8 wells have been online for an average about 1.5 years. So those aren't 24-hour IPs or 7-day or 30-day. That's 1.5 years worth of data.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then very quickly, in Bradford County where you've got the non-operator position, is that the acreage that's held by production? Or do you see any acreage exploration issues given the lack of drilling because of pricing?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, one I'd like to point out, that whole position is about 14,000 acres. So it's really small, it's relative to the over 1 million acres net that we have in the state. It's a tiny, tiny fraction. And a lot of it's held -- maybe a little bit of the 14,000 goes away. Now that's in the dry gas area and they've actually gone down to 0 rigs in that area.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ron Mills from Johnson Rice.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "Ray, just a quick follow-up on Brian's question on the RCS. Can you give us a sense in terms of what -- how many more clusters are you doing per stage under the RCS method versus your prior method?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, I don't know that we're locked into a specific spacing between clusters yet. But I can tell you, I think most of the recent stuff we're doing is we've gone from 3 clusters -- originally in our completions we were 3 clusters spaced 100 feet between. Basically, 3 clusters in a 300-foot interval. Now we are 3 clusters in a 200-foot interval. But that could change. We've experimented, I think, all the way down to 150 and we've actually even got longer than 300, again trying to figure out what the optimum is.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And from a lateral placement, can you talk about what you're doing differently and add a little bit -- maybe provide a little bit more color on what the analysis suggested in terms of why you're changing the placement of the lateral? And how much of an impact do you think that the simple lateral placement could have on the EURs or well performance?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, I think, being a guy that's frac-ed a bunch of wells in my career, a year or so ago, what I said, it wouldn't make any difference where you land the lateral because we're going to bust it all up when we frac it. But today, I'll tell you that the guys have made a real impression on me that it does make a big difference. And I think it has to do with a lot of complicated things, which I won't go into here because it would take the rest of the call and we don't want to give away our secrets. But essentially, it's a lot of analysis of rock mechanics and characteristics of the rock that determine how the fracture initiates and actually how it produces in the early stages of the well life and so forth. So we're confident that we are seeing definite improvements by better targeting. It is going to be different across the play. Again, the Marcellus is a huge play. And just driving from one side of wet to the other side of the super-rich is -- that's an hour drive in a car. So it's a big area and it's going to change a lot. What's critical is, just like Jeff talked about earlier in his remarks, is just seeing that the technical team, given more time and more data and allowing them to use the tools and the diagnostics that they want to, has really paid off for us. And I fully expect that we'll keep seeing improvements going forward.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "Great. And then shifting down to the Permian. Is it fair to assume based on the comment that the Cline covers the whole position that this -- that the Wolfberry portion of the play is combined to the Western portion of your Conger field?", "Ray N. Walker", "That's exactly right. That is fair.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "That's why we gave you a well count rather than acreage. We think it's 100 to 150 at 40s and obviously, 200 to 300 at 20s.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "Indeed. Do you think there's something going on as you're at that eastern portion of the basin that's different than what the industry has been doing in -- whether it's rocks or whatever given that those wells versus a typical Wolfberry well is significantly higher? Or was there something Range-specific, in terms of operations, that you think drove those results?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, we've only done a handful of wells. And so I would hazard to say that we're any better than anybody else. But I do -- it's probably more of the rocks than anything else right there. But again, like Jeff said, that's why we put the well count out there. It's not huge, but it's definitely significant and it's a great opportunity and something our technical teams did really well. They looked at a concept and figured out a different way to approach it and made us some great rate of returns. It's a great way to ramp up some oil production and we're excited. Once we get in there drill a couple of more wells, I think we'll have a great opportunity going forward to really ramp up some oil production there.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, to me there's 2 things that are exciting. Regardless of the reason, I'm always excited when our wells are performing really well. And like Ray said, initially, it's probably the quality of the rock and the fact that we hopefully can repeat that across multiple opportunities. In aggregate, when you look at -- say, we have 300 wells to drill, it's not going really to drive our reserves or resource potential but it can really significantly drive our oil production over the next 1 year or 2 or 3 or 4. And that's the exciting part about it is more high-rate opportunities are really working in today's environment. Plus it's, in essence, free acreage. It's back to having stacked pays high-quality technical team. It's nothing we acquired. It's something we had. And then you got all the efficiencies. We've got a field office out there. We've got pumpers, people on the ground. It's the same technical team, so it really helps economically.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from RBC Capital Markets.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I'm just wanting to see if you had any thoughts why the latest 4 wells of Northeast Pennsylvania and average 22 million a day were so still strong here?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, I think our -- I think it's several things. I think our technical team is just getting better and better at understanding the rock and where to land the lateral and just all of the things that go with that. And I think the rock is just phenomenal. I mean Northeast Pennsylvania has probably got the best, in my personal opinion, it's not a Range opinion, my personal opinion, the best dry gas rock in the world. I mean, there's some huge wells up there. And again, those wells are only 3,000-foot lateral lengths and with 10 stages. If you -- there's no doubt that if we were drilling 5,000- or 6,000-foot laterals, I mean, those wells will be incredible. So I think that it's just a combination of all those things. But again, it's primarily just a rock. The rock rules, and understanding that opportunity and how best to capture it is a real testament to our technical team. We took a really experienced technical team out of the Barnett and we assigned that project to them 1.5 years ago or so. And they've literally gone from essentially 0 to where they're at today, bringing on wells. Those 4 wells is just unbelievable amount of volume. That was almost where we were at the Barnett after 4 or 5 years. So it's pretty phenomenal to see that happen.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, I think just a fact to that simple comment, not only you need to be in the right place but you need to be in the right part of the right place, in the core area. So we've got a huge position and really dominate the wet part of it, or super-rich, where the economics are strong. But even in the dry, we've got, I think, some of the best acreage out there coupled with first-class technical team working it. And a pretty good Chief Operating Officer, too.", "Ray N. Walker", "And a great CEO.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And did you guys use RCS on those wells? And what were the costs associated with those [indiscernible]", "Ray N. Walker", "We did not use RCS on those wells.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "So yes, there's upside in terms of, like Ray said, longer laterals, more stages, RCS, can we land them in an even better spot, all those types of things.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And what did those cost you to drill?", "Ray N. Walker", "Those will also -- they'd be right in line with what you're see in the investor presentation. And as I got so many numbers in my head, I can't pull it off at the top of my head. But $6.2 million on a lot of them.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, that means we're -- they were like 3,000-foot laterals. So you're probably ballpark-ish $5 million...", "Ray N. Walker", "$5.5 million. $5 million to $5.5 million, I guess.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "The economics are right on the website like we said.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess just looking out South of Pennsylvania, you talked about capacity constraints there. And can you give us a little more color on what you guys are doing to address that?", "Ray N. Walker", "I'm sorry, say that question one more time.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Can you give us more color on what you guys are doing to address capacity constraints in Southwest Pennsylvania?", "Ray N. Walker", "At Southwest Pennsylvania, look, the capacity strengths -- constraints that I was talking about on that one particular pad -- by the way, let me retract on the 2,600-foot laterals with 9 stages are $4.3 million. So we're probably just a little above that actually, on those particular oil wells that we're just talking about. But the capacity constraints in Southwest PA that I was referring to on that one example I was talking about in my prepared remarks, that was really associated with that one pad. We just really never anticipated that strong wells coming out of one pad. So they had not put enough compression capacity there to handle that, and that's what it was. So essentially, the guys added some more equipment, piped some things up to different ways, put some more separation equipment online and that sort of thing. And that got us going forward. Overall in Southwest PA, we're in great shape. I mean, Mark West has just done a fabulous job. Of course, there's certain things that we'd like to have faster and certain things that they would like for us not to change our mind so often. But to make a long story short, they've done a great job, they're out in front of us. And the most important thing I can say to you is we're well on track to meet our goals this year. We don't see any issues in the infrastructure side that will keep us from getting there.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "That's great. I guess, what are your well costs right now in Southwest PA on average in the different areas?", "Ray N. Walker", "The straightaway laterals, just like we heard got in the investor presentation are running about $4 million. Of course, we are working on longer laterals, we're also working on the RCS completions. We're putting more frac stages in. So you're going to see those prices go up and down as we incorporate those different techniques in the well designs. But the standard well today is about $4 million. What's important is, is with the efficiency improvements that we're seeing and the reduced service pricing that we're recognizing in that area, we expect those prices to continue to go down. But as typical, what the guys will figure out how to do is use the money that we're saving to invest back in more wells, more frac stages and more perforation clusters or all of those things. And again, all of that, we've seen what they've done over the last couple of years and they just continue to get better and better return on investments. And that's what it's all about.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes and just referring again to the presentation, you can go online and look at it. And we give you a couple of examples, for like Ray said, say a straightaway well down there, it's about a 3,000-foot lateral in 10 stages, it's about $4 million. And then in the super-rich example, which was the average of the 8, they were about 3,700-foot laterals with 14 stages, and they're about $4.7 million. But like Ray said, that will -- how we complete the well will dictate what the cost is. But the good news, even if the cost -- if we go towards longer laterals reduce cost during higher well cost, we're doing that because it generates higher rates of return.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Magner from Macquarie.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "We recently saw you all do a farm-out transaction of some acreage in the East Texas Eaglebine play. Is that something that we might see more of in the future? And if you can give us an update on your appetite around or interest in JV transactions as you look to accelerate or optimize development some of what might not be near-term priorities for Range?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, I think if you'd stand back and look at us, we've been pretty open-minded about what to do with our assets. To start with, from 2004 through 2011, we sold $1.8 billion worth of properties. The biggest piece of which last year was the Barnett for $900 million, and we did roughly a year ago. And like Ray said, importantly through our technical teams and the robustness of our portfolio, we basically made the production out by the end of last year. We're open-minded on what to do. The example you gave, we had some properties down in Walker County. We had identified an opportunity, got out in front of the pack, leased some acreage and probably all in for under $200 an acre or less. When we drilled one well on it, we never were able to put together a sizable position in the play. And it ended up being fairly deep and fairly expensive wells. When you stand back and look at it before we did the deal, it was an area we were never going to fund probably. So what we did is we fund it out, kept the 25% interest. We have a carry-through tanks, we have a override across the entire position. And that's more important to somebody else than it is to us right now. Just like the Barnett, it got to the point in our portfolio -- if you go back to 2006, '07 and '08, it was a big driver. But it got to the point last year, we never were going to fund it. The rates of return were so much better in the other areas, we weren't going to get to it. So we've been very open-minded in terms of farm-outs, selling properties and whatever we think maximizes our share price.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And would JVs be of interest? In the past, there's been some reluctance to look into those types of transactions, but is that going to change hereon?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I think, again, it's just a matter of what the opportunity is. So to the extent we think things like that make sense, we'd consider it. So far we haven't seen an opportunity that we think is the right thing to do, therefore we haven't done one.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And just any updates on spacing assumptions? Any of your sort of top 5 plays with discussions around increased lateral lengths and changes to some of the completion designs. Like on the last call, you provided kind of a rundown of at least near-term spacing assumptions. I'm just curious how you're looking to make any changes or tests, any down spacing opportunities?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I think that's a really good question and it has far-reaching implications, and I'll sort of walk through some of the areas. If you start with the Marcellus, we're basically drilling the Marcellus on 80-acre spacing. And when you look at the resource potential numbers in there, as large as the numbers are, 2 things I'd like to point out. A lot of our acreage is derisked. And in Southwest, you got over 90% of the acreage derisked from over 1,400 wells. And back to our discovery well for the play, production came on in 2005. So you got 7 years worth -- up to 7 years worth of history on 1,400 wells. We're drilling them on 80-acre spacing. And we put a couple of pilots in on 40-acre spacing down there a couple of years ago, so we got a plenty of data. When you look at the resource numbers that are in there, in aggregate, they're probably assuming in the Marcellus, roughly a 30% recovery factor, plus or minus. I would argue, if you look at that, when you look at recovery factor, it's going to come down to the quality of rock and the spacing that you've drilled on and the efficiency of the completions. If you use the Barnett, which is the oldest of these types of shale fields, as an analogy, in the best parts, in the core parts of the Barnett, people have drilled it down to as tight as 20-acre spacing, granted it's thicker, but they drill it down to as low 20s and got recovery factors on the order of 50%. We're at 80-acre spacing, it's not unreasonable to think that at some point in time you couldn't go to 40s and that our recoveries could double or we could drive through tighter spacing, better completions and all that type of thing. Recovery is up into the 50% range. That is an enormous upside given the amount of acreage we have. And it's in one of the highest rate of return plays in the U.S., tremendous upside. So I'm excited about that. As you go to the horizontal Mississippian, and again on our website, we talked about the first 8 wells. Ray just updated you with 2 more. And they're actually performing better than the first 8. As we get more data eventually, we'll update the curves like we have everywhere else. If you look at that slide, those 8 wells -- even those first 8 wells averaged 485,000 BOEs at a depth of about 4,200 feet. At strip pricing, that's a rate of return of 86% to 99%, tremendous rates of return. With that, under that current completion, it equates to a recovery of about 4% to 9% of the oil in place. And assuming we kept those laterals, it's a little -- it's about 55-acre spacing. So do I think -- and this is oil, not gas. So in oil, typically, it's more viscous fluid. You can drill on tighter spacing. You got a lot of oil in place. I think that it's not inconceivable in an oil play to maybe even drill tighter and to double recoveries, maybe 4% to 9% becomes 8% to 18%. And then I think when you stand back and look at that, again, enormous implications. We have 145,000 acres. If you use a spacing like that, you could be talking about something as high as 2,800 wells, plus or minus 2,700, 2,800 wells. And then if you use 0.4 million, 0.5 million barrels per well equivalent, you're talking about over 1 billion barrels net of range. If you double it through tighter spacing, you generate some enormous numbers. We're not that big of a company. Again high rate of return play, really strong technical team, stacked pay area. So you're spacing question is a good one. And then you could take that into the Cline or the Wolfberry or other areas. But anyway, I'll just stop there. It's very exciting upside but we're really not counting much, so good question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit from BMO Capital Markets.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Can you review for me the targeted economics of the vertical Wolfberry, just the recoveries and the drilling complete costs?", "Ray N. Walker", "Currently, what I did see in those wells, the vertical Wolfberry wells are at about $2.8 million. The technical guys believe they could get that down significantly to the $2.4 million range pretty quick. What we are reluctant to talk about yet is the EUR of those wells. It's just simply too early, and we're definitely excited about it. They compare favorably to the offset operators. But that kind of gives you a flavor for what we're doing. And again, our plan is to drill 2 more of those. Across the summer here, we'll drill one. We'll go drill 3 of the horizontal Cline wells and then back to drill a second to additional vertical Wolfberry well. But they're completed, 11 to 12 stages. Again, the vertical -- so that kind of gives you, I think, a framework of what we're looking at.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And we also -- we gave you the 24-hour rates of the sales, we gave you the 90-day rate on the older well. And if you compare that again, I mean it's only a 2-well data set and with not a lot of history. But it looks good. Right now, it looks very encouraging. But rather than put reserves, I would rather see at least another quarter's worth of data before we put it out. But so far, it looks great.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Got it. And then turning to Northeast PA, how much of the 180,000 net acres is held by production today? What's the expiry schedule look like, I guess, over the next 12, 18 months or so? And what's the capital commitment involved?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "We're really in good shape. If you got on the website, it will show you there's about 51% HBP currently. And those are big leases up there. We feel -- and they have -- what they have on them are continuous drilling clauses. I always use the example of biggest leases, 20,000 acres or more. And literally, you can drill one well per year and hold it forever as long as you do that. And most of the leases are 1,000, 2,000, 6,000 acres. So 1 to 1.5 rigs will hold all the acreage that we want to hold, which is the core part of it. So we're really in pretty good shape there. Really, if you think -- if you step back even further and look at what do we need to drill the hold, what we really need to drill the hold is Southwest PA in the wet and in the super-rich. Southwest PA in the dry is held by legacy historical production either from the Upper Devonian, Oriskany [ph] or wherever. So the dry part is pretty much held down there. Where we need to drill the hold is wet and super-rich Marcellus and the horizontal Mississippian. It also happens to be where our highest rate of return projects are. So fortunately, we're blessed and those are lined up. That's where we'd spent our money anyway because those are our best rates of return.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, and I'll just add on. Drilling in Southwest PA, when we drill the Marcellus though, we're actually holding the acreage for the Upper Devonian and the Utica below that. So we HBP everything when we drill a well there.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, I knew these wells to any depth holds all horizons. And obviously, the value in the Utica, we think, is going to be in the wet up in the Northwest, and we'll be testing that this summer down the road. I can't tell you whether it's X years, but there's a tremendous dry gas reserves underneath all that stuff down in the Southwest. A lot of that acreage is prospective for dry Utica that at someday will be worth a lot.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, we don't have any of that dry Utica in any of our numbers anywhere so...", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Right, I got it.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Nor do we have any of the wet Utica.", "Ray N. Walker", "That's true. We don't have any Utica.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, none in any of our resource numbers that we've released publicly.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then, what was the price deck the banks supplied in this latest redetermination?", "Roger S. Manny", "It starts at about 275 for 2012. That's the agent's deck and it escalates from that. So obviously, we'll probably see some adjustments to that later this year. But they will forward your first slug of production to the next redetermination date. So a lot of that 2012 price wasn't really germane.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Right. And can you speak to or maybe you can give some guidance on what the ratio of long-term debt to EBITDA actually look like over the balance of this year to 2013. What's your comfort level or your discomfort level?", "Roger S. Manny", "Yes, Dan, we're comfortable basically 3 and under. It eats up just over 3x right before we sold the Barnett. So when you see it get up with the 3 on the front, we are usually working on something to get it back down. Right now,  it's at 2.6. So I think you'll see it kind of hover around that 2.6 range for the rest of the year, maybe a little higher, just depending on how things drill out.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Neil Dingmann from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions. After that phenomenal result, you talked about the 24-hour rate you're just reading on the 700 BOEs per day and then obviously the 1,500 if you include the condensate, does that make you at all think about changing the drilling schedule or anything for the remainder of the year, or is there still just too much to define there?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, you know, wells like that's what actually started making us change or grow the schedule a while back. The drill schedule is continually getting optimized. And what we're trying to do, like we do in all areas is again, especially in this environment, it's critical just to try to get the best return wells that we can drill. And so every time we find wells like this, we of course will immediately look for offsets and look for opportunities, try to figure out how we can duplicate that as many times as possible. And if we have the ability to shift a lower rate of return well that was maybe not as rich or something like that back into this area, we would certainly do that throughout the year. But as we go further, your ability to change anything that's going to impact production this year becomes less and less, just simply because we're a much bigger ship than we used to be trying to turn and change directions very frequently. That's exactly what we're trying to do, is find more wells like that.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And it helps set up an exciting 2013.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Well, would you all say you -- it does sound like there is, if you do decide to ramp that up even a bit latter part of this year, there is enough capacity to do so?", "Ray N. Walker", "You mean as far as infrastructure capacity?", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Correct.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, absolutely. We are well ahead on process and capacity. And all of the gathering and compression, looks like it's -- I mean, we're -- the guys are continually working with the MarkWest team on that. And we're well out in front, so we're in good shape there.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay and then on -- switching over to Utica, what are you thinking as far as forecasting for well cost there?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I'd just say that's way too early. The guys are still working on the design of the initial well. But when we get all that, we'll put that out.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, we're going to do some science, of course, too, which would not be normal on this first well.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "But it's a really exciting opportunity. It's at the right depth, right thermal maturity and a big 190,000-acre blocky position that should be in the wet and condensate area.", "Ray N. Walker", "I'm just going to say in more confirmation, there's just a lot of knowledgeable people all around us up there. So we're at the point where we just left with the decision. We just got to drill some wells now and see what we got.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. And the same thing, we got a great team on the ground. We have a field office that's a historical producing area for us, so we're in good shape.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then last one just turning over to the horizontal mix, just wondering, it does sound like in the latter part of the year, you anticipate ramping the number of wells there. Just looking at the water disposal, how is that addressed? Or kind of how you see the costs for that going forward?", "Ray N. Walker", "We, today, are -- the horizontal producers are about $2.9 million. That's actually what they're spending today. We are allocating about $200,000 a well for saltwater disposal. And that could run between 8 -- one well can handle between 8 to 12 wells. And I think only time will tell as we ramp that project up. But we got a great disposal zone, we got a great infrastructure, we've been very disciplined in our leasing program to try to stay very consolidated. And what we know about that play is operating cost is really going to be a key thing there, so we've really been disciplined. And I think at this point, the saltwater disposal infrastructure is coming together nicely. We don't see any issues. But of course, we've only got first 2 wells online. So we're going to be watching that real closely. And certainly as we get towards the end of the year and into next year, you're going to see that ramp up significantly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Carver from Capital One South Coast.", "Marshall H. Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions. When will your acreage in Southwest PA, the wet and super-rich, be held by production?", "Ray N. Walker", "We should -- our plan is over the next 3 or 5 years, we'll get there. Some leases -- a big portion of the leasing capital that we have in our $1.6 billion budget goes to Southwest PA. And it's just simply filling in holes and blocking up, what I call blocking and tackling as we're drilling through that area. So it's hard to talk about absolute black-and-white numbers when things will be HBP because we'll be continually adding new leases as we get opportunities to bolt on. But we should substantially have all of that done in the next 3 to 5 years.", "Marshall H. Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division", "And in terms of the new improved completion techniques and lateral placement designs this year, what percentage of the wells that you're drilling this year in the wet and super-rich would you say going to use this new improved techniques versus old techniques?", "Ray N. Walker", "That's a great question, Marshall. And to be just flat honest with you, I don't have an answer yet. Give me another quarter, and I think we'll have those plans locked down. What the team is physically doing today is going through and just seeing how much of that we can add into this year's program. But just like we talked about earlier, every time we do more of that, it does cost more money. So we -- we're going to stay within our $1.6 billion capital budget and we're absolutely not going to spend more than that. So it's really a juggling act of where does it make sense to do it. It's certainly -- we're certainly not at a point where we can say it just -- blank it, makes sense to do it everywhere we go. But we'll be doing enough of it. Well, let me say it in another way, we'll be doing as much of it as we can. And I think in probably another quarter, I could give you a range or a percentage of the wells that we'll be doing those techniques on going forward.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And I think the key, again remembering the old techniques in the wet area where 3 years worth of data on almost 200 wells generate about a 75% rate of return, which is pretty exciting. And in the wet area, based on the first day, it's about 95. These are enhancements to that. I think what you'll see in time, into 2013, '14, '15, like Ray said, you're going to see, I think, continuing improvement.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, let me add even more to that. We're also taking what we're learning there in the Marcellus and we're actually talking to the Oklahoma City division office about it and even the West Texas guys and seeing if any of those techniques makes sense to try in the oil plays in the horizontal Mississippi or the Cline.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. And remember in the Cline, we're 2 wells into it on a 100,000 net acres.", "Operator", "We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Mike Scialla from Stifel, Nicolaus for our final question.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I think you said you had 7 rigs running in the super-rich area, and how many total do you have in the Southwest PA now?", "Ray N. Walker", "Today, there's 9 rigs total running in Southwest PA.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So are those 2 that are in the wet area, I presume, is that kind of a good run rate to hold that area going forward, and you'll continue to concentrate on the super-rich?", "Ray N. Walker", "It's going to go up and down, Mike. I mean, there's -- I don't have those averages because just like what we were talking about a little while ago, as we're -- as these new wells are coming online and we're starting to figure out what the potential is, you have to look at things like HBP, you have to look at infrastructure development and where does it make sense to change our plans in new rigs from the wet to the super-rich. So you're going to see that go up and down quarter-to-quarter. We may have more rigs running in the wet area for a quarter than we do in the super-rich going forward. So it's just going to ebb and flow. And so I don't think you could hold that flat. I think the only thing you could hold sort of flat would be in that 7 to 9 rig range throughout the year or so in Southwest PA.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then along those same lines, if I look at the resource potential numbers you guys put out there, it looks like you expect the Upper Devonian to have a higher liquids content than the Marcellus, kind of looks like 300 barrels per million versus 200 barrels per million. One, I guess, am I reading that right? And if that is right, is there a chance we could see a shift, more emphasis towards the Upper Devonian going forward?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, I think it's apples and oranges because the Marcellus is the entire Marcellus, which is all the dry acreage in Northeast PA and along with the dry acres in Southwest PA plus the wet and super-rich areas. The Upper Devonian is really concentrated to the wet and super-rich areas. And we really don't have much of the upgrade in either for the super-rich types, as you know. We got -- simply we just got to see some more results before we do go that far.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And it's so early in the Upper Devonian. The recovery factor for using there is even significantly less. So until we get more data -- what we'll do is continually update it with time.", "Operator", "We've come to the end of our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for closing comments.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Okay. Before I give my closing comments, I'd like to note that we have several more questioners online that we weren't able to get to. So I would encourage you to give us a call, and we want to make sure we follow-up and answer your questions along with anybody else that might have some, so make sure to do that.", "But for the closing comments, I'd like to close with what I believer are the 4 main takeaways for Range. First, we have a very large acreage positions in some of the best plays in the country. Given the acreage we have, we should be able to achieve double-digit growth in production and reserves on a per share basis, debt-adjusted, for many years. ", "Second, given the high quality of our acreage in the plays that we're in, we should continue to be one of the lowest cost producers in our peer group. Third, as Roger just discussed, we have significantly strengthened our financial position and are in a solid position to fund our capital program. ", "Finally, the 5 enhancements to our portfolio, the super-rich Marcellus, the super-rich Upper Devonian, the wet Utica, the horizontal Mississippian oil play and the Cline Shale oil play, all offer significant upside to the Range story. Additional news on all these plays will be coming on our second, third and fourth quarter calls. I believe these 4 keys will drive shareholder value for years to come.

I'll begin with an overview of the quarter. Ray will follow with an operations update, and Roger will be next with a discussion of our financial position. Then we'll open it up for Q&A.", "Range is on track to achieve the targets that were set for 2012 for overall production growth and capital spending. Our capital expenditure budget for 2012 was on track and remains unchanged.", "Our production growth target of 30% to 35% now has moved to the high side of the range and is 35%. Our exit rate for the Marcellus should be 600 million cubic feet equivalent per day or greater. Our liquids production growth target was delayed to permitting issues. However, we expect for the fourth quarter that liquids growth will be 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2011.", "On the costs side, our teams are doing an excellent job and costs are coming in better than expectations. LOE per Mcfe continues to decline dramatically from $0.60 per Mcfe in 2011 to $0.48 in the first quarter of 2012 and $0.40 in the second quarter of 2012. Our total cash cost per Mcfe is also following the same downward trend from $2.61 in 2011 to $2.50 in the first quarter of 2012 and finally, to $2.38 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2012.", "Our DD&A per Mcfe has also been reduced from $1.80 per Mcfe in 2011 to $1.67 in the first 6 months of 2012. These are both very impressive numbers and a very impressive trend. Our teams are also making important progress on the marketing side of our business. We continue to negotiate on the third ethane solution and we believe we are close to finalizing the deal. In addition, we're well-hedged for the remainder of 2012 and '13 for all 3 products, gas, oil and natural gas liquids. The details of our hedge position are listed on our website. This includes how we've hedged both the light and heavy end of the NGL barrel.", "As we continue to focus on optimizing our portfolio we have engaged RBC Richardson and Barr to market our Ardmore Basin Woodford properties. We have about 9,300 net acres of liquids-rich Woodford properties that are currently producing about 12.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day, of which about 54% is liquids. Our Ardmore Basin Woodford properties are high quality properties. However, our current focus in the midcontinent is on our horizontal Mississipian play where we are achieving outstanding results. The position we have in the horizontal Mississippian consists of 152,000 net acres and therefore has much greater upside per share.", "In addition, although the rate of return in the Ardmore Woodford is very good, the rate of return in our horizontal Mississippian play is even better. The decision to market the Ardmore Woodford properties, assuming we find a buyer that recognizes the value in these properties, both increases our focus and fast-forwards the value we would have received from these properties. The results we're achieving in the horizontal Mississippian play continue to improve and impress. The average result of our 2012 drilling program is significantly better than our first 8 wells. You can view the 2012 curve as compared to the first 8 wells on a slide included in our current IR presentation on our website.", "Also during the second quarter, we drilled our first horizontal Mississippian well in excess of 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Its peak 24 hour rate was 1,363 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The liquids portion of this rate was 1,122 barrels per day comprised of 782 barrels of oil per day and 340 barrels of natural gas liquids per day.", "We're also making good progress in the super-rich and wet areas in the Southwest portion of the Marcellus along with the dry gas portion of Northeast Pennsylvania. In particular, we just recently completed a new well in the super-rich area that flowed at a rate of 5.7 million cubic feet of gas per day and 1,000 barrels of liquids per day, of which 55% is condensate. Ray will discuss these areas in more detail and he'll also update you on our first 2 Upper Devonian wells in the superrich area in Southwest Pennsylvania.", "In addition, we're currently drilling our first Utica well in Northwest Pennsylvania and started drilling our next series of Cline Shale and Wolfberry wells in West Texas.", "There's one other area that I especially want to mention. To date we've given you production plots for the dry gas area in Northeast Pennsylvania and the wet and super-rich areas of Southwest Pennsylvania. In our IR presentation on our website, it states that we have 570,000 net acres in Southwest Pennsylvania. We believe approximately 335,000 net acres here are perspective for wet or super-rich Marcellus and 235,000 net acres are perspective for dry gas. We haven't talked much about this significant dry gas position, but recently, we drilled and brought online 2 pads that are just on either side of the wet dry line of 1,050 Btu gas. One is just on the dry side and has 1,040 Btu gas. This dry gas pad has 5 wells that average 14 million cubic feet per day per well for an average initial 24-hour rate to sell, and it appears the reserves for these wells will average 7 to 8 BCF each.", "The other Pad is just over the wet dry line and has a Btu content of 1,065. This 10-well pad has an average IP of 13.7 million per day for its initial 24-hour rate to sale and also appears to have average reserves of 7 to 8 BCF per well. These 2 pads are about 35 miles apart. My point is that we've tested over a dozen wells on the edge of the dry side of our acreage in Southwest Pennsylvania and we believe the quality of these wells is excellent.", "Our teams continue to deliver outstanding results in the field. Financially, Roger and his team are very disciplined and focused on maintaining our liquidity and strong financial position in order to run the business. Our hedges are a key component of our strong financial position, which allows us to execute our capital program as planned, keeping Range financially strong while we grow reserves and production per share will always be a key principle of our business plan.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.", "Ray N. Walker", "Thanks, Jeff. Today I'm going to talk about production, efficiency improvements and give some additional highlights on our activity.", "Let me start with production. We exceeded our second quarter production guidance, coming in well above guidance on gas and oil but lower-than-expected NGL production. The lower NGL growth was primarily due to permitting delays for pipelines and string crossings in Pennsylvania. The good news is these permitting issues have been resolved by overcoming the residual impacts of the policies that were left over from the previous administration. We give a lot of credit to DEP leadership in Harrisburg for recognizing and then resolving these issues. We can now plan more effectively and we do not anticipate these permitting delays in the future. As a result, we fully expect to see substantial growth going forward as those delayed pads begin to come online. By the end of this year, we expect to reach 40% liquids growth when comparing the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011. Because of the delays, we will not hit our 40% full year over full year target, but we are back on track for impressive quarterly liquids growth.", "Guidance for the third quarter production will be 773 to 778 million cubic feet equivalent per day comprised of NGLs at 18,300 to 18,600 barrels per day, oil at 7,600 to 7,800 barrels per day and gas at 618 million to 620 million cubic feet per day.", "In addition to our record production, another key story I want to tell is how we're significantly improving efficiencies and costs while delivering better well results all across the company. Let me give you just a few of the many examples that we're seeing. In the Southern Marcellus, we've seen a 23% decrease in cost per foot drilled while drilling 22% longer laterals in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter. Also in the Southern Marcellus during the same timeframe, while pumping the same size jobs we've seen the completions teams perform 22% more frac stages while at the same time introducing initiatives that we expect will reduce completion capital for the remainder of this year by over $4 million. In the Northern Marcellus, drilling cost per foot has decreased by 21% from quarter 1 to quarter 2 and we've seen a 25% decrease in completion cost per stage by optimizing our completion designs.", "In our Midcontinent, the division in the horizontal Mississippian, we've seen a 25% decrease in drilling days, allowing us to effectively double the length of our laterals and increase the number of frac stages with a very modest cost increase. I'll give you more of those details in a few minutes.", "In our Permian division, we drilled 3 Wolfberry wells and have already seen a 24% reduction in total well cost. In Virginia, from 2011 to 2012, we've seen an 11% improvement in total well cost while drilling and completing 13% longer laterals in 26% less drilling days. We also continue to make great progress in our safety program. Our total recordable instant rate is 51% below our peer group and our lost time incidents are 35% below the peer group average. While we continue to strive for 0 incidents, we are really proud of our team and their focus on safety and environmental protection. That culture will play a paramount role in keeping us performing at a high-level while remaining a low cost and high rate of return producer.", "Now let me highlight some of the results that we're seeing across the company. Please refer to our press release as we list the results of some really great wells. I'm not going to repeat those results in my remarks here, but they are certainly noteworthy and some great wells that we are really proud of. Also, please refer to the new presentation on the website as we have specific details in there for all of our projects.", "In the super-rich Marcellus, we had a really nice well recently tested at 5.7 million gas and 1,000 barrels of liquids excluding ethane. We have now brought online 11 wells in the wet and super-rich area this year at over 500 barrels per day of liquids, not including ethane extraction. The super-rich and wet Marcellus continues to deliver excellent results. Jeff highlighted some very impressive dry gas well results, which give us a confirmation of the potential reserves for the 235,000 dry gas acres that we have in Southwest PA.", "In the Northern Marcellus, we're continuing to see outstanding results with good economics, also confirming the significant resource in place there.", "The Marcellus has proven to be a great asset across our entire position with class leading rates of return and tremendous resource potential. The horizontal Mississippian oil play likewise is progressing very well. Our team there is optimizing quickly. We're now drilling and completing approximately 4,000-foot laterals with more stages and making better wells, while seeing only a modest increase in total well cost to around 3.2 million, which is excluding the saltwater disposal. And we fully expect that those costs will come down even more as we get more wells under our belt.", "As shown in our new corporate presentation, our 2012 wells are performing significantly better than our previous wells, and although early, we believe that could be as much as 600,000 BOE wells. That would mean a 25% improvement in well performance with a very modest 10% increase in costs. This is amazing progress in only 6 wells.", "The team is continuing to optimize midstream and power infrastructure along with implementing improved saltwater disposal, production designs and operations. We believe our team can continue to produce these wells at very low operating costs compared to the more traditional designs, and we're already recognizing significant benefits in costs and efficiencies.", "In the first super-rich Upper Devonian Shale well, we confirm the 300-foot section with a similar volume of hydrocarbons in place as compared to the super-rich Marcellus. Given the thickness of this interval, which is 3x thicker than the Marcellus, and understanding that the shale is in multiple layers, where to land a lateral in the section is complicated. The first well tested at a 24-hour rate of 1.9 million equivalent per day, which was composed of 1.3 million gas and 116 barrels of liquids from a 3,300-foot lateral with 16 stages.", "Now let me put this in perspective. These results although less than we hoped to see, are significantly better than the first 4 horizontal wells that we drilled back in the Marcellus in 2006 and 2007. We learned early on in the Marcellus that targeting was important. And it took more than a few wells to figure that out and in fact, we are still optimizing our targeting in the Marcellus even today.", "From an appraisal standpoint, we are pleased with the data we've gathered from the Upper Devonian and the super-rich area. Mug log data indicates excellent gas shales, some of which are the best we've seen in the Upper Devonian section today. Log data shows substantial porosity and permeability, analysis of core intervals has documented large pore development in each of the key shale members, therefore validating excellent porosity and permeability development.", "Using what we've learned from the first well and analyzing all the data and diagnostics from both wells, we believe we have a better target interval in the second well. We've also optimized our lateral length and adjusted our completion design based on what we learned. We're now completing that second well and hope to be ready to discuss those results at our next conference call.", "Our first wet Utica well in Northwest PA is underway, and we still plan to spud a second test well in about October. We continue to monitor industry activity in the area and believe by the end of this year, we'll know a lot more about the potential of the wet Utica in our 190,000 net acres.", "In our Conger Field properties we've drilled 1 Wolfberry well which is being completed as we speak and we're drilling our third Cline Shale horizontal as we speak. Please take a look at the updated of Wolfberry economics in our presentation and as we've seen improved well performance as well as good cost reductions. Our Cline shale EUR average of the 2 producing wells is 340,000 BOE, and we've also updated those economics in our presentation. Plans are to drill 4 more Wolfberry wells and maybe one more Cline Shale well this year. We also see lots of offset activity in this area and are monitoring that activity as well.", "As you can tell, I'm really proud of our operating and technical teams. They continue to execute, innovate and improve efficiencies. Cost and well performance are steadily improving while working safely in protecting the environment. We're able to do more with less while getting better at what we do and we have some great rate of return projects. All of that combined should enable us to meet our production goals and grow at very attractive returns for many years to come.", "Now over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny", "Thanks, Ray. Like last quarter there are significant positive developments to discuss on both the income statement and balance sheet. The big income statement story is our continued progress in reducing operating and overhead costs without sacrificing per share growth in production and reserves. This was a great quarter where most of the recurring cost items all came in at or below guidance, and in some cases, significantly below guidance.", "Leading off with direct operating cost, the operating teams exceeded all expectations, with direct operating costs, including workovers, coming in at $0.40 per mcfe, that's $0.25 per mcfe below last year due to reduced water handling, equipment rental and well service expense. To help put this in perspective, on an absolute dollar basis, we spent $3.7 million less in direct operating expense during the second quarter this year compared to last year on 42% higher production volume. You're now seeing the benefits of focused growth from a continually high-graded asset base by employee shareholders who understand what is required of them in a low price environment.", "As we had additional oil and liquids rich production the rest of the year, absolute operating costs are expected to increase slightly with production and unit costs will likely also increase slightly. Next quarter, we believe we will see operating expense in the range from $0.42 to $0.44 in Mcfe.", "Third party transportation gathering and compression expense for the second quarter was $0.68 per mcfe, the same as the first quarter this year and $0.02 higher than the second quarter last year. We anticipate this expense to decline slightly on higher volume next quarter to between $0.63 and $0.65.", "Second quarter DD&A rate was $1.66 per Mcfe, slightly below guidance and $0.03 lower than the second quarter of last year due to changes in production mix and the Barnett assets held as discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2011. The steadily declining DD&A rate is further evidence of improving capital efficiency. We project DD&A next quarter to hover in the $1.66 to $1.68 range, again depending on production mix.", "Our listeners may recall that the way we're handling the new Pennsylvania impact fee guidance is to provide a specific absolute dollar quarterly estimate for the impact fee plus a quarterly production tax estimate for non-Pennsylvania production on a unit cost basis spread across total company production. The second quarter Pennsylvania impact fee was $7 million and production taxes on the non-Pennsylvania production reflecting lower on gas prices totaled $0.07 per Mcfe. For the third quarter, we expect the impact fee to be $6 million plus $0.10 per mcfe on total company production as we bring on more production in higher tax rate areas.", "Second quarter G&A expense, adjusted for noncash stock comp and other nonrecurring items, was $0.47, $0.12 below last year and $0.03 below the first quarter of this year. The decrease in year-over-year unit cost G&A expense is due to lower legal fees and lower unit cost, salary and benefit expense. Third quarter G&A expense per Mcfe is projected to be $0.46 to $0.47.", "Interest expense for the second quarter was $0.66 per Mcfe, $0.10 below last year's second quarter figure, with higher borrowing levels at slightly lower rates spread across higher production volumes. Exploration expense, excluding noncash comp in the second quarter, was $15 million, $4 million higher than the second quarter of last year due to higher seismic expenditures. We have additional seismic expense coming through in the last half of this year, making our best estimate for third quarter exploration expense approximately $20 million.", "The second quarter impairment on unproved properties was $44 million. Of this amount, $21 million was the ordinary calculated quarterly impairment expense and $23 million was a special provision attributed to an acreage high-grading transaction. In this transaction, we exchange our drilling rights and obligations on some non-strategic Marcellus acreage for Marcellus acreage in a high-quality derisked area where we're actively drilling. The net result was in our view a smaller number of higher quality acres. Next quarter, we expect unproved property impairment to be back in the range of $20 million to $22 million.", "Cash flow for the second quarter was $156 million. That's $12 million below the second quarter of last year. On a fully-diluted share basis, cash flow was $0.97, $0.02 above analyst consensus estimates. EBITDAX for the second quarter was $196 million, $5 million lower than the second quarter of last year. Cash margin for the quarter was $2.34 per Mcfe, and earnings, calculated using analyst methodology, were $18 million or $0.11 a share. That's $0.06 above the analyst consensus estimate, thanks to lower cost.", "As Rodney mentioned, our website contains a full reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP in addition to updated hedging schedules and other useful investor information.", "Turning briefly to the balance sheet, we began to draw upon our $1.75 billion credit facility in the second quarter to help fund the frontloaded 2012 capital program. At the end of the second quarter, we have 141 operated wells awaiting pipeline connection or completion. The capital spent on these wells approximates 1/3 of our total annual capital budget. Spending 1/3 of the frontloaded 2012 budget with no contribution to year-to-date production or cash flow, when combined with realized prices has taken our debt to EBITDAX ratio to 3x, a bit earlier in the year than you might have expected. And we remain comfortable with our leverage hovering around the 3x EBITDAX level, thanks to our high return plays, low cost structure, long reserve life, operating control of our growth assets and our favorable hedge position. However, as has been our practice, when our leverage exceeds the 3x level as it did before the Barnett sale in 2011, we will advise you as to how we intend to manage the leverage going forward. And as Jeff mentioned, we have commenced the marketing process for our Ardmore Basin Woodford shale properties, which when completed as we expect will help manage our leverage. Plus the same time fast forward net present value. EBITDAX should grow as completed already paid for wells are turned to sales and the combination of asset sales and higher EBITDAX should help bring the leverage ratio down toward the end of the year.", "Looking at our hedges for a moment. Range has continued to build upon its hedge position during the quarter by adding new hedges in 2012, 2013 and 2014. For the remainder of this year we have more than 80% of our projected gas production hedged at a floor price of $4.18 in an MMBtu approximately 60% of our NGLs hedged at above market prices and approximately 80% of our projected oil production hedged at a floor price of $91.19 a barrel. Please reference the hedging schedules on the Range website for the new and existing hedge volumes and prices.", "In summary, the second quarter demonstrates the commitment of all Range employee shareholders to meet the challenge of lower product prices by reducing an already low cost structure while still producing double-digit per share growth in reserves and production.", "Jeff, I'll turn it back to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Dave Kistler of Simmons and Company.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Real quickly on the comments about leverage that Roger made. As you start to look towards '13, in the past you've highlighted you can live within cash flow and deliver maybe 15% to 20% production growth. However, it seems like there is a willingness to go outside of cash flow. Should we be looking at that leverage metric to determine how far you guys would go outside in '13 or could there be a decision to start living within cash flow by '13? Any kind of color you can give us there would be great.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "This is Jeff. Let me start and then Roger will add his comments on at the end. So let me put it in context. Back to this year, we're taken it to a really high level. Our strategy is to stay focused on growing reserves and production per share within some of the highest rate of return and lowest cost plays out there. This year, we're looking at 35% growth outspending cash flow, and what most people would recognize are 2 of the best plays if not the best plays in the industry, the Marcellus particularly the wet part and the horizontal Mississippian oil play. So next year, and we won't set our budgets until later this year, but we're obviously we're working ahead and we're planning ahead. And we said it earlier this year, we have the opportunity if we choose to do so to live within cash flow and still grow 15% to 20%. And we believe we can still do that. So it sort of brackets off a couple of different slots here for where we are this year. If we choose to do that next year, we have that ability. But let me put that in context. I want to talk about it in a number of ways. One, another advantage of Range is we control or operate almost every area we have with the single exception really of Nora. So outside of Nora, we operate typically with a higher working interest or 100%. So we really have the ability even if we choose to live within cash flow next year, something close to cash flow to really shape our growth to what prices ultimately do in order to capture NAV. We have the ability and we have great operating teams led by Ray that can ramp up quickly if we choose to do so and capture NAV. If we keep spending down for a year, a year or 2 or a year, we have the ability to ramp up significantly and you can see this year what the quality of the portfolio can do. I think another key thing to really look at to is when you look at and if you go up to the 100,000-foot level and you look at the various plays that are out there, if we were strictly focused on maximizing growth in all these plays, the highest growth areas are the dry gas parts versus the liquid rich parts. And they're typically the thickest, gassiest highest pressure parts whether it's the Barnett Shale, the Marcellus or Haynesville, you pick it. So those are where you get the best growth. And what's really impressive is if you look at the quality of some of our gas properties that we've talked about, literally if we were only focused on growth, and we aren't, we're focused on rate of return and we're focused on a lot of other things, but if we only focus on growth what we would do is direct 100% of our drilling into the dry gas areas; and rather than growing within cash flow at 15% to 20%, theoretically you could probably double that, probably be 30% to 40% or where we are today. But importantly, what Range is, is really focused on maximizing rate of return. And given today that oil prices are high and gas prices are low, in order to maximize rate of return, what we're doing is focusing on liquids. In fact you can see us we're dropping rigs in the dry gas areas and focusing predominantly in the wetter, super-rich part of the Marcellus or horizontal Mississippian play. But I think a really key part, again bringing it back to Range, is Range is in a great position. We have great potential in both oil and gas. Just in the Marcellus alone, we have -- we talked about what we have in the wet and super-rich part. But if you look at the dry gas part in the Southwest, there's 235,000 acres plus another 180,000 in the Northeast. So we have 415,000 acres of dry potential in the Marcellus alone. And then if you look at the super-rich and wet combined just in the Marcellus that's 335,000 acres. We've got tremendous running room with really strong rate of return both ways with the ability and flexibility to direct our capital off into the future including the rate of production growth, plus we have 152,000 net acres in the horizontal Mississippian. So I'm reaffirming that we have the ability to do that if we choose to do so. We'll continue to work it through the end of the year. We'll look at the results of our projects. We'll put together a plan that we think optimizes value for our shareholders based on our core values of growth in reserves per share, production per share, both at adjusted rate of return, holding acreage, all those considerations, and we'll present that to our board in December. And typically, we've come out with our 2013 plans early in -- early in the 2013, whether we accelerate that a little bit and do it right at the end of this year or early next year like in previous years, we'll decide later this year. But Range is in great shape. We've got high rate of return projects in multiple areas. And what we're trying to do is just frac it off a little bit with some of the flexibility that we have. But let me turn it over to Roger to discuss further.", "Roger S. Manny", "Yes, just to comment on the leverage. I mean clearly the leverage in 2013 is going to be a function of where we set the drilling throttle and where oil and gas and liquids prices are as that -- going into next year. And since we haven't set the drilling throttle yet and we don't know where prices are going to be, it's a little hard to predict where the leverage is going to be. But we have committed to keep the balance sheet strong and that's what we're going to do. And as I mentioned, when the leverage gets in that 3x range while we're fairly comfortable in that range because of all the factors that I'd mentioned earlier in my remarks, we are going to tell you what we intend to do to manage it going forward. And in this case, that asset sale is a big part of that. So we'll see how the asset sale goes later this year. Then we'll see where the drilling throttle needs to be set. And then leverage will be somewhat of a byproduct of that. But when you look at the EBITDAX build that results from bringing these wells that aren't on production yet on production, that EBITDAX build will help to bring leverage down as well along with the asset sales. So we're very comfortable with the leverage where it is presently.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Great, I appreciate that color. And then maybe just one follow on, the Mississippian results that you kind of outlined both in your release and then in presentation on the longer laterals generating over kind of 100% rates of return at the current strip, it would seem to me it would make sense to be redirecting activity there than many of the other plays just from a rates return comment that you guys both made. Can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on that? Does that encourage you to buy more acreage? You added another 7,000 acres, but as -- should we look at this as becoming a much bigger part of the portfolio on a longer-term basis?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "This is Jeff. Let me start again and then Ray will probably add a little more color but yes, I think the key thing is to look at the position we've built. And you can go through some simple back of the envelope math that I've done with several of you at conferences. And that could be 1 billion to 2 billion barrels type of resource potential on upside. It's huge, particularly for a company our size coming with rates of return that you mentioned. So what you're seeing is we'll be increasing activity there. And we think it's a great play. We got a great team up in Oklahoma City that manages it. We've been in that area since 2004. So we've got infrastructure, office, good local knowledge. But I think what you'll see as we continue to drill and assuming continued success, which I believe we'll have, you'll see us ramp up activity throughout this year. And we haven't again -- we haven't set our budgets for next year and we'll continue to look at that and present to the board late this year. But it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that we could run something like in the order of 5 rigs next year and maybe the following year, 2014, maybe go into 10 and the following year to 15. If we follow a schedule like that, that allows us the opportunity to not only hold that acreage but really significantly ramp up our oil production NGLs. And you get great rich gas with that. So Ray you might talk a little bit about things we have in place and things we're doing to start leading us down that path.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, Dave, this is Ray. I think the results that we've seen so far this year are really impressive. Our guys have done a great job thinking through the future. And we did a really good job, we were really disciplined in the way we put those leases together up there. We stayed very disciplined in making sure they were consolidated because we knew handling saltwater and all those things was going to be big, play a big role in the economics of the play. So it's taken some time to really put a lot of those corridors together to put a lot of the plans in place to get the midstream infrastructure and power infrastructure and all of those things in place. And one of the things that we don't want to be guilty of is just going fast for the sake of going fast. And we're trying to take a very disciplined approach and ramp up as it makes sense to ramp up. In other words we don't want to bring rigs in, complete wells and then not be able to flow them. So we're really -- that play is really dictated a lot by handling a lot of fluid at really cheap prices to get that oil production. And so I think the guys have got an excellent plan. I'm really confident in what they're doing. And like Jeff said, I think we do have some pretty aggressive plans in the future to ramp that play up. Now I think you'll start hearing and seeing that as we get into the early part of next year, you'll start seeing that really happen pretty quickly.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "The other thing -- if you look on our website Ray talked about a very efficient plan that we have. There's a diagram in there that shows that. And the other thing when we finally release our specific detailed land maps that we have in the Marcellus I think you'll be impressed with the big blocky dominant position we have and obviously the early drilling looks great.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Great. I really appreciate the color. One just last one to sneak in. On the Miss Lime, how do you guys think about the NGLs and how are you going to manage that in that area of the country? I know you've been very focused on it up in the Marcellus, but any color you can give us with respect to NGLs pricing outlook around the Miss would be helpful.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, one I'd say, again, you get a nice, so we have a liquids component and a big piece of that is oil. We have 2 facilities in place able to handle and process liquids and NGLs and with the third one that will be up by the end of the year. So we have good diversity. We have a strong marketing team. And I think really we'll be in good shape there.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Brian Lively of Tudor Pickering Holt.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the 3x EBITDAX commentary. Just wondering if that is -- is that your covenant levels or is that just the internal comfort from the management team?", "Roger S. Manny", "Brian, it's Roger. Our covenant is 4 and a quarter, 4.25x. So it's clearly a management comfort level. We talked with rating agencies. Everybody is comfortable with us kind of being here in the low 3s. Using that financial flexibility, quite frankly, financial flexibility to us is a lot more than just having a $1.75 billion committed credit facility under a $2 billion borrowing base. It's the cost structure, it's the hedging, it's the operating control. As I say being able to set the drilling throttle where it needs to be. All those factors together make us very comfortable being in that low 3 range. But we're not going to come anywhere near the covenant limits. That's just not the way we do things.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Right, so if we're thinking about 2013, and I know it's a function of commodity prices, but do you guys expect to use the 3x debt to EBITDA sort of a throttle such that we would either have to look at slowing activity or doing more asset sales in terms to keep the leverage below that ratio?", "Roger S. Manny", "I think at this point it's a wait-and-see game. We'll see how the asset sale goes. And we'll just play it accordingly. I mean one of the big factors that's different about Range is when you look at our reserve to production ratio, whether on a total proved reserve basis or just approved develop basis, our ratio is about double the other shale players. And that's really indicative of the quality of our plays. And also the diversity of the plays. We have a lot of assets contributing a lot of value to the company. So we've sold $1.8 billion in assets in the last 10 years and we've not leveler our assets. So it comes down to making some of those hard decisions. We'll make them just like we always have.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, I think another key point too is our strategy has been growth at low cost on a per-share basis debt adjusted and really the other part, we say periodically and building high-grade the inventory. Like Roger said, over the years we've added in not only sold $1.8 billion worth of properties, we added in things like the Marcellus. We added in things like the horizontal Mississippian. I think in the future the St. Louis looks pretty exciting. We're looking at the Cline, the Utica, the Upper Devonian. So it's that constant process of building shareholder value by adding in higher quality plays and periodically divesting of things that are either no longer competitive in our portfolio or that we're not going to fund anymore even if they're quality properties like the Ardmore Woodford grade properties that's small position for us and it's going to be worth more to somebody else than us.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And are there any properties right now that you guys are thinking given the high grading that's happened? Are there any other properties that you can think of that are moving more to the non-core and could be monetized?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Sure, I mean we always look at our portfolio. We always we forward-frank it, we look at the upside, we look at the other potential. We make that decision. I'm not on the call today going to talk about what that is but yes, we absolutely -- Chad, Stevens and his team are on top of that.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay and just final question and I'll hop off. But if you were to keep CapEx flat in 2013 versus 2012, do you have a sense of what growth it would look like?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, I mean, one, we haven't made all those iterations. Like I said a lot of it ends up on where you end up focusing. If we focus in the liquids rich portion and we stay within cash flow, we would grow on the order of 15% to 20%. If gas prices moved up substantially and we added in a bigger component of that, you can see this year for that amount, we're drilling at 35%. Like I said, if you just focused 100% on dry gas, literally you could theoretically probably double the numbers we have. But it's early. Right now, I think we're doing exactly the right thing. We're staying disciplined. Oil prices are still high, gas prices are relatively low. Moving into our liquids rich areas in Southwest Pennsylvania and focusing on the high rates of return there, as well as the great rates of return like Dave Kistler mentioned earlier in the horizontal Mississippian, I think it's the right thing to do. The other thing is if you look at our company our size we're $9 billion to $10 billion company depending on the stock price in the day. We have got such a huge position that is predominately derisked and again you can look in our IR presentation, but we have literally got the opportunity to grow tenfold from where we are today. We're only a 5 TCF company and not counting ethane or those things, we have got the opportunity or resource potential to grow 44 to 60 Ts. And again some of the highest rate of return plays out there. If you focus in just on the Marcellus shale, we've got the opportunity and we're only a 5 TCF company. Our net resource potential in the Marcellus is 24 to 32 TCF. That's massive and it's largely derisked. This is a play now that is basically the largest gas field in the United States and recognized by most as the highest quality too. So we've got a great portfolio. We will continue to work it as we go throughout the year. We're working internally with the divisions on what we think maximize the shareholder value, present it to our board and then let you guys know, but we're in great shape.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Tameron of Wells Fargo.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Can you guys talk about your drilling plans in the Cline? It looks like you shipped a little bit from Sterling over to Glasscock. Is that -- can you just talk about the reasoning behind that if I have that correct?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Let me start out again and Ray may want to pile on and I probably shouldn't start every time, so I'm going to let Ray and Roger start some. I get excited, you can probably tell. If you look at our legacy, because really what you're describing is predominately our legacy position in Conger Field. Conger Field straddles the Sterling Glasscock line. So we've got a big position over 90% -- for about 90% of it's held by production. And so far, we're excited by our first 2 wells. The other neat thing is if you look at that is there's a lot of drilling off on the western side of us and Devon has a 500,000-acre position just East of us basically. So we're surrounded by -- and there is a slide on the website that Ray and Roger are looking at right now that shows our activity relative to Laredo and Concho and Devon and others that are out there. So what we've done literally is just or scattering a few wells across our acreage because the interval itself is relatively consistent. It's 270 to 330 feet thick across the entire 100,000 acres. And we believe it's got a lot of hydrocarbon in place. So what we're doing is just trying to look across a large area from our wells and we're going to factor in what our competitors are and partners and hopefully we'll share some data with them. And it's got great upside, great potential, but the good part there it's all HBP. So we're in -- we have no rush. And the other thing I like to say going into a higher level is it fits the Range model. We like to get in areas that have stacked pays, a lot of hydrocarbon in place that -- and get really high-quality technical teams that just continually work on how to extract more and more of it out of the ground. That's the same model in Appalachia, same in Midcontinent, same in West Texas for us.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So at the time being I'm just -- it looked like earlier you were planning to drilling some Sterling wells and they've moved -- all of your wells have moved further west. Is that an indictment of Sterling or is it just -- it's more of a...?", "Ray N. Walker", "Maybe I think we're mixing wells. If you look on our presentation on the slide, originally, we had 3 wells planned in Sterling County, those were Cline Shale wells. The wells on the western edge are Wolfberry vertical wells. And if you look at that slide, we've kind of got a little dashed line kind of circling where the potential is for that Wolfberry. In our last conference call we talked a lot about that -- how the Wolfberry vertical is really only potential over on the Glasscock County side. So what you've seen is with all of the offset activity like Jeff was referring to, we've basically are learning a lot from what's happening all around us. We've got tons of logs and scientific data all across this field. So we've logged the Cline Shale many, many times. And so really we're kind of in a validation mode, it's HBP. We don't have to be in a hurry. The Wolfberry wells are looking really good, and we can stamp those out quickly, like a good decent rate of return as oil production. And so all of those reasons, what you saw us do was shift a couple of those horizontal Cline test over into basically drilling Wolfberry wells while we have that rig out there. So if you're looking at Permian activity, that's probably what you're seeing.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And just to reiterate what Ray said. The entire 100,000 acres as perspective for Cline, it's perspective on the Western side. Still could be 100, 150, maybe 200 wells. But it's predominately the Wolfberry is just perspective on the side. Maybe that's what you're thinking.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "My bad. I think I misread that chart. One more question. Could you just like talk about Lycoming? And you originally talked I know if you go back 6 months, you talked about allocating a big chunk of CapEx next year to that county. Now it sounds like you're reducing the rig count and I guess because some of the issues you mentioned, but can you just talk about some of the challenges up there and why lay down a rig up in Lycoming?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "This is Jeff, I'll start. There are several considerations there. The wells up there are great. The team has done a great job of ramping up production. They're phenomenal. We've got wells that average 10 million a day, big reserves, some that are over 20 million a day, so we got a great position up there. But there's really 2 issues. One issue is giving -- even as good as the wells are, given where natural gas prices are versus liquids, if you look at on our website, you can look at the rates of return in the wet Marcellus in the Southwest and the super-rich and compare to Northeast. Even though the Northeast is good because there's a lot of liquids that come with the wells including condensate and NGLs in the Southwest where rate of return is higher. Then you got one other consideration too, is you got the drilling for holding acreage. The 2 areas, the only 2 areas really in the entire company, we have to really drill a lot the whole acreage is in Southwest Pennsylvania and in the horizontal Mississippian play. It so happens those are our 2 highest rate of return projects, so we'd be directing anyway. The leases up in the Northeast tend to be a lot bigger. So we're at a point where at the end of the year, really just by running one rig next year, there's continual drilling clauses because the leases are bigger and some of the leases are as big as 20,000 acres. So literally one well per year, we'll hold that in perpetuity. So there's no pressure to drill up there from holding the acreage that we want to hold the point of view, coupled with just where oil and gas prices are now. The good news is we got a great team. You got good economics up there. I believe gas prices -- some of the analysts on the call are calling for $4 gas next year or maybe $4.50 the year beyond, so we have really got the ability to ramp that also. Like I said earlier, we've got high quality gas assets. We've got high-quality oil assets and within gas, we've got high-quality wet gas and high-quality dry gas.", "Operator", "The next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Looking at the NGL production trajectory here. The production has been relatively flat the last couple of quarters and I just wondered, as we look ahead to the next few particularly in the fourth quarter where you expect more and more meaningful ramp-up. Do you have a lot of -- could you quantify the amount of NGLs, non-ethane that are currently behind pipe for from wells that have already been drilled, i.e. can you just kind of talk to wells that may have already been drilled, but from a propane and other NGLs perspective just aren't online today?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, if you look at the press release, I think it lists the number of wells that we've got in Southwest PA. And I think there's something like 56 wells waiting on completion and maybe something like 50 wells that are waiting on a pipeline hookup. Like I said in my prepared remarks primarily the delay in bringing those pads online has been pipeline infrastructure and that pipeline infrastructure has been delayed because of some permitting issues for the actual pipeline construction phase and the stream crossing part of that. The good news is we've resolved those issues. I mean to just come absolutely clean, we underestimated the impact of those, both West and Northwest early this year and we just didn't a allow enough time to get far enough ahead of those. So good news is we've worked with E&P leadership, they have resolved those issues. Now we have a predictable permitting process in place. We know how long it's taking. And moving forward, we don't expect to see that. I think another part of the good news and you'll see a significant ramp-up in NGLs in the third quarter and the fourth quarter is as we bring these pads online that were delayed, I mean they're literally sitting there just waiting for a pipeline to get there. And that part of it is really kicking into gear over the next quarter. It will be -- fourth quarter I predict will be much bigger than the third quarter just because it's going to take a couple of months for this stuff to start dominoing as we go forward.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "But we should have a great fourth quarter.", "Ray N. Walker", "Oh, yes, fourth quarter just like I said we believe we'll see when you compare fourth quarter this year to fourth quarter of last year, we will see 40% liquids growth.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And that's all from -- the incremental to get there is all from basically wells that have already been drilled and it's just an easing of the midstream bottleneck or some additional drilling or some wells that you're not sharing with the NGL component is, is still required?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, we're still drilling wells. So you still got new wells coming into the mix as we go. But yes, there is a big backlog of wells in the wet and super-rich area where we were really trying to ramp a lot of this infrastructure up in the last 6 months to 12 months or so.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then lastly going back to, I think it was David's question just before just to finish up on kind of Cline versus Wolfberry. Is your decision to move to shift to a little more towards vertical of Wolfberry from horizontal Cline because of a negative relative view on the Cline because or is it because you just think you're going to get the information that you would have otherwise been drilling that well from others -- other operators that are drilling around you?", "Ray N. Walker", "I would classify it as 2 things. One is we are seeing a lot of offset activity more than we previously saw earlier in the year. And we do expect to learn some from that. And then I think the second reason is the Wolfberry wells are looking pretty good. And the team is doing a great job. Costs are coming down. Just in 3 wells I think we saw like -- I forget the exact number of 24% cost reduction. And we believe that they're going to see significant cost reductions even in the next few wells. They've got some new ideas in drilling and completions. And so we really believe that the Wolfberry wells have looked so good. And since it's HBP acreage and we know a lot about all of that already in the Cline, it just made a lot of sense to redirect some of that capital to get some of these Wolfberry wells drilled upfront. And the just kind of take our time with the Cline, learn from the offset activity at the end of this year we can look at it. And we still have the potential to drill another Cline well before the year is out. Right now we've just kind of got that on the drawing Board.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I think another -- I agree 100% with what Ray said. Another point to add to that is when you look at shale plays -- I mean the Wolfberry is just comingling a bunch of traditional horizons together on the vertical well. The Cline shale is really a shale. So back to shale plays and you got this interval that's plus or minus 300 feet thick. Typically what happens in successful shale plays and not all shale plays work, but in the ones that do work and you can see it in all of them in Marcellus, Barnett, you pick it. And as you continue to drill and learn, the results tend to get better. When you learn how to -- where do you optimally land it vertically in the section, what's the length of lateral, number of stages and typically as you're learning how to drive up production per well, in over a number of wells typically then you get economies of scale and you drive down costs. For us it's held by production position that we're excited about. In fact, what we're really excited about it is that the first 2 wells rather than, for example, go back to the Marcellus, the first few wells there were awful. Our first couple of wells here actually were pretty good and were economic even off of our first couple of tries. So, if you project forward to -- if you drill that 100,000 acres on a 100 acres pacing could be 1,000 wells or 50, could be 2,000 wells. So there's a lot of running room. It's a very exciting play and early on, it looks like we got a big hydro -- saturated hydrocarbon section that the first couple of wells are good. But there's -- we don't have to carry 100% of the R&D like we did in the early years in the Marcellus. We'll drill some wells, but we'll also learn from our partners in the industry out there or other companies in the industry.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's great. And the strong vertical rates that you're seeing, is that a function of multiple or -- the multiple zones or are there specific zones like the Wolfcamp where you think down the road it may make sense to draw horizontally?", "Ray N. Walker", "It's a combination of all of them. I mean this is like any completion well out there, different areas show different results, but it's really a combination of all of it.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Not to say that down the road, that you won't zero in on the horizon and try some horizontal wells. I think that potential is there too.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, absolutely.", "Operator", "The next question is from Anne Cameron of BNP Paribas.", "Anne Cameron - BNP Paribas, Research Division", "Just a question about the Mississippian. You brought -- I mean you released your IPs or your first 2 wells and it looks like it was a breakout of about 60% crude. Yet your EUR is 25% crude. So I'm just wondering if you can comment on how fast the crude drops out of the production stream.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Let me start and then I will actually ask Alan Farquharson who is the head of engineering to comment. But when you look at it on a high-level actually I think we talked about 4 wells. And remember the combined rates for 4 wells and then we zeroed in obviously on the 1 that was well over 1,000 barrels per day. It had a very high oil rate in there. Again the neat part is very early on into the play. We had great results from 2,000-foot laterals. Now we've gone to own, at least that one, close to 4,000 foot with more stages. And it didn't cost a whole lot more, it's a packers plus type completion, so adding the stages and drilling the laterals isn't that expensive, though we've got significantly better results, shifting the curve up could be from 400,000 to 500,000 to 600,000 barrels. And therefore you can look at the add-on line and the rates of return much higher like David Kistler I believe mentioned earlier. But Alan, you want to zero in on those projections?", "Alan W. Farquharson", "I don't have the exact decline rate of the oil, but I think what you see is historically and a lot of these reservoirs since it's a relatively completions dry reservoir, you're going to look at oil declining and your gas oil ratios goes up over time. So over the long haul, over the life of the well, if you don't look -- as we look to a lot of the vertical wells, you see the gas rate it stayed relatively stable, but the overall gas oil ratio was increasing. I have to go back and kind of look to give a little bit more color on exactly what the decline rate is. But we're not -- I can tell you this, it's not falling out of the bottom very quickly. So it is declining as which you would normally expect it to do. And remember, since it is -- since you look at that time 0 graph, a lot of the production early on is going to be oil. So that gives you a fairly representative decline rate of what your oil is going to be. You're not going to see a significant change of gas oil ratio, that early over the first year. So if you honor the data that's in there and kind of use what the IP is, that kind of get you a relative sense of what we look like.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And a couple other comments. Obviously the economics that we have on our website include all of that and have factored all of that in there. Plus again, we're showing the 0 time plots for all the wells that we've had so far and what that historic data looks like.", "Anne Cameron - BNP Paribas, Research Division", "And similar question, different play. The 33 wells that you brought on in Southwest PA look like they are 14% condensate, which is a good bunch oilier than both your wet and your super-rich curve. So especially because that included the 5 dry wells, and because the NGL is kind of lower, could we see like a change in composition for both of those type curves?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Let's say one thing what you're seeing is we're shifting where we're drilling the wells. So as we continue to move -- and there's a map in there again on the website that shows different Btu lines and I think we denote 1,050, 1,350, but there is a gradation as go across there. And as oil prices are high and condensate prices are high and gas is low we've shifted a lot more of our drilling into the wetter areas. So yes. Therefore, that could happen with time and we'll keep you updated on -- what those results are.", "Operator", "We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Mike Scialla of Stifel Nicolaus for our final question.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Wanted to ask you a few things about your NGLs. You said you were close to an agreement on third outlet for ethane. Can you elaborate on that at all?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Obviously, we can't. As soon as we can, Mike, we will put that out.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I wish we could say more, but we can't.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I understand. Sounds like Enterprise is considering changing that ATEX line from ethane only to wide-grade. Would that cause you to change your plans if that were to happen?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "We've been focused on multiple outlets and multiple contracts, and again, we've got a great team up there led by Chad Stephens who is here in the room with us and his team, the guys who work for him does a great job. Craig Davis, Curt Tipton and company. So we continually look at those things. I think the good news is there's more and more options are developing in the basin. It's turning into like I said the largest gas field in the country and ultimately, when you consider the other horizons have the potential to be the largest gas field in the world. We've got a great position. More and more of those options are developing all of which ultimately enhance the value of our properties.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. Let me switch over to the Utica. You were kind of quiet about your Northwest Pennsylvania acreage for a while. Can you talk about maybe why that was and why now that you're confident that you're in the wet gas part of the play up there?", "Ray N. Walker", "That's a legacy asset that we've had for a long time, 25 plus years. And I think over 300,000 acres in the shallow rights. And we've had different teams, different divisions within the company look at it over time. And essentially through a group of events more or less. When we sold the Barnett, we took some of those really highly gifted technical folks that are working on the Barnett. And we said, \"Why don't you go look at the Utica up here underneath Northwest PA? We're bound to have some lease rights there? And lo and behold, they looked at it, saw a good potential. It was about the time the stuff in Ohio was looking pretty good. And we have 190,000 net acres. And so they've done a tremendous amount of really good technical work, putting together, lots of information. Some of that's in the presentation where we've shown type logs and we've shown that it's on strike. It's about the right depth. It's got a lot of the same characteristics of some of the successful wells over in the wet Utica in Ohio. So we think it's got a lot of potential. There's a lot of smart people that are in and around our position up there, leasing or drilling and testing some wells and doing some different things. And so we're kind of at the point now where we believe it's got great potential. It could be phenomenal. We're essentially at the point where we really just got to get some horizontal wells drilled and tested and see what we have there. The well that we're currently drilling right now is -- we're doing a lot of diagnostics on it. And we'll be completing that well here in a month or so once we get all that data in and look at it. And hopefully by the next conference call, we'll be able to talk about that and have some really great results. And assuming what we learned there and everything we learn over the next couple of months, we've got another well teed up to drill in October. So I think when we get to the end of the year, like I said in my remarks, we'll know a whole lot more about that play and what the potential is going forward. And we can kind of put it into the portfolio. We don't have any of that in any of our resource potential right now. So we're really excited about the upside potential that we see there. So...", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. In the last call you talked a lot about your RCS completion technique, the improvement you were seeing there in recoveries. Is that something that you are continuing to implement. Is it becoming the predominant completion technique in the Marcellus? And also have you tried it outside the Marcellus?", "Ray N. Walker", "We have tried it to a limited extent outside the Marcellus. We're looking at more stages along the lateral and literally all these plays that we're looking at. It's -- while we have done it a lot, I wouldn't quite classify it as the predominant completion method yet in -- at least in our Marcellus, we've certainly done more of them. We're certainly intrigued by the results. They're all looking really well. Unfortunately, we had a delay that we talked about earlier, in some of these wells coming on line. So I think over the next quarter -- 2 quarters, we'll really get to see a lot of those wells come online that we tried some of the RCS and some of the super-rich and the really wet Marcellus part of the acre -- wet part of the Marcellus acreage. And once those wells come online and we get a few months under our belt on production, then I think we'll be better equipped to answer that question. But right now we're encouraged very well by it. And it really -- if it works like it has shown us in the early wells, it's going to really improve our economics.", "Operator", "This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Range is on target to meet our production goals within our capital budget. We're driving down our unit cost in the process. Because we have very large acreage positions in some of the best plays in the country, we should be able to achieve double-digit growth in production and reserves on a per share basis net adjusted for many years. Plus we continue to be one of the lowest cost producers in our peer group and are getting better.", "In addition, the 5 enhancements to our portfolio, the super-rich Marcellus, the super-rich Upper Devonian, the wet Utica, the horizontal Mississippian play and the Cline oil shale play all offer significant upside to Range. Additional news on all of these plays will be coming on our third and fourth quarter calls. I'd like to point out that we still have 10 callers in the queue, and we're  not able to take questions in order to honor the time of the call, but I really encourage you to give us a call so that we can follow up on all those questions. And thanks to everybody for participating on the call.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Statements contained in this conference call that a not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] .", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney L. Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the third quarter with record production and a continuing decrease in unit costs. Both earnings and cash flow per share results were greater than first call consensus.", "But first, the order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After the speakers, we will conduct a question-and-answer period. Also Mr. Pinkerton, our Executive Chairman, is on the call today.", "Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC this morning that's now available on the homepage of our website or you can access it using SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we've posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today.  We've also added tables, which will guide you in the modeling of our future realized prices for natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. Detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter is also included on the website.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you, Rodney. The third quarter was another great quarter for Range. Production for the third quarter of 2012 was 790 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which was 47% higher than the third quarter of 2011 and 10% higher than the second quarter of 2012. We're on track to achieve 35% year-over-year growth for 2012 versus 2011 within our capital budget of $1.6 billion.", "On the cost side, absolute LOE dollars for the third quarter were below the prior year quarter, resulting in LOE per mcfe dropping from $0.58 per mcfe to $0.40 per mcfe. This is directly related to the quality of the wells that we're drilling and the quality of the teams operating the properties. All line unit costs continue to drop and are continuing the trend that we have in the first 2 quarters for 2012. Roger will discuss the cost management and results in more detail in a few minutes.", "We also achieved an important marketing milestone in the third quarter. Rain announced that we have become the anchor ship around the Mariner East NGL pipelines project. As the anchor shipper, we have firm transportation to ship 40,000 barrels per day of processed liquids from MarkWest Houston Pennsylvania plant to Sunoco's Markus Hook terminal facility near Philadelphia. The 40,000 barrels per day will consist of 20,000 barrels of ethane per day and 20,000 barrels of propane per day.", "Under the agreements, we also have access to a very significant portion of the 1 million barrels of propane storage at the facility. The propane can be delivered into the East Coast and Northeast U.S. markets and/or exported internationally, which opens up significant new markets for us.", "In addition to this agreement, we also announced the 15-year ethane sales agreement with Eneos. Eneos is a global manufacturer of specialty chemical and oil products and currently plans to utilize its own ship fleet to take delivery of our ethane at the Sunoco's Marcus Hook dock facilities.  Contracted volumes are planned to start in the first half of 2015 and increase over time to 20,000 barrels per day.", "The Mariner East project is the third ethane project in which we have announced our participation. The first ethane project was Mariner West. Mariner West is expected to start in midyear 2013 and ramp up to 15,000 barrels of ethane per day. The ethane will be purchased by Novo Chemical and transported to Sarnia, Canada. The second project that we announced was our participation in the ATEX project, which will move ethane to the Gulf Coast Petrochemical Complex. This project is planned to start in 2014 and ramp-up to 20,000 barrels per day. All 3 ethane projects originate at the MarkWest Houston plant in Washington County, Pennsylvania.", "In essence, these 3 projects ensure that will be able to meet gas pipeline specifications in a timely manner, they give us operational flexibility and they enable us to build and grow our wet Marcellus production volumes. These 3 projects, assuming minimum ethane extraction, allow us to potentially grow Marcellus volumes in the wet portion of the play up to 1.8 Bcf per day. In addition these 3 projects will add about $0.40 per mcf to our effective gas price.", "On Slide 10 of our current IR presentation on our website, it shows that we have about 335,000 net acres in the wet portion of the Marcellus, which is in the Southwest portion of the play. In addition, we have about 235,000 net acres of dry gas in the same area. Summing both areas, we have 570,000 net acres here. Since we discovered the play in October of 2004, approximately 1,500 wells have been drilled in this area. Based on those roughly 1,500 wells or so, our many long-distance step out and delineation wells, and considering that our discovery well came online in 2005 and that we now have up to 7 years our production history, we believe that all of this acreage is highly perspective for Marcellus Shale.  Combined, between the wet and dry portions of the play, we believe that we can possibly grow the Marcellus production alone to 2 to 3 Bcfe per day.", "In addition, we believe a lot of this acreage has perspective for both the Upper Devonian and Utica Shales and would allow us to leverage existing Marcellus infrastructure. With success in these other horizons, we have the possibility of growing beyond 3 Bcfe per day.", "It's important to note that it's not just growth. The growth in gas filled with the best large scale repeatable economics in the U.S., particularly given Range's dominant position in the wet portion of the play. The economics are very good given the capital required to drill and complete the wells versus the projected recoveries per well. The other key is the effective uplift in price due to the liquids production. If natural gas is priced at roughly $3, given all the uplifts from a natural gas liquids and condensates, the effective price we receive on the wet gas portion of the Marcellus is about $6 or about double gas price alone. That assumes the ethane stays in the gas. Once we begin to recover ethane, and once all 3 ethane and propane agreements are in effect based on current strip prices, it adds about $0.40 per mcf to the $6 price, which further enhances our economics.", "For 2012, we entered the year with a goal of growing between 30% to 35% with a $1.6 billion capital budget. I stated on a couple of previous calls this year that if we choose to live within projected cash flow for 2013, we could grow at 15% to 20%. This year, we drilled in the dry gas portions of the Marcellus Shale in the Northeast, which, for us, centers in and around Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. We did this in order to drill the hole that we believe are some of the most perspective acreage in this region. We ran 4 and, at times, up to 5 rigs in this area.", "By January 2013, we plan to be down to one drilling rig here. The reason is, at this point, we can run one rig and still hold the key acreage we want to keep in that area given the continuous drilling plazas that we have, coupled with larger tracks in general than in the Southwest part of the play.", "Therefore, given the relatively low price of dry gas as compared to wet gas and oil, for 2013, we're planning to focus on the wet and oil areas of our portfolio. Also, come January 2013, the 2 areas that we plan to focus on drilling to convert acreage that held by production are the wet portion of the Marcellus in the horizontal Mississippian oil play in Northern Oklahoma and Southern Kansas, which has a large liquid and oil component. The good news is that our 2 most economic plays happened to be where we need and want to drill to hold acreage.", "Given that we can reduce drilling in the northeast portion of the Marcellus from 4 to 5 rigs to 1 in 2013, we will most likely be reducing capital spending in 2013. I want to stress that we don't set our budget into our December board meeting, our budget is subject to board approval. In past years, after board approval, we typically announce our 2013 capital program at the end of January or early February.", "Given those caveats and realizing that it's still early, looking at strip pricing today, preliminarily, it looks like even with the reduction to a single rig in the Northeast dry Marcellus, we can still grow volumes for 2013 at a rate of 20% to 25% over 2012 focusing on the liquids-rich and oil areas. To do so, we currently estimate that we would overspend cash flow by approximately $250 million, plus or minus, assuming current strip pricing. Over the next month and a half, we'll prepare a recommended 2013 budget for our board and present it in our December board meeting.", "Looking at 2014 and beyond, we control and operate almost all of our assets, except for Nora field in Virginia. If strip prices hold for 2014 and beyond, we will look at ramping up our growth -- in ramping our growth back up. In essence, we'll move the growth lever up with higher prices, while being mindful of holding key Marcellus in Mississippian acreage and fulfilling our longer-term ethane and propane commitments.", "In the Mississippian play, given continued drilling success in our 150,000 net acre position we're planning on ramping up drilling. If we begin 2013 with 5 drilling rigs and move to 10 rigs in 2014 and 15 rigs in 2015, we believe we can hold all of our acreage within the primary term and significantly grow our oil, NGL and gas volumes in the play.", "As most of you probably recall, in the timeframe from 2004 to 2011, we sold about $1.8 billion of properties. These asset sales did several important things for us. They allowed us to keep focusing on growing our most economic projects, which had the highest growth rates with the lowest cost, while divesting of our low-growth high-cost projects. This focus not only our capital on our best projects, but it also enabled us to focus our technical talent on our best projects.", "In our release this week, we announced another $170 million of sales, most of which consist of our Ardmore Basin assets and some scattered Marcellus acreage. Completing this transaction, as we expect, will bring us a total of about $190 million in sales this year. We'll continue to identify assets that we think make sense to divest.", "In summary, we believe that we have the ability to create substantial shareholder value in the current commodity price environment and have the quality of assets and flexibility to do so for many years to come.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.", "Ray N. Walker", "Thanks, Jeff. We exceeded our production guidance coming in higher on gas and NGLs and right in the strike zone on oil. In fact, 47% organic production growth, when comparing to the prior year quarter, is the highest production growth in the company's history. Again, this is a great testament to our operating and technical teams.  They've reached record production levels while, at the same time, substantially reducing expenses and improving efficiencies.", "To illustrate that point, let's talk about operating cost. In addition to our record production, we continue to see an impressive decrease in field level expenses. As I've pointed out in the past, we've seen really great improvements and efficiencies all across the board. And we still see those happening, and we believe that they will continue to happen as we're going forward. But when you combine the increased efficiencies with what our operating teams have achieved in lowering the finding and operating cost, it's truly impressive.", "For example, when comparing the third quarter of this year with the same quarter last year, we've seen a 47% increase in production, with a 31% decrease in LOE per mcfes. In fact, our absolute field level expenses have decreased, year-to-date, this year as compared to the same timeframe last year by 12%. Accomplishments like this really help us to achieve great economics, long-term, in what we believe to be some of the best and largest repeatable plays out there. Not only are we seeing great growth at low cost, we are also seeing improving well results.", "Now, let me highlight some of those results that we're seeing across the company. Please refer to our press release for specific well results. I'm not going to repeat all of those results in my remarks here, but they are certainly noteworthy, and we can discuss them during the Q&A. However, I do want to call your attention to the table in the Southern Marcellus section of the press release. It shows 64 wells coming online during the third quarter in the super-rich and wet Marcellus areas.", "If you compare those rates to the type curves in our current IR presentation, you'll notice that the average RPs of those 64 wells is above the type curves and, in particular, the liquids rates are well above the type curves. In the super-rich area, we had a significant step-out well that tested at 1,044 barrels of liquids per day and 10.3 million gas, excluding ethane. If you figure in ethane, the well was 2,053 barrels of liquids per day with 8.7 million gas. The lateral length is approximately  3,800 feet, and it was completed using a 20-stage RCS completion. As you can imagine, the economics on a well like this would be phenomenal.", "What I want to stress here is that this well is one more example of how our wet and super-rich acreage is not only being derisked as we step out across the acreage, but it also illustrates the exceptional resource base that we put together over the last several years. As we're working on designs and stepping out across this position, we're continuing to see improving results as this position is derisked. We expect that our 335,000 net acres in the wet and super-rich Marcellus will provide for a highly profitable drilling program for many years to come.", "In addition, in our Northern Marcellus division, we continue to see outstanding results with good economics. But as Jeff said, we'll be ramping down our activity to enter 2013 with one rig as we continue to focus the majority of our capital towards liquids-rich and oil projects. Next year, we expect of able to meet our lease commitments on our key acreage in Northeast PA with generally one rig as now most of that acreage is HPP'd or in a continuous drilling mode.", "Also of importance, I want to give a quick update on the Upper Devonian shale. Our second super-rich Upper Devonian well continued to clean up following our early August announcement. It ultimately had a peak 24-hour rate of 552 barrels of liquids per day, of which 31% was condensate and 4.7 million a day of gas. With ethane extraction the well would be 998 barrels of liquids per day and 4 million gas. We don't plan any further Upper Devonian tests this year, and we're currently developing our plans for 2013.", "Shifting to the Utica, our first wet Utica well in Northwest PA was drilled and completed successfully. The log data and core data that we collected, along with the pressure testing we performed, show us to be right in the strike zone for liquids-rich production. The well is currently set in for a 60- to 90-day period post frac and we'll be keeping any results proprietary for a while longer. With the data we've gathered, we now believe the Utica, in this area, could potentially benefit from the so-called aging or seasoning process that you may have heard others talk about. And that's why we have the wells set in. Of course, we'll have our own conclusions as to the technical and economic viability of this technique after we finish some of this testing. We are encouraged by what we see, and we still plan to spud the second wet Utica horizontal well late in the quarter. As it's still real early in this play, we expect to know a lot more about the potential of the wet Utica on our 190,000 net acres in Northwest PA by our next conference call.", "Now, let me shift to Oklahoma. The horizontal Mississippian oil play is progressing well. We're up to 156,000 net acres and now have our second well that exceeded 1,000 boe per day. We had a peak 24-hour rate of 1,227 boe per day. The lateral link that's approximately 4,000 feet, and it was completed with a 20-stage frac. We own a 74.9% working interest in that well. I think it's also important to point out that our first 1,000-plus boe per day well that we previously announced was turned to sales in the second quarter and has held up very well. The well has now achieved a 90-day average of 1,049 boe per day. Let me also point out that when we look at the IPs of the wells turned on in the last 2 quarters, the average IP is 552 boe per day, which is well above our 600 Mboe type curve. The team is continuing to optimize midstream and power infrastructure and is steadily improving our completion designs.  While it's early in the play, we believe our team can continue to produce these wells at very attractive operating costs that will continue to enhance our economics.", "In West Texas, at our Conger field properties, we've drilled our third Wolfberry vertical well. That well had an initial 24-hour production rate of 505 boe per day. This is substantially better than our first 2 Wolfberry wells. Those first 2 wells were projected to recover 216 Mboe each, and we expect this well will do better. It's also significant to point out that it was completed at 11% lower cost than the first 2 wells, and when you combine that with the better expected recovery, the economics will improve substantially.  Plans are to drill and complete 3 additional vertical Wolfberry wells at Conger in the fourth quarter.", "Shifting to the horizontal Cline oil play, there's still a lot of offset activity in the area, and we are monitoring that closely. We successfully drilled and completed our third horizontal Cline oil well and is currently being tested. It's still early in the cleanup process, and we expect to have test results to discuss at our next conference call.", "I also want to give a big attaboy to our marketing department. As the Marcellus and the Utica have grown, our team has taken many important and strategic steps in the Northeast markets. These steps ensure that our production flows steadily on a year-round basis for many years to come. Certainly, the ethane and propane deals are great examples of just a few of those strategic moves. Our team is always evaluating future opportunities and is consistently adjusting our portfolio, working with both pipelines and customers. Again, our marketing folks have done a great job staying right out in front in of the ever evolving Northeast markets.", "Our already strong safety record continues to improve as we remain well below our peer group averages. Our incident rate is 53% below our peer group's rate and 39% below our own incident rate in 2011. And our lost time rate is 54% below our peer group's rate and 64% below our 2011 rate. Safety and environmental protections remain a core value at Range. And from the bottom up, our operating teams believe it, live it and own it.", "As for guidance, like Jeff said, while our drilling and completion activity level will slow down a bit during the fourth quarter, which is primarily in Northeast PA and in spite of the Ardmore Woodford Shale, we still expect to come in right at a 35% year-over-year production growth target, with our fourth quarter liquids growth in the range of 33% to 36% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.", "As you can tell, we are really proud of our operating and technical teams. They make it really easy to talk about our results each quarter. In summary, cost and well performance are steadily improving, while working safely and protecting the environment. And we have some great way to return projects that are continuing to get better and better.", "Now, over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny", "Thanks, Ray. The third quarter extended our favorable growth and cost trends evidenced in the first 2 quarters of 2012. Fueled by strong production growth at low-cost, cash flow and EBITDAX both registered quarter-to-quarter increases.", "Turning first to the income statement, third quarter cash direct operating cost, including workovers, was $0.40 per mcfe, $0.18 below last year and equal to the second quarter. Year-to-date cash direct operating expense on an absolute dollar basis was $11.4 million lower than last year on 36% higher production volume. It would be impossible for every increase in production, while at the same time reducing cost, so we expect cash direct operating unit costs to be in the $0.43 to $0.45 range in the fourth quarter as we further increase our oil and liquids-rich production, which carry higher margins but also higher unit operating cost.", "Cash G&A expense for the third quarter was $0.46 per Mcfe, $0.07 below the third quarter of last year and $0.01 lower than the second quarter of this year. Salaries and benefits make up the largest component of our G&A expense, and we've seen these costs decline on a unit cost basis for the past 6 consecutive quarters. This is a key indicator of the quality and maturation of our play expansions as we are now increasing production consistently faster than our overhead.  Fourth quarter G&A unit cost is expected to be $0.44 to $0.46 per Mcfe.", "Third-party transportation, gathering and compression expense in the third quarter came in at $0.71 per Mcfe, $0.03 higher than last year. The timing of additional firm transportation capacity and the capital spent to hook up incremental production, do not always coincide with the timing of production commencement, which makes this expense somewhat variable. We anticipate this expense to be $0.75 to $0.79 per Mcfe in the fourth quarter.", "The third quarter DD&A rate was $1.69 per Mcfe, $0.20 per Mcfe lower than last year. Fourth quarter DD&A rate should be in the $1.65 to $1.68 per Mcfe range. And we believe that the DD&A rate will continue to decline as our capital efficiency further improves. The fourth quarter DD&A rate should reflect this as it will incorporate our year-end reserve report results.", "Recalling that most state production taxes are assessed on wellhead prices rather than effective prices after hedging, third quarter production taxes were $0.05 per Mcfe plus the Pennsylvania impact fee of $5.4 million. That brings the total production tax burden for the quarter to $0.12 per Mcfe. Prices have improved a bit recently, making our best estimate for fourth quarter production taxes $0.08 per Mcfe on total company production, plus $5 million for the Pennsylvania impact fee, making the total $0.15 per Mcfe.", "Interest expense for the third quarter were $0.61 per Mcfe, $0.08 below last year's figure. Higher production volume and incremental debt funded under the lower floating-rate bank revolver is what helped bring the unit interest cost down. The fourth quarter should see this trend continue, with interest expense of $0.59 to $0.60 per Mcfe.", "Exploration expense in the third quarter, excluding noncash compensation was $14 million, that's $3 million below last year due to lower dry hole and lower seismic expenditures. Seismic expenditures in the third quarter were only 1/3 of the budgeted amount due to project timing. So we expect to catch up in the fourth quarter, with total exploration expense of approximately $19 million.", "Our ordinary unproved property impairment for the third quarter was $20 million, and we also recognized an unusual impairment on an unproved property of $20 million, bringing the total unproved property impairment for the quarter to $40 million. The unusual item consisted of our last undeveloped Barnett Shale lease, which was held out on the 2011 sale. The fourth quarter estimate for unproved impairment is $19 million to $21 million.", "Third quarter cash flow was $189 million, essentially the same as the third quarter of last year, while EBITDAX for the quarter was $230 million, 4% higher than the third quarter of last year.  On a per fully diluted share basis, cash flow was $1.18 per share, $0.03 above analyst consensus estimates. Cash margin for the third quarter was $2.56 per Mcfe and earnings calculated using analyst methodology were $32 million or $0.20 per share, also $0.03 above analyst consensus estimate.", "As Rodney mentioned, please see our website for detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP figures to GAAP, along with hedging schedules and other helpful information for investors.", "Over on the balance sheet, things are pretty much business as usual in the third quarter. We funded our capital program with cash flow and draws under our $1.75 billion bank credit facility. The bank credit facility has a $2 billion borrowing base, which was unanimously reaffirmed by the 28-member Range bank group earlier this month and it's currently approximately 25% drawn. Though our rate of spending slowed considerably in the third quarter this year compared to the second quarter, our leverage, as measured by current total debt to trailing 4 quarter EBITDAX, increased slightly to 3.3x. We remain comfortable with our leverage around the 3x EBITDAX level, thanks to our high rate of return plays, low cost structure, long reserve life, operating control of our growth assets, substantial liquidity and our hedge position. EBITDAX is beginning to grow again, thanks to higher production and slightly higher prices, which should give us a bit of a tailwind on the leverage ratio going forward into 2013. Our increase in EBITDAX in 2013 will enable us to outspend cash flow by approximately $250 million, while also reducing the leverage ratio to below 3x.", "As has been our practice, as Jeff mentioned, we continually evaluate our assets for potential sale and will likely entertain additional sales periodically to sharpen our operating focus, which will also help keep leverage in check. As Jeff also mentioned, we have signed a purchase and sale agreement to sell our Ardmore Basin Woodford shale properties at a gain, which when closed, along with several small miscellaneous assets, will garner approximately $170 million in proceeds to shave the peak off of our leverage and help keep leverage from going any higher in the fourth quarter.", "We're pleased to have increased our hedge position during the third quarter. We added new hedges in 2012, 2013 and 2014. For the fourth quarter this year, we've got approximately 85% of our projected gas production hedged at a floor price of $4.17 MMBtu. We've got approximately 60% of our NGLs hedged at above market prices and approximately 80% of our projected oil production hedged at $90.82 a barrel.", "Our 2013 and 2014 natural gas and liquids hedge positions were increased during the third quarter such that we will again be entering the new year with approximately 3/4 of our 2013 production hedged and over half of our 2014 production hedged. Please reference the updated hedging schedules on the Range website for these new and existing hedge volumes and prices.", "To summarize, the third quarter showed continued cost reductions, which, when combined with record increases in production volume, increased our quarterly earnings and cash flow, positioning us very well for the fourth quarter.", "Jeff, back to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Real quickly with your comments about outspending for next year and tying that to discretionary cash flow, obviously, that discretionary cash flow is going to move with commodity prices, but you must have some sort of range in mind currently. Any chance you can share that with us?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. Well, let me start and then I'm sure Roger can pile on. But what we're talking about for next year and it's preliminary and subject to board approval, but what it looks like right now is we would get year-over-year growth of 20% to 25% outspending cash flow, looking at current strip prices by approximately $250 million, plus or minus. And then the other important part is looking at the strip in 2014 and beyond. In essence, we would look at ramping growth back up. And let me talk about it philosophically before I turn it over to Roger. Our strategy, and we've talked about it before, is on the low end. Within cash flow, we can grow at 15% to 20%. Of course, on the high end, it depends where you focus, whether you're focusing oil, liquids-rich or gas. But this year, obviously, we're growing at 35%. And now we have a huge inventory and a lot of flexibility, both in oil, wet and dry. And then we operate and control almost all of it. So as prices move up or as the strip looks better, we'll look at ramping up and as prices are worked, then growth rate will be a little lower. Then there's several key things in there. When we look at growth, for instance, for 2013 we're not focused on absolute growth. We're focused on best economics and best returns. So our drilling, therefore, next year, like I said, is we're going to cut down in the dry gas areas in Northeast Pennsylvania and focus our drilling on the liquids-rich and oil areas. Liquids-rich down in the Southwest part of the Marcellus and oil in the horizontal Mississippian. And so we're looking at cash flow per share rate of return, that type of stuff. If we are looking at just best absolute growth, obviously, what we'll do is drill 100% dry gas and for $250 million of our cash flow, we'll probably drill it at 35% to 40% or more. So and the other thing I think is important, we think in a dry gas area, it's just looking out. We ran some economics earlier this summer. If we delay drilling in, say, Lycoming County for a year or 2, in essence it doubles the rates of return if you move on a per well basis, if you move the capital out to the point in time when the strip's better. For 2014 and beyond, again, I just wanted to give you a little context before Roger comments more on the financial part. But in the Mississippian, we talked about ramping beginning of this year, 5 rigs, and then we'll success to 10 and 15. So, it sort of gives you a feel for the shape of the curve there and the growth in the Mississippian. In the wet Marcellus, you can look at those ethane agreements as a proxy for what our gas rate's going to be in the wet areas. When you add the 3 together, we have committed a 55,000 barrels of ethane per day. So currently we're 0 selling ethane. So by mid-to-late 2016, we need to be at 55,000 barrels of ethane per day to fulfill those agreements. Under minimum extraction, that's 1.8 Bcf per day. Under most likely extraction that's 800 million. To put that in context, currently in the wet area, we're about 370 million per day. So on the minimum, on the low end, we're going to more than double production in the wet Marcellus to fill those agreements by mid-to-late 2016. So when I sort of put it all in context and I think probably the most important thing to do that is what our portfolio and we talk about 44 to 60 Tcf. But I want to stress a lot of that's in the Marcellus and down in the Southwest. Highly derisked because there's 1,500 wells and it's not just 1,500 wells, but when you go on our IR presentation, you can look at the quality of the wells in the wet, the super-rich and in the dry. There's a big data set with up to 7 years worth of history, and that's where our acreage is. So not only can we grow at 20% to 25% and then ramp up in subsequent years to potentially something higher, we can do that for many years to come, for probably a decade or more to come. So I think that -- I'm not saying we're unique, but because we discovered and have a big position and what we think it's one of the best, the largest gas field now in the U.S. and particularly in the wet area where the best economics are, we're very well-positioned to do that for a long time to come. So let me flip it back to Roger to talk more about the funding and leverage.", "Roger S. Manny", "Yes, just commenting on the overspend, Dave, we're obviously in a capital-intensive, highly-cyclical business and we mind our balance sheet very closely and our balance sheet is in great shape and we want to keep it that way. We've got a lot of financial flexibility and liquidity built into the balance sheet. So the question is how comfortable are we leaning on the debt throttle in times like 2012 and in times like 2013. And the reason we're comfortable at this point talking about overspending cash flow, $250 million, plus or minus, as Jeff says, is that with the trailing -- current debt to trailing 4 quarter EBITDAX measure, which we feel is the best measure of leverage, given a tailwind from higher EBITDAX from higher prices and higher production, let's just go into 2013 to where you can overspend cash flow by about a quarter billion and still actually drive that leverage ratio down a few ticks. So that's really the plan behind that. We have, as I mentioned, plenty of liquidity. The question is how we use that liquidity and we intend to be prudent about how we go about doing that.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Appreciate that, and maybe just to clarify a little bit, you must have kind of a range around that discretionary cash flow, and I'm imagining that, that organic discretionary cash flow, not necessarily cash inflows, i.e. asset sales, and just roughly looking at kind of our model that would put you in a range of maybe call it $850 million to $950 million for next year. Am I way off the mark, I'm just trying to triangulate to what that CapEx, aggregate CapEx number would be.", "Roger S. Manny", "We've never given cash flow guidance. And I certainly don't want to start now. What I can comment -- and I'm also not going to second-guess the board on the CapEx budget for next year. So I really can't comment on your range. But I can assure you that we've run the numbers, and we feel confident in the 20%, 25% range and the 250 approximate overspend.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Carver with Capital One Southcoast.", "Marshall H. Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division", "On the 2013 growth, thanks for the color there, with the emphasis on liquids in both the Mississippian and Southwest PA, is it safe to assume that the liquids growth would probably be a little bit higher than 20% to 25% and the gas growth would be lower?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "We're not going to come out with the specifics again until we present to the board and get it approved. But in generally speaking, yes, the liquids grow disproportionately to the gas and to the overall. But we'll come out with all those specific numbers once we get formal approval from our board, December. Typically, we get approval and so roughly around the first week of December, and it's been like end of January and early February when we do it. Maybe we'll accelerate that, we can bat that around, maybe we'll do it in mid-December or something or January. But, yes, the overall answer to your question is, yes. They will grow disproportionately.", "Marshall H. Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division", "And just sort of follow-on to that, then I'll hop out of queue, are there any bottlenecks or the liquids end in next year? Or how should we think about that?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, I think what we're seeing in the fourth quarter is due to some of the timing issues that we talked about a couple of quarters back. A lot of these wells are getting compressed into the third and fourth quarter. So we're seeing a lot of wells come online, and that's just kind of exaggerating the bottlenecks that are there. And I think that we're seeing that unwind, and we really expect that to unwind even further into 2013. We turned on 84 wells in the third quarter, which is a bunch of wells. And as we see that backlog unwind, which we're beginning to see the effects of that, I really believe in 2013, most of that will have worked its way out as, especially as we get into the second quarter or so of next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the 2013 preliminary numbers, specifically on the outspend, it sounds like you guys are comfortable with just using the leverage to grow. Or are you guys going to plan to plug that $250 million gap via additional asset sales? And if so, what's kind of next step on the list in terms of what you would consider selling?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, let me talk about it in general terms. If you look at the period from 2004 through 2011, we sold $1.8 billion worth of properties. And through that time, we significantly drove up production and drove up our share price. This year, so far, because we sold a little bit in the beginning of the year, to date, we've sold $190 million worth of properties. So Roger and his team and working together with the board will come up with a way we can optimally finance that as we look forward. Clearly, we have the ability, if we choose to do so, to carve off a little more assets like we have historically. But Roger will be making that recommendation as we go forward. Our strategy has been, we think periodically selling things makes a lot of sense for a number of reasons. One, it really keeps us focused operationally. It keeps us directing our capital into our highest return, best growth, large scale repeatable projects, and by the same time selling them, it prevents us from investing like when we had the offshore, I guarantee you, whenever you're in an area you get AFE'd by a partner, you have to react to something. The only way that you get out and spending money in areas that you prefer not to spend a lot of times, it is just to sell it. Plus, it enables you to redirect your people. So, I think we have a very focused company, and we've shown the ability this year, even with the sales that we have, we're still hitting our growth targets even when we sold the Barnett, literally, selling 120 million a day within 6 months we have such robust, large-scale projects now. We more than made it up within a short period of time, with much higher rates of return. So that's what we've done historically and as we finalize our budget and look into next year, we'll come out with what that plan is.", "Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and in that vein, for the Permian, how much more do you guys need to see from a delineation standpoint to sort of bucket that area in terms of being one of those core assets versus being something that you would consider monetizing?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I think the key part with the Permian, it's sort of like our Utica play as well. All of that Permian acreage is held by production, which really gives you great flexibility. It gives us time to watch our wells, to watch our competitors' wells. Same with Utica there, we have another 190,000 net acres that's all held by production. And again going back to a higher level theme of Range, we like to get into areas where there's high quality, large-scale repeatable stack pays, rich hydrocarbon charge and then put a really strong technical team on there and continuing to work and work and work and coming up with those new opportunities. And that's really paid a lot of dividends for the company. So we don't have a time frame per se, but we continually look at the results of our wells and others, and that will determine what's optimum for the company. Like I said, as evidenced, we're not -- we're all about -- we're aligning with the shareholders. It's all about share price performance, growing production per share, reserves per share, debt adjusted. So whatever makes the most sense to do, we'll do. We sold $1.8 billion worth of properties. So if that's the right thing to do, we'll do it. We're really focused on the best returns and the best opportunities as we go forward. And as we learn more about those areas, then they need to go higher into the list or lower, based on performance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Did you guys -- I'm not sure who alluded this, but could you just talk about all the infrastructure coming online in the Marcellus and how much more capacity that frees up for you, when, and as you think about the timeframe over the next few quarters that, that comes on, when do you anticipate most of that additional infrastructure to be in place and what's the timeframe look like for the next couple of quarters?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, David, this is Ray. The infrastructure bottlenecks, per se, that we experienced this year were really midstream, had to do with low-pressure gathering and compression and so forth. And like we've said earlier, MarkWest is kind of a [indiscernible] job by catching up and actually getting ahead of us now and now we're beginning to get those wells put online. And so we kind of -- as far as the infrastructure needs, going into 2013, the amount of pipe, for instance, that they have to put in place in 2013 is a whole lot less than it was this year. So we're kind of, for lack of being cheesy about it, we kind of have reached an inflection point in the infrastructure. And the fact that the biggest part of it's been built, and now we're going to go -- basically, now, we're just kind of tying in wells to already major infrastructure that's there. So in Southwest PA, we really don't see any big issues. Of course, we're still going to be ordering plants going into the future in different things like that. But that's all way out in front of where we're at, and we feel really, really good about that. Like Jeff talked about in his remarks, we've got a definite plan to be getting to the point where we can deliver on all these commitments that we've got and do it in an economic and reasonable manner to get there. So we feel pretty good about infrastructure going forward, and we don't foresee any huge bottlenecks, especially in Southwest PA or really in Northeast PA where PVRs just put phase 3 online up there. So we're really good shape for the next couple of years on infrastructure.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And I'd just add, back to the ethane agreements and as we continue to ramp up in ethane, in essence we're taking the ethane out of the gas and selling it as a liquid, which frees up about 100 million a day in the gas pipeline. So there's another benefit that comes out of those projects.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, let me ask an unrelated follow-up. Equitable's, if you're talking about selling assets and here on presumably on the potential board for being sold, would you guys sell that generally with Equitable? How would that process work?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, I'm not -- you have to ask Equitable what they\u2019re doing, which I'm sure you've done. But EQT, to make it modern-day, yes, we are partners with them. They have the Huron in Kentucky; and then on the Virginia side, we're partners with them in Nora; and then separately, we have other assets, friends [ph] since we own Haysi 100% and Big Rock 100% and that type of thing, Widen 100%. But we like those assets in Virginia. We always want to be -- do whatever the right thing is for the shareholders, but we really like the assets we have in the Virginia. It has that same characteristic that we like to see at Range. Their stack pays. Everything from literally from a lot of thousand feet down, you have the CBM, you have the CBM, then you have the traditional zones in the Berea and Big Lime, then you have the Huron Shale. All of it is either held by production or we own the minerals. Actually, our economics are superior to what EQT has, because we own the royalty. We actually get paid the royalty on those pieces. Our team, even though we've cut the capital way back there, because we can, and we have that in idle, they're still growing production this year, even with a $13 million budget, which is just a minor fraction. So we have really high-quality asset with a high-quality team. But we do have other scattered assets throughout the company, if we want to sell things, that we control and we operate, and we -- like I said, as evidenced by the past 7, 8 years now, periodically, we're always looking at it, and we've ranked those assets out and there's things that fall to the bottom and we would consider selling those if it's the right time in the right place in the right area. Don't get lost a little bit in our flipbook and if you look at the IR presentation. We're focusing on the things we're spending money on, but we have a lot of production in other areas, we just don't list it all. And for those of you who have been with us for a while, we used to have the pyramid that Rodney loved. So, the pyramid and all those other things that would be possible considerations for asset sales.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just 2 questions here. First on that great result you had on that step out on that super-rich area, I was wondering are you planning, I guess, to drill a number around that? Is that why kind of the delay to bring that online and by the result you're seeing there, have you already essentially delineated and sort of connected the dots in that area if you know where I'm going with that?", "Ray N. Walker", "We are -- it was a significant step out. And by definition, we didn't have infrastructure out there where that well is. So it's going to be a while before it comes online. And to answer your question, yes, I mean now that we have derisked that step out area, we'll begin marching towards it with infrastructure and with wells as we go forward. That way, you kind of know there's a great target out there and, again, that's been real surprising to me, especially since I was there essentially from the beginning that as we stepped out and continue to step out, we're just seeing better and better and better results. So the size and scale of this play is really truly amazing. It just keeps getting better.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, it's really exciting like what Ray said in that area as we stepped out in the super-rich, we have 125,000 acres out there, really big blocky position. So it's a great opportunity and even though we've been drilling out there for years now, I would argue -- and Bill Zagorski, our geologist, has said, we probably haven't drilled our best wells yet. So the future is really bright.", "Ray N. Walker", "And there's significantly higher rate of returns. I mean if you look at our updated PowerPoint slides on the website, you can see that in that area, just because prices have come up a little lightly and we're making better wells too, but I mean those wells are over 90% rate of return now.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Yes, that's very noticeable. Good -- great point, guys. And just a follow-up, on the Utica, I noticed you need to have in that first one, shut-in, and talking about drilling as second. Here in the fourth quarter, again, I know you haven't said too much yet on that, Jeff, either for you or for Ray. Just wondering the expectations on liquids expectations and then thoughts on once you'll see these 2, will this dictate, I know you've kind of talked about your budget next year with this depending how good or how liquid these wells are, would this could dictate some of your spending next year in that area?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, I'll start. I'm sure Jeff will jump in afterwards. The Utica well, we've done -- being the first well for us, we did not have to bear a lot of the cost of the learning curve that we did in the Marcellus. So we kind of setback on purposes, an HBP position. It's been there for years. And so we've kind of tried to learn from everybody else. But we began gathering data and then on this well what we've done is the actual data from this well, and I mean logs, cores, pressure data, everything that we've done to date puts us right on strike with some of the good stuff that's happening down in Carolyn and Harrison County that we're reading about. And we've been working a lot with offset operators and talking about that and exchanging data. So we've learned a whole lot. Everything we've seen today, we were very encouraged with, and so currently we've got the wells shut-in, doing the aging or seasoning or shake and bake or whatever you want to call it. And we do believe that there's some technical reasons that, that could help the well and could work on it. So we're just trying to gather all this information, get our test results, everything we see tells us we still should go ahead and drill the second well. As far as next year, it's way too early to tell. I mean I'm going to make the case until we get the results from these first 2 wells in some of the offset activity, we probably won't plan anything. Again, it's an HBP position, so we don't have to do anything next year. And I'd rather put our money in some known projects down in the super-rich, for instance, and make 100% rate of return wells if I could do that.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Ray, are you talking Utica or the Point Pleasant?", "Ray N. Walker", "It's the point Pleasant. In most cases, it's the Point Pleasant that's what's producing this, not really the Utica. Although, we all call it that.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And I'd just add a little bit, like Ray said, we're confident that we're in the liquids part of it, got all the right ingredients, we'll see when we test it. And Ray's point is really a key one. It's all held by production, just like all that stuff out in the Permian, where we're testing different things too. In the Marcellus, when we started, since it was a Range idea, when we were the first company out there, we had to carry 100% of the cost of the R&D. We don't have to do that for the Utica or for the Cline some of these other plays because they're HBP positions. I've noticed recently Floyd Wilson's company, Halc\u00f3n, spotted a lot of wells just in and around it. So up there, they have a big position. You have [indiscernible] company has that and others. And we're right on strike with the good stuff and a lot of other people are -- you are going to start to see a lot of wells popping up in and around it. So, we'll do -- we'll carry some of the R&D and let others carry some of that as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just kind of a follow-up on 2013. You talked about ramping down the pure gas activity in Northeast Pennsylvania Marcellus and ramping up Mississippian by a fair bit. You said you will start the year with 5 rigs, just -- and then go to 10 in '14. Would you expect to kind of ramp up the rig count in '13 in the Mississippian kind of literally over the next couple of years to get to 10 rigs in '14 and then to 15 rigs in 2015? And would also expect any potential reductions in the wet Marcellus in 2013 as part of your plan to lower CapEx?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "We'll reverse it, I'll start this time and Ray can go add on. When you look at the Mississippian, what we're thinking about right now, it's a little more stair stepped. We'll probably have 5 rigs starting the year probably in January of '13 going to 10 rigs in January of '14 and 15 rigs in the following year. And then obviously, as we learn to become more efficient, we'll tweak in all that, but that's trajectory. We really significantly drive up oil volumes, liquids volumes and gas volumes up there by doing that and hold all the acreage within the primary terms. So we think that we've got a really strong team up there, really good plan. In the wet and super-rich part of the Marcellus, as I said, we're looking at -- an easy way to think about it, and we'll get more clarity with time, but if you just look at that 3 ethane deals we committed to, we have to be by 55,000 barrels per day by mid- to late 2016, which dictates, if you back calculate it the other way, under most likely ethane extraction, it's 800 million a day. Under a minimum, it's 1.8 Bcf per day. We're currently at 3.70 Bcf. So it sort of gives you a feel, high and low, what the trajectory is just in the wet and super-rich part. Obviously, Ray is working with the teams there and the guys that we have on the ground. They're going to do that as efficiently as they can with the fewest number of rigs and lease capital to get the highest returns. So there's my -- I'm tossing the baton back to Ray.", "Ray N. Walker", "Thanks, Jeff. It's really -- there's no -- it's really hard to think about slowing down in the southern Marcellus because we're really not slowing down in 2013. We're really continuing to grow pretty substantially.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "We're slowing down the dry part in the Northeast, and we're keeping the southern Appalachia down in Nora idled. But, I think, as the gas prices pick up, those areas will kick in and really supercharge the growth. And at that time, we'll have better returns. So, I've seen a rupture from that. [indiscernible] I've never done that before.", "Ray N. Walker", "And the drilling rigs, again, this is sort of one of my pet peeves. It's hard to think about rig count anymore as describing activity because these rigs are getting so fast, and so efficient that, I mean, we're literally doing twice the work with the drilling rig today than we did a year ago. So it's really more about in these kind of plays is what all of the industry is learning. It's more about infrastructure and pads and timing and bringing those pads online and all that sort of things. So what we're seeing next year is longer laterals, more frac stages. We're getting better and more efficient designs. We're having to build less infrastructure. So, we really are, activity-level wise, probably still going. We may be growing slower than we were, but we are still growing next year. We're not slowing down by any means.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And growing at a significant level.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, very significant.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful there on the clarity. Question on the cost side, I've just been noticing that your transport cost has kind of been going up on $1 per Mcfe basis, really, ever since you guys kind of established that metric, I think it was in the fourth quarter of '11. You guys are expected to go up again this quarter. Do you just have any kind of longer-term color on when that may start to flatten out? Should we see that flat in '13 at $0.75 to $0.79 per mcf? Is that going to keep climbing? Just any thoughts you have around that would be helpful.", "Roger S. Manny", "This is Roger. As I mentioned on the note, it's truly a variable cost. There's a lot going on under the hood with that metric. You've got money being spent, you've got production volumes varying in different areas of the company. So you got a lot of moving parts that come up with that. The uptick in fourth quarter, we've got some capacity on the team project that's coming on the fourth quarter. So the bills are going to start coming in for that capacity. So creates a little lump there. And the production will start to catch up and maybe you're putting out a plant somewhere. So it's just kind of a constant tug of war between volume and capital spend. So we'll continue try to guide you guys as best we can, but as I mentioned in the notes, the timing doesn't always kind of work out the way your spreadsheet says it's going to. But you'll probably see that continue to trend upwards for a piece and then eventually the volume will build, and it'll trend back down.", "Ray N. Walker", "Especially, on the gathering side, Leo, and then on your transportation side, as we can transport this gas to newer markets that have a higher positive basis in the market to sell the gas at, that sales price is going to go up in gas sales. It's not going to come reducing to your transportation cost. So you're going to have to be cognizant of the expansion of the market and our margin versus just the absolute cost. So there'll be different arrangements that come that direction, but Roger is exactly right, is the gathering charges, you got to build it before you put the gas in it. There is our charging for you as soon as that comes on, but then as the volumes come on, it's going to ramp that per Mcfe down on the gathering. And we've discussed, internally, as to whether or not we actually break that line out into 2 components when it gets to some significant size. So as you can see, the gathering, ebbing and flowing, as you turn on things and then your transportation charge basically will translate back to your commitments footnote as to what you've got for firm takeaway capacity to be able to always deliver your gas to the markets and keep the gas to flow.", "Operator", "We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Joe Magner of the Macquarie group for our final question.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "Just curious where the Permian fits in your plans for 2013 looks like you having good success down there I know a lot of it is HBP, but just curious how you're thinking about that.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes. I mean, right now we're not what I would call super active out there. It's a big HBP position, and we're drilling a few Wolfberry vertical wells. Those are, as we talked about earlier, they're improving dramatically just in the first 3 wells, and so we've got to see more wells we will do this quarter. We're still putting plans together to see what we do next year. Again, the important thing about that position is it's HBP. We don't have to do anything next year. So I'm guessing, at this point that we will have some minimal amount of activity there next year to kind of help prove up some things or more or less confirm some things that we learn from activity in the area. But no real big plans at all at this point.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "Okay, and then touched on a little bit, here, a second ago, just on improving rig efficiencies. Is there a way to quantify or perhaps provide us with an update on how many wells you think you can drill per rig per year in both the Southwest Marcellus as well as the horizontal Miss?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well that's a great question, Joe, and unfortunately, there's not a real good black and white answer to it, because we're still finalizing plans on lateral length and completion styles and number of wells per pad and all of those different things. We're also looking at some better designed rigs as we've gotten smarter and gotten more wells under our belt and different things that we're considering. So it's hard to give you an answer, but you can go back and look at the -- I think it was in the last quarter where I spent a lot of time talking about the efficiencies that we saw year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And we're still seeing those kind of results. I can't quote you numbers today, but I'm sure we could get the IR guys to follow up with you on some numbers. But it's too early to talk about 2014 just because it's -- I mean, 2013 or '14, because we're still putting those plans together and finalizing kind of tweaking what the actual numbers will be.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Still need to present it to the board, still need to get approval, all those kinds of things.", "Ray N. Walker", "Right.", "Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research", "And just one last one, Jeff, you touched on gas prices, as gas prices pick up, perhaps ramping up some activity. What price level would you need to see on a sustainable basis for you to start thinking about dry gas activity again?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well I think what's really key is if you look on our website for the dry gas areas, we have economics out there, and you can see them for both Southwest PA and in the Northeast. And -- I'll see if I can flip through it. I'll make my point and make sure I get it off the right numbers. If you look at, for instance, if you look at Slide 18, at PA, and it's on Slide 18 and you look at pricing, at $3 flat gas, it's a 21% rate of return; at a $4 flat price, it's 56%; at $5, it's over 100%. So, it's really price sensitive and really steep and the same thing is true in the Northeast with that going through it. When you look at -- and if you look at the strip out in 2014 and beyond, you're starting to see prices where you start to generate some really attractive returns in the dry areas. And the good news is we've got a really, again, we've got a really big bucket of dry gas opportunities, wet and super-rich opportunities and oil opportunities, and we have the operational flexibility to sort of throttle back and forth between those various buckets. And we're looking at maximizing the returns for the dollars we spent, most efficiently drive enough cash flow per share, production per share, reserves per share.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for closing remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thanks to our hard-working teams in each division Range is on target to meet our 2012 production goals within our capital budget. We're driving down our unit cost in the process. Because we have very large acreage positions in some of the best plays in the country, we should be able to achieve double-digit growth in production and reserves on a per-share basis, debt adjusted for many years. Plus we continue to be one of the lowest cost producers in our peer group and are still improving. Therefore, we believe that this will translate into significant shareholder value in months and years ahead.", "I want to say, before I thank everybody for participating on the call, let me just add to that. We're out of time and, in fact, we've over run time by 5 or 10 minutes and there's still some people queued up in Q&A. So please feel free, sorry, we didn't get to everybody, but follow-up with Rodney and the IR team and we'll make sure that we do our best to answer all your questions.

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions]", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney L. Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the fourth quarter, with record production and a continuing decrease in unit cost. Both earnings and cash flow per share results were greater than First Call consensus.", "Know that our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also, Mr. Pinkerton, our Executive Chairman, is on the call today. After the speakers, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.", "Range did file our 10-K with the SEC and is available this morning. It should be available on the home page of our website, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. And additionally, we posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed. Detailed information of our current hedge position by quarter are also included on the website.", "Now let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you, Rodney.", "We accomplished a lot in 2012 that really helps to set up 2013 and beyond for Range. We continue making progress with our plan of driving up production and reserves on a per-share basis while driving down costs. This is beginning to significantly flow through to our bottom line and will do so in an even more impactful way in 2013.", "Looking back at 2012, we sold $600 million of 5% senior subordinated 10-year notes. We also entered into an agreement with Sunoco and INEOS on Mariner East. To the best of my knowledge, Range will become the first company to export ethane from the U.S. by ship to international markets. This project also enabled us to export propane or to sell propane into the East Coast and North East U.S. markets. Importantly, Mariner East, along with our first 2 ethane projects, Mariner West and ATEX, enables Range to grow our Marcellus volumes in the wet portion of the play.", "In 2012, we sold our Ardmore Basin assets and some other miscellaneous assets for approximately $170 million. Last evening, we announced that we entered into an agreement to sell our New Mexico assets, plus the Powell Ranch property for $275 million.", "At year end 2012, our proved reserves increased 29% to 6.5 Tcfe. We replaced 773% of our production from drilling at an all-in cost of $0.86 per mcfe. Crude oil and NGL reserve volumes increased 64%, while natural gas reserves increased 20%.", "Our percentage of proved undeveloped reserves at end 2012 was reduced to 47%. Our unrisked unproved resource potential increased to 48 Tcfe to 68 Tcfe. This is comprised of 35 Tcf to 46 Tcf of natural gas, and 2.3 billion to 3.5 billion barrels of NGLs in crude oil.", "As a result of our development activity, we have moved 4.7 Tcf of unproved resource potential to proved reserves over the last 3 years. To put that in perspective, 4.7 Tcfe is more than our entire company's total reserves just 2 years ago. Because of this excellent performance, our total DD&A rate has declined from $2.32 per mcfe in 2009 to $1.62 in 2012, and the fourth quarter of 2012 was $1.46.", "Looking at the same time period, our operating expenses per mcfe declined from $0.83 to $0.41 in the fourth quarter of 2012 with $0.38. We've also made significant progress with our other unit costs, which Roger will discuss.", "Range turned in a very solid, profitable performance in 2012 marked by 36% production growth, a 32% reduction in unit lease operating cost and a 9% reduction in total unit cost. We increased reserves per share net adjusted by 22% over 2011 and increased production per share net adjusted by 29%. The bottom line is that Range is becoming much more capital efficient, and the results are beginning to flow through to net income.", "Looking forward into 2013, we believe the bottom line results should be even better. The lower DD&A rate for the full year, along with a lower per-unit operating expense for the entire year, coupled with improving well results should result in a substantial increase in Range's cash flow and profitability for this year.", "As we've previously announced, we're expecting production to grow at a rate of 20% to 25% for 2013. More importantly, we believe that we have line-of-sight growth of 20% to 25% for many years. All of this projected growth is in our existing plays. The reinvestment risk is low, and the projected rates of return are very good.", "The growth is mostly driven by our approximately 1 million net acre land position in Pennsylvania, specifically by low-risk, high-return drilling in the Marcellus Shale. In addition to the Marcellus Shale, we're projecting impactful growth from our approximately 160,000 net acre position in the Mississippian oil play in northern Oklahoma and Kansas. Given the high rate of return of our plays, which is led by our liquids-rich and oil plays, our cash flow should grow at a faster rate each year than our projected production growth of 20% to 25% per year. With our projections using current strip pricing, we reduce our leverage with time as we drive up production and cash flow.", "In addition to the Marcellus and Mississippian plays, we believe that we have great prospectivity in the Upper Devonian, Utica, Cline Shale and Wolfberry. Ray will update you on the progress in all of these plays.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.", "Ray N. Walker", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Our technical and operating teams have positioned us with large, high-quality acreage positions in the core sweet spots of some of the highest-quality plays with the best economics onshore U.S. We're continuing to see improvements in well performance, cost, LOEs and margins, resulting in increasing cash flow and higher returns. We're seeing significant growth in reserves in a time where reserve write-downs are common. We've made some highly innovative and strategic decisions in the midstream and downstream arenas that have opened up and solidified our logistics for marketing our oil, gas and NGLs with market-leading economics.", "The result is a portfolio of opportunities represented by large-scale, low-risk, high-quality acreage positions that allow for long-term economies of scale. We believe these opportunities will yield consistent and significant growth for many years to come.", "Let me start with a few comments on reserves. I think it's critical that we point out that even in light of greatly reduced natural gas prices, we had exceptional growth of reserves in 2012. We recognized a 29% gain in total reserves year-over-year while decreasing our PUD percentage by 10% and increasing liquids reserves by 64%.", "We decreased the ratio of PUDs to proved developed in the Marcellus from 1.7 down to 1.2. We think all of this speaks volumes about our asset quality, especially when considering that we've moved 4.7 Tcf equivalent of potential to proved reserves over the past 3 years and yet we still increased our resource potential in 2012 by 12%. Again, it's a true reflection of our large de-risked and high-quality assets, as well as the exceptional performance of our teams.", "Now let me point out a few things about the Marcellus. I'd like to make 4 points. Let me summarize first and then I'll go through in more detail.", "Number one, we have a large, high-quality position that we control; number two, our position is largely de-risked; number three, well performance and economics continue to improve; and number four, our marketing team has us well positioned for future growth.", "So now let me expand on those points.", "Number one. Not only do we have approximately 1 million net acres in Pennsylvania, of which a large portion is prospective for the Marcellus, we believe our acreage encompasses very high-quality reservoir rock in both the dry and liquids-rich areas. We've been working for years now to consolidate and high grade our acreage positions and, in essence, we believe not only have quantity, we have exceptional quality in core areas.", "Number two. Our position is largely de-risked in Southwest and Northeast Pennsylvania. To illustrate, in 2006, on my very first trip to Pennsylvania, I was up there to work on the very first horizontal well, which was the fifth well ever spud in the Marcellus. Today, there are approximately 7,000 Marcellus wells that are either drilling, completing or producing. Marcellus is producing close to 9 Bcf equivalent per day and is now the largest-producing gas field in the U.S. and still growing. For the last couple of years, Marcellus operators have begun exchanging data, analyses and results on a regular basis, resulting in everyone going up the learning curve a whole lot faster.", "If you look at Slide 12 and also at Slide 30 in our presentation on the website, you can see why we say that our acreage is largely de-risked by thousands of wells with now up to 7 years of production history. This is a large part of why we believe we have line-of-sight growth and can consistently grow at 20% to 25% corporately in the future.", "Number three, we are continuing to see improving well performance, better efficiencies and are implementing well designs that continue to improve our returns all across the Marcellus. In our investor presentation, we've updated our economics for the wet and super-rich areas, reflective of our 2012 performance. The wet area wells went up to 8.7 Bcf equivalent, which is made up of 712,000 barrels of liquids and 4.4 Bcf of gas, which calculates 49% liquids. And for the super-rich area, our EUR is now 1.44 million Boe, which is 824,000 barrels of liquids and 3.7 Bcf of gas, which is 57% liquids. Importantly, in the super-rich area, the condensate is 109,000 barrels as compared to 27,000 barrels in the wet area. Also, the new economics for the wet and super-rich areas now reflect full ethane extraction as we will commence extracting and selling ethane this year.", "Of note, let me point out a 3-well pad in the super-rich area that came online since our last call at a combined rate of over 6,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's an average of over 2,000 Boe per day each. The wells on that pad had an average lateral length of 3,358 feet in 18 stages, and the combined production was 1,200 barrels of condensate, almost 3,000 barrels of NGLs and 11.7 million gas, which means the production is over 68% liquids, of which 29% of the liquids is condensate.", "Just last month, we brought online another super-rich area pad with just 2 wells that averaged 3,356 foot laterals, with 17- and 18-stage completions that produced a combined total of 6,866 Boe per day, which is 793 barrels of condensate, 3,200 barrels of NGLs and 16.9 million of gas, which is 59% liquids, of which 20% of that was condensate. I think these 5 wells clearly illustrate the exciting potential of the super-rich area. We're continuing to see improving well performance and EURs as we implement better landing targets, RCS completions, longer laterals and more efficient frac designs. Our teams are continually introducing innovative technologies and strategic analysis techniques, and we still believe we'll see significant additional improvements in the future.", "And number four, we have midstream infrastructure, transportation arrangements, sales contracts and marketing deals in place to handle our production well into the future. Our team has literally been working for years on highly strategic and innovative solutions for all of our products. The recent ethane arrangements are excellent examples of these types of innovative solutions, which opened up entirely new markets like the international markets via Mariner East. These solutions position us with industry-leading returns and some of the lowest fee arrangements, connecting us to some of the best markets, including the premium-priced international markets.", "So in the Marcellus, number one, we have a large, high-quality position that we control; number two, it's largely de-risked by thousands of wells and actual production; number three, well performance and economics continue to improve; and number four, our marketing team has us positioned strategically to move our products with industry-leading terms for years to come.", "In summary, we believe we're positioned for line-of-sight growth with great economics for many years.", "In the Mississippian play, we have approximately 160,000 net acres located along the Nemaha Ridge. Like the Marcellus, we believe it's really important where your acreage is located, and we believe our position on the ridge is highly prospective. Please refer to the press release for the details of the wells brought online in the fourth quarter.", "I'd like to point out that we're still seeing great results, and we recently brought online a well at over 810 Boe per day. Also, we're announcing the 30-day rates of the 2 fourth quarter wells, and those wells are averaging over 800 and 600 Boe per day for the 30 days. We have 5 rigs running, and the current plan is to bring online 51 wells and 17 salt water disposal wells this year.", "We will deploy the majority of our capital and resources in 2013 in the wet and super-rich Marcellus and the Mississippian oil play, with the split being approximately 80% to the Marcellus and 15% to the Mississippian.", "I'd like to now move on and bring you up to speed on the other projects in our portfolio, namely the Wolfberry, the Cline and the wet Utica in Northwest Pennsylvania. Our position in all 3 of these plays is predominantly HBP. And therefore, we fully control the timing of development.", "While we had to bear essentially all the cost of the learning curve in the Marcellus and, to some extent, in the Mississippian, we can enjoy a less risky approach in these 3 areas. Because we are largely HBP, we can allow industry to move up the learning curve and bear those costs while we focus our capital and our resources in our lower-risk, lower-costs and higher-rate-of-return projects like the wet and super-rich Marcellus. This is a great position to be in.", "So in West Texas, the Wolfberry and Cline continue to see significant activity offsetting our Conger Field. In the Wolfberry, we drilled and completed 5 wells in 2012. We saw the cost of the Wolfberry wells decrease by over 30% in just those few wells in 2012. Our plan in 2013 is to drill 5 additional Wolfberry wells and do a few recompletions while we monitor the considerable offset activity throughout the year.", "Our third Cline well had a max 24-hour rate of 620 Boe per day, and it was a 4,000-foot lateral with 16 stages. Industry is drilling quite a few wells in the area with much longer laterals and more stages. In fact, if you look at Slide 53 in our presentation, you can see there's a lot of activity directly offsetting our position. In the Cline, we believe there will be close to 50 wells drilled all around our Conger Field this year by Devon, Oxy, Apache, Laredo, FireWheel and others. Our team is actively working with the offset operators to exchange data and better understand the play. Importantly, there are now significant tests near our position with impressive production rates, indicating that the play could have significant upside.", "In summary, we're excited about the potential, and it appears we'll learn a lot more about this play throughout the year.", "Let me now update you on the first test well of the wet Utica in Northwest Pennsylvania. It had 285 feet of thickness, it's got all the right liquids-rich characteristics, good reservoir pressure, and the initial test rate was 1.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Along with the cores and logs, we did perform a significant amount of diagnostics during the completion. Those diagnostics determined that our completion was not optimal as it frac-ed mostly out of zone. However, there is good direction as to how we optimize the next step in order to achieve a better completion by moving the target and changing our frac designs. We have seen this in other areas like the Marcellus, and it certainly indicates a really good way going forward. We're working closely with our partner, Cabot, and offset operators to exchange data and results.", "If you look at Slide 46 on our presentation, you can identify this well and our 181,000 net acre position, along with significant offset activity by operators like Halc\u00f3n, Hilcorp, Seneca, Shell and Chevron. We believe there will be approximately a dozen wells drilled, offsetting our position this year, and we'll, of course, be monitoring closely as we work on the timing of the next test. Being this is a new area, we have a lot to learn, and the good news is we like what we see. The area has all the right ingredients, the right TOC, the right liquids characteristics, the right pressures, and we have a lot of science indicating what the next step should be.", "I continue to be very proud of our efforts in safety, environmental protections, community stewardship and communications. On the safety front, for example, our OSHA incident rate for 2012 was 19% better than the peer group, and our lost time rate was 21% better than the peer group. Although the only acceptable rate is 0, we are seeing steady and measurable improvement. It's a core value here at Range, and we definitely see it translate to the bottom line.", "Like Jeff said, 2012 was an important year and it sets the stage well for a terrific 2013. We believe that with our assets and our great team, we can grow significantly and consistently for many years to come.", "Now over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny", "Thanks, Ray.", "Any way you look at it, the fourth quarter was a great one, both operationally and financially. Strong production growth, improved capital efficiency, lower unit costs and better realized prices led to significant top line and bottom line growth.", "The fourth quarter of 2012 saw a notable improvement in cash margins and cash flow from the prior quarter. Cash margin was $3.12 in mcfe, up 22% from the third quarter, and cash flow was $248 million, up 31% from the third quarter figure.", "Cash flow per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter was $1.54, $0.18 above analyst consensus estimate and 14% above the fourth quarter of last year. EBITDAX for the fourth quarter was $287 million.", "For the entire year, cash flow totaled $756 million, 2% higher than the 2011 figure, and EBITDAX for all of 2012 was $910 million. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter and full year 2012 was $53 million and $13 million, respectively.", "Fourth quarter earnings, calculated using analyst methodology, were $73 million, or $0.46 per fully diluted share, that's $0.17 above the analysts' consensus estimate. As Rodney mentioned, the Range corporate website contains detailed non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations of these non-GAAP figures that I just referenced.", "Looking closely at the income statement, there was a line item reclassification this quarter. As our Appalachian production volume has grown, we have engaged in limited third-party gas purchases and resales solely to accommodate seasonal swings in regional supply and demand. To better reflect this activity, we have reclassified the associated revenue and expense under the income statement caption Brokered Natural Gas and Marketing. This activity previously netted into other revenue and it's conducted to support our marketing effort, and it's not intended to operate as a separate profit center. We expect this activity on its own will at best be breakeven and seasonal.", "Moving to the cost structure performance in the fourth quarter, cash direct operating costs, including workovers, came in at $0.38 per mcfe. That's $0.02 below last quarter and $0.07 below the fourth quarter of last year. One of the truths in the E&P business is that it costs more to operate an oil or gas -- wet gas well than it does a flowing dry gas well. So with our liquids production rising, sooner or later, our unit operating costs are going to flatten and possibly begin to increase slightly. Fortunately, quarter-after-quarter, our production teams have done such a terrific job reducing operating cost. We have thus far enjoyed the higher profit margins that come with liquids without the higher unit costs associated with greater liquids production. And if we're able to continue this trend, the first quarter 2013 cash direct operating cost, including workovers, should be relatively flat at $0.38 to $0.40 in mcfe.", "Third party gathering, transportation and compression expense was $0.71 in mcfe. That's the same as last quarter, and $0.11 higher than last year, reflecting the continued build out of our gathering lines and related systems. This expense is anticipated to be up slightly in the first quarter to between $0.75 and $0.77 in mcfe.", "Production in ad valorem taxes for the fourth quarter totaled $0.12 per mcfe, $0.02 higher than last year due to higher Pennsylvania impact fees. The Pennsylvania impact fee amounted to $6.5 million during the fourth quarter, or $0.09 per mcfe based on total company production.", "Now first quarter 2013 production taxes, including a $6.2 million impact fee estimate, should be in the $0.14 to $0.15 per mcfe range, reflecting both higher prices and first quarter Pennsylvania drilling activity.", "Exploration expense in the fourth quarter, excluding non-cash comp, was $17 million, or $7 million below last year, mostly due to lower seismic expenditures. Now based on our 2013 seismic budget, first quarter 2013 exploration expense should be in the $18 million to $20 million range.", "Abandonment and impairment of unproved property during the fourth quarter was $21 million, and we anticipate this quarterly expense to decline in 2013, with a first quarter estimate of $15 million to $17 million.", "Cash G&A expense was $0.40 in mcfe in the fourth quarter, $0.06 lower than last quarter and $0.17 lower than last year's fourth quarter.", "We continue to see improvement in unit cost G&A as we gain economies of scale in our high-growth, large-scale plays. We expect first quarter cash G&A to be around $0.40 to $0.42 in mcfe.", "As last year's Range capital program was heavily front-end loaded, our fourth quarter production increased much faster than our debt, which effectively reduced our interest expense per mcfe in the fourth quarter down to $0.58 in mcfe. First quarter 2013 should see this figure decline further to approximately $0.55 to $0.57.", "The highly favorable 2012 drilling results reported in our January 30 reserves release have already begun flowing through the income statement. Reflecting continued improvement in our capital efficiency, our fourth quarter DD&A rate declined to $1.46 per mcfe. This rate is $0.23 lower than last year and places Range among the very best of our peer group that employ the Successful Efforts Accounting method. The DD&A rate will vary slightly from quarter-to-quarter based on production mix. And we expect the DD&A rate in the first quarter to be between $1.46 and $1.48 in mcfe.", "Now turning over to the balance sheet for a moment. There are 2 items to highlight. First, in late December, we used $259 million of our revolving bank credit facility to fully redeem, including expenses, our $250 million of callable 7 1/2% senior sub-notes that were scheduled to mature in 2017. The early redemption will reduce interest expense. And with over $1 billion in available borrowing capacity remaining under the bank borrowing base, the redemption does not materially affect our liquidity.", "Second, during the fourth quarter, we closed on our Ardmore Woodford asset sale. And as Jeff mentioned, most recently, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portion of our Permian Basin assets for approximately $275 million, subject to usual closing adjustments.", "Now adjusting our year end 2012 debt balance for the completed and expected asset sale proceeds reduces our debt to trailing 4-quarter EBITDAX ratio to a pro forma figure of 2.9x. As we have said before, while we are comfortable with our leverage in the low 3x range, bringing the ratio back below 3x in 2013 has been one of our objectives. And when the Permian asset sale closes, we should be back below the 3x level.", "Now for many years, Range has relied upon a disciplined hedging program to provide certainty of cash flow so that we may more effectively plan and execute our capital program. And from 2009 through 2012, our hedging program has provided just over $900 million in revenue to help fund our projects. During the fourth quarter of 2012 and year-to-date 2013, we have continued to add to our hedge position with approximately 70% of our 2013 natural gas hedged at a floor price of $4.18 in Mmbtu, and over 80% of our 2013 oil production hedged at a floor price of $94.65 a barrel.", "Please reference our press release and website for detailed hedge volumes and prices for 2013 through 2015.", "In summary, thanks to the hard work of our employees, the fourth quarter was -- of 2012 was an outstanding quarter by all measures, significant increases in production at lower unit cost, driving improved cash flow and earnings. With one asset sale closed last quarter and another under contract, leverage has declined from its third quarter 2012 peak. Going forward, continued capital discipline, cost control and production growth should lead to another year of success.", "Jeff, back to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Dan, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ron Mills of Johnson Rice.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "Just on the Mississippian. You've talked about your portion of the play, and the results in your portion of the play along the Nemaha Ridge have been different and a little bit better than to the western part in terms of EURs and potential spacing. When you look at your Mississippian and the 80-acre spacing and the longer laterals, can you talk about some of the variability? And how much of that is driven by the chat and how the presence of that chat in -- if that creates variability, how you work through that?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes. Sure, Ron. This is Ray. It's a good question. The Nemaha Ridge -- well, let me back up and kind of step out broader. The Mississippian, and Jeff said it before, and I think most of us agree, is a huge stratigraphic play and it's going to have structural enhancements. And we believe one of those structural enhancements is the Nemaha Uplift. And one of the enhancements on the Uplift is the fact that there is more chat present in general, and the chat has a lot higher porosity, better perms. So i.e., more storage capacity for hydrocarbons there. It is a very diverse and unconventional type structure, so we are still really, really early. When you look at the amount of acreage that we have in our 160,000-acre position there, just a few wells literally that we've drilled to date. So what we've done is very similar to what we did in the Marcellus, and we're going to show you what the wells are doing, good, bad and ugly as time goes on. So what you see in our presentation is what the wells look like that we did, the early vintage, 2009 to '11, which were primarily shorter laterals, and came in at around, I think, 485 Mboe-type wells. And then the 2012 wells, which look like they're on -- around a 600 Mboe-type curve, and all of that is in our presentation, so what we'll continue to do is set that out there. But literally, we don't have enough wells yet to understand or be able to predict what the whole thing will do. So we're going to take again an approach we did very much like the Marcellus and just tell you what the data looks like as time goes on. So quarter-by-quarter, we'll continue to update those curves, and we'll just put that data out there. And you'll know what we know going forward.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. Let me tack onto that a little bit. I think -- if you look on Slide 48, it's on our website, and what it shows is the historical cumulative oil production per well from the Mississippian. This is looking at all the historical vertical wells, and there's a lot of them. And by far and away, the best vertical wells in the play are on the northern part of the Nemaha Uplift in Kay County, Cowley and Sumner up into Kansas, right through that little area. The vertical wells in Kay County are the highest. They're at 85,000 barrels per well. If you think about a horizontal well, really, it's a multiplier of a vertical. So a horizontal could be, in any play, really 3x a vertical, 4x, 5x, 6x or whatever. So one good indication of where the best horizontal wells are going to be is look where the best vertical wells are. So -- and to compare that, if you go way off to the western side of that map, or that stratigraphic trap shown in green, as Ray mentioned, the vertical wells, say, in Woods, Barber, Comanche counties are 13,000 barrels, 22,000 versus 85,000. So they're significantly different. And then there's a slide right next to it, on 49, that shows -- as you go far west, the other thing that happens is the play gets gassier. So we are, there's better vertical wells, higher oil cuts. Then the question is why, and it's back to those things that Ray said. We think when you're up on the Uplift, or the things you mentioned, Rod, early on, when you're on the Uplift, you're -- one, you're higher structurally, which we think is a positive; two, you have a chat component that when you're on the uplift that you have, but when you're off it, you tend to lose. In fact, it's not just being on the uplift, you've got to be on the northern part of the uplift to have that chat component, plus, you have a higher degree of fracturing up on the uplift which enhances permeability. So we think that's what supports better vertical wells, so far, or better horizontal wells. And then like Ray said, we'll just update you with time as they are just like we did in the Marcellus.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "And is that also driving a little bit tighter spacing on your portion or what's driving the potential for tighter spacing versus...", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes. If you go to Slide 47, and what drives that, because you have that chat component, you have higher porosity, you have better storage and you have a higher oil cut, you have more hydrocarbon in place. On Slide 47, when you look at where we are, the EUR under those various types of completions, even if you use 600,000 boes per well, we're only recovering 6% to 11% of the oil in place, so a very reasonable recovery with that kind of well, so that's what drives the tighter spacing is really 2 things, it's higher hydrocarbon in place, and then just simplistically, we have a higher oil cut. Again, going back to where we are on Slide 49, in Kay County and Cowley County, Kansas, those 2 areas, 92%, 95% of the wells are oil wells. So if you go up to the west side of the map, somewhere between 38% and 47% of the wells are oil wells. So it's a lot gassier. And generally speaking, the gassier you are, the wider the spacing. The oilier you are, the tighter the spacing. The more hydrocarbon in place, the tighter the spacing, the less, the wider the spacing. So that's why we think what we think and it's supported by the wells we've drilled so far and we'll just keep updating you.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "And then just to clarify on the Utica, it sounds like technically, it has all the characteristics you want. Is it just a matter of finding where within the 285-foot of pay is the optimal place to land the lateral to allow you to effectively stimulate the Utica/Point Pleasant? And is there something, if I look at your map, it looks like a lot of industry activity to this point is really focused on the central to southern part of your acreage through Crawford, Venango, and Mercer County. Is that just because we have more core data from vertical wells in that area or is there something that you think changes as you move North and East into Warren County?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, let me start with the first question. I mean we are very encouraged by what we see. It's the first well in a pretty big area. And when you combine what we learned on this well with what we're -- the little bit of data we have so far from working with the offset operators, it's a very encouraging area. I mean, we saw TOCs by volume in the 10% range. We got a good pressure. We got 63 gravity condensate. Everything is lining up exactly like it should. But when you drill a first well like that, we went up the learning curve and we spent a lot of money in the Marcellus trying to figure out the ultimate best landing target. And here we are, several years later, we're still optimizing that and making big improvements. And a lot of these recent well improvements that we see in the super-rich and wet areas is very much that, it's landing the target in the right place and pumping the right-sized frac job so that you optimally stimulate what you're trying to go after and not stimulate a bunch of other rock and connect up a bunch of rock that does you no good. What we saw in the Utica was we simply put the target in what we thought was the best spot at that point with the data that we have. But clearly, when it frac-ed, we now know that the frac did not go where we wanted it to. So that means we take that data, we have a lot of right mechanics data, full core data, all that stuff that tells us we need to put our target in a different spot in the next test. So our plan, again, is to HBP so we can kind of sit back and we can kind of control our own destiny, and we've talked with our partner, they're very much on board with this. They also are very encouraged by it. And so we're going to sit back and trade information with some offset operators, see what some of their experiences are, and then we'll kind of figure out what the timing of our next test should be. But the good news is, I can't say it strong enough, I mean we're really encouraged that we think we know exactly what to do next time. And 1.4 million cubic feet a day equivalent test, while disappointing, is not a bad test. I mean it did make 1.5 million a day, so it's a pretty decent well. So we're pretty encouraged by the area. But again, it's HBP, we can sit back. We don't have really hardly any capital allocated to it this year. This year, we're really focusing on the super-rich and wet Marcellus, that's where 80% of our liquids are going. And our 80% of our capital and resources are going. And I always want to direct you back to -- did I tell you about those 5 wells that we just brought online? And then if you're looking in the super-rich area, in 2012, we've brought online 51 wells there and we're saying the average is 1.44 million boe per well. I mean that's phenomenal stuff and that's where we're focusing our time and resources and science this year in that area, because it's really phenomenal and with these recent wells, we're getting real excited about what we've got there.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Let me, again, add on a little bit to what Ray is saying. To look at that first Utica test, 285 feet of pay, and we got 1.4 million, 63 gravity condensate, good pressure, all that kind of stuff. Go back and look at the initial Marcellus wells. To put it in context, the Marcellus in Washington County is about a 80 to 100 feet thick, 110 feet thick where a lot of the stuff we're drilling. Here, it's 3x thicker. Going back to the first 3 Marcellus, and I've told the story several times and it's sort of fun telling. The first 3 wells, if you just look within that 100 feet, one of those wells was landed at the bottom, it made 20 Mcf a day, the one in the middle made about 200, the one at the top made about 700. And that was our first 3 Marcellus tries. We ended up just moving the fourth well. Actually Bill Zagorski, the -- now considered the father of the Marcellus, drew a little 3-point correlation, and said, \"Hey, move it up a little bit, change where you landed it within that 100 foot interval, just move it up at the top a little more,\" and the fourth well was 3.4 million a day. And then now when we're drilling and completing with what we learned right in that same area, the wells are 10 million a day plus a lot of liquids, I'm going on an equivalent basis. So you think about here, now you've got instead of a 100-foot to play with like in the Marcellus, you got 285 feet. So the fact that we've got 1.4 million a day from something that's really ineffectively stimulated if we land it properly and stimulate it effectively, what could the well be? Clearly, in the Marcellus, we cracked the code, and now it's the largest producing gas field in the country, that we have a million net acres in the state, a lot of which is prospected for. So we're excited about the position, 190,000 net acres, it has all the right ingredients. And it's part of our dream factor. Now, we're part of the upside. Like Ray said, we're going to be driven by that 1 million acre position that's going to give us the 20% to 25% line-of-sight growth for many years. I'm going to be delevering with time, even with the little bit of outspend, it puts us in a great position. And we've got great upside in all those in the Utica, coupled with all the things that Ray said earlier. We're still excited about the Cline, the Wolfberry, the Upper Devonian, looks very, very encouraging, and in the Mississippian as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I've got a couple. If I could go back to the Mississippian real quick, when you think about capital allocation, you guys have talked about moving up to 10 rigs and maybe 15 rigs over the next couple of years, hold acreage, how should we think about how you're allocating capital in terms of -- does that take money away from something else in terms of activity levels? And this is as a follow-on to Ron's question, can you just confirm that you are using geoscience down at the Mississippi at this point?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "What was the last sentence? We heard you up to the last sentence.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Are you guys -- there's been a lot of debate over the effectiveness of using geoscience in the Mississippi. I just wanted to check where you guys are in that side of the debate.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Define what is geoscience -- using geoscience?", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Seismic to avoid faulting basically.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. Let me start with capital allocation. We've always been driven by the same strategy. And our strategy is we want to consistently grow production and reserves per share on a debt-adjusted basis, with one of the best cost structures out there, build and high-grade the inventory. We direct our -- simplistically, we direct our capital into our highest rate of return, best economic projects that we have that are large-scale and repeatable. Clearly, that's right now the Marcellus. And no matter what happens, it's almost hard to think that it would be anything other than the Marcellus because we have a million net acres in the state of Pennsylvania, all of which is not only highly prospective for the Marcellus but it's highly prospective, a lot of it, for the Upper Devonian and the Utica. So really, because it's a little bit stacked pays in areas we're in, you can argue that instead of having a million net acres, we have 3 million net acres or 2.5 million net acres or something like that. And again, I mean, the Marcellus has up to 7 years' worth of history. And like Ray said, 7,000 wells now that define when we drill in there, we have great upside and great prospectivity. And just to drive home the point, when you look at Slide -- and I'm flipping through the package, when you look at just the south -- or when you look at Slide 13, and this just considers the southwest portion of our position. It ignores -- just looking at 540,000 net acres, using 80-acre spacing, which I think is extremely conservative, I would argue and we have pilots we haven't talked about, you can down space that and we've got good evidence, we just haven't put it out yet. And some of those down space pilots are 2 years old. But ignoring that, we still have 6,750 wells to drill. So if you look at what we've drilled so far, we've only drilled 6% of our acreage. So as of roughly year end, on a net basis, we have 470 million per day coming from 6% of our acreage. If you do the simplistic math and assumed it was all the same and you can argue, there's enough data down there to tell you there's going to be high-quality wells all through there, and you divide 470 million by 0.06, that's 7.8 boes per day. I've said many, many times, I think our Marcellus position is, again, just looking at a part of it, without down spacing, has the potential to get us to 2 to 3 boes per day. And we said corporately, we're going to grow line of sight 20% to 25% for many years, which gets you to that rate in relatively short order when you're growing at that kind of compounded rate. So our capital is going to be driven -- our capital allocation is driven by high rate of return, large-scale repeatable projects. That's why 80% roughly of our capital is going to go into the play, and then a high percentage of our capital will continue to go in there. That being said, if you look at the Mississippian, what we said, we have 160,000 net acres, we think is very well positioned up on the Nemaha Ridge for all those reasons we just said, that I won't repeat, when Ron asked. So we think all that acreage is highly prospective. The difference is the Marcellus has 7 years' worth of history with brand new horizontal wells and high quality data and there's 7,000 new wells that define it. In the Mississippian, we're just starting. We started there in 2004, but we started in the Tonkawa and then we started with our vertical program. We drilled a number of good vertical wells. Then we converted in 2009 to '11 and drilled a handful of good horizontal wells. And we reported those, over 485,000 boe. They're still hanging in there, they look good. Last year, we drilled a handful of wells, more horizontal, but it's still a handful of wells. And those wells were 600,000. And we'll update you with time. But when you look at -- so it's new drilling and it's really just across the southern part of our play, almost spans the width of the ridge, but it's not 7 years' worth of history and 7,000 wells, it's a couple years' worth of history and 20 or 30 wells. So as with time, if the Mississippi continues to drill out, and it may or may not as we go north. Hopefully, it's just like the Marcellus and it does, and if it does, then we'll continue to ramp up our drilling, 5 to 10 to 15 rigs, and we'll do that. But again, the big driver, the big gorilla is the Marcellus. It's the largest producing gas field in the country. We've got the dominant position in it. And we've got line-of-sight growth to grow for many years. And these other plays were all enhancements to that. If the Cline drills out or the Wolfberry, you'll see us allocate a little capital, and the capital allocation is really driven by rate of return, by economics, large-scale and repeatability.", "Ray N. Walker", "That was a long-winded answer but it was a great question, and that's how we think about it.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess my follow-up, hopefully, is a little quicker.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Alan Farquharson just reminded me, I want to answer one of your questions. It was -- you brought up the geoscience or seismic. So still want to answer the question. We do use seismic in a lot of the areas we drill and we use them for different reasons. So early on, and it goes back to the history of Tonkawa field, we got in Tonkawa, which is the big part of our Mississippian position. It's that group of wells on the southern end. And when you look at that position on the southern end, it was the largest light oil field back in the 1917, 1920, in that era. And what we did is start reactivating it by drilling Tonkawa wells. After successfully doing that, a couple of years later, we shot a 3D over it, which, at the time, amazed me as Chief Operating Officer, and those guys, after a great sales pitch, said, \"Hey, we wanted to 3D it.\" I said, \"How in the world could you have missed anything?\" There's a gazillion wells out there and being an engineer, I'm thinking that -- and but sure enough, when you look, it has that same characteristic like a lot of our plays. It's stacked pay. It's not just the Tonkawa, it was the Mississippian below. And remember the Tonkawa was at 2,700 feet, the Mississippian is at 4,000, then they had some neat stuff in the Red Fork, and then the Wilcox. And then the Woodford. And so even though basement's relatively high and it's -- you're looking at that interval from 2,700 feet to 5,000 or 5,500 feet, there's 20-some stacked pays in there that are all oil charge. So we started drilling deeper and the seismic was actually useful to help identify all those different upsides and targets. Again, on a broader basis, if you look at the other areas we're in like Pennsylvania, great stack pay potential, and we talk a lot about the Upper Devonian, we talk about the Marcellus and we talk about the Utica, but I guarantee you, there's tons of conventional pays that are stacked in there. So seismic helps us identify, look at those other targets, it helps us target wells. So it's useful as a tool. It's not critical. It wasn't -- I won't say it's critical in the Marcellus or it's critical in the Mississippian, but clearly, it adds value not only in those horizons but helping us understand the full section in the hydrocarbon charge and what we have.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan McSpirit of BMO Capital Markets.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "The question is often asked of producers, when will operations turn cash flow neutral or cash flow positive? Is that in itself a goal of Range Resources or important to the company? And if it is, how do you balance that with accelerating the resource capture and bringing the value forward?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "That's a great question. And I think if you look at our plan and what we're saying today and I think what we're saying consistently is, we believe we have 20% to 25% line-of-sight production growth for many years, and it's all that stuff and part of the answer to the previous question. And based on our modeling and based on current strip pricing and with all the assumptions that go with it, but a very bottom's up driven plan based on thousands of wells and all the guys in the divisions and led by Ray and Alan and others. When you look at that plan, we can outspend cash flow by $250 million to $350 million per year, still grow at 20% to 25%, but importantly, we're delevering with time, and I'm going to talk a little bit about it, then turn it over to Roger. So when you look at like debt to EBITDAX, our debt to EBITDAX, even with that outspend, continues to drift down with time. If you think about NAV and pulling the value forward, okay, I'm just simplistically, again, if we're growing at 20% to 25% on a compounded basis, roughly, every 3 years, we'll double. So we would double in 3 years and double again. So if you take our fourth quarter volumes at -- roughly, I'm rounding down to 800 million or 0.8 boes per day net, in 3 years, you're looking at roughly 1.6 growing at that compounded rate, if we can successfully do that and we've got the database and all those wells to say we believe we can, led by our million-acre position in Pennsylvania, then we're doubling from 0.8 to 1.6 in roughly 3 years. And then in roughly another 3 years, we'll be at roughly 3 boes per day, which is a number that I talked about earlier. To me, that's pulling forward a heck of a lot of value. And then what's great about that, it's in largely low risk plays with strong economics and strong returns and a very low cost structure. When we talk about our resource potential being enormous and we put a number out there, but it's based on a ton of data and a ton of support in the best play -- best gas play, clearly, out there, I would argue one of the best plays overall. So we think we're pulling forward a lot of NAV. We think we're aggressively driving up production with time and delevering by outspending by $250 million to $350 million per year. Roger, do you want to tack on with that?", "Roger S. Manny", "Yes. Yes, I will. Thanks, Jeff. Yes, Dan, I think becoming cash flow positive or cash flow neutral in and of itself is not real high on our priority list. We're much more concerned about bringing the NAV forward, drilling up our high return projects. I mean, there's a lot of companies out there that are cash flow positive because they don't have anything economic to drill right now. We're not that company. So deciding where we set the drilling throttle, where we allocate capital. As you probably know, having followed the company, every AFE over $200,000, is signed off on by Alan, Jeff, me, Ray, all individually. So we're very granular and very thorough in our capital allocation decisions. So at this point in our growth cycle, I think just as Jeff described, you're going to see us keep the drilling throttle at we consider an optimal setting, where we're probably still slightly overspending but still delevering and keeping leverage in check.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Got it. I appreciate that answer. I look at cash flow neutral state more of a result than a goal myself, so in agreement there. Another subject often discussed is the difference between returns at the field level, and of course, those at the corporate level, there being a disconnect between the 2. Where do you see returns at the corporate level maybe measured by return on capital employed trending over the next several years?", "Roger S. Manny", "Yes. That's a good question, Dan. I mean return on capital employed is a tough one, because you can reduce your capital spending and you look like a rock star and you're not really bringing NAV forward and painting the value that you could, it's a suboptimal way to develop your resource base. So I think it's a troublesome measure in and of itself. I think in my case, it's a little like NAV. You want to adjust the inputs and see what happens to the outputs, it's the relative measure that counts. And when you look at the relative measures at Range, the DD&A rate falling, I think is a really key and underappreciated metric. When you look out there over the last year, there -- it used to be the DD&A rates of the E&P sector moved somewhat in tandem, albeit, differences between the full costers [ph] and the successful efforts guys. But lately, what we've seen is companies with big feelings it has to write down. So its DD&A rate actually went -- goes up, which is very odd. And Range is one of the few that has consistently seen our DD&A rate go down, and that's clearly an indication of our improved capital efficiency and lower cost structure, which, to your point, will flow to the bottom line. It's why we just had our second year of consecutive profitability on a net income basis despite really low, low prices the last 2 years.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I think as we continue to build volumes in high-quality plays like the Marcellus, more and more of that's going to flow through to the bottom line or the net income. You're seeing it now, you're going to see it a lot more this year and off in to the future.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Understood. And one last one for me, if I may. Do you have the itch to sell more Permian Basin properties based on the attractive price received in the recent deal here? I ask simply in the context of present value. Why not monetize the asset today and recycle the cash, the capital into higher return drilling opportunities found, say, in the wet gas Marcellus or the Mississippian?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, that's a great question. We look at that stuff all the time and we constantly look at what we think adds the most value for the company. Well, I think we're in a great shape, again 20% to 25% line-of-sight growth. We got great balance sheet, Roger does a fantastic job monitoring that. And periodically, I mean, look back, we've sold $2.3 billion worth of property so we're not in love with our assets. We're trying to be one of the best performing companies out there, not just growth for growth's sake, but it's better is better, not necessarily bigger is better. But when you look -- so we have great opportunity. And where we're positioned now, we have the ability with that small outspend to continue to grow significantly with time. That being said, we've cleaned up, and clearly, New Mexico for us was only 7,000 net acres. It was a relatively small position. We got a great price for it. We didn't see a lot of upside. It wasn't going to move the needle for us. The Ardmore Basin sale was the same thing, I think it was 14,000 net acres. What we really we have left in the Permian is Conger. Conger is different, I think, and it's something to look at, and we need to understand a little bit better. Conger -- our Conger -- basically 100,000 net acres, but in essence, it's almost all of which is held by production. Goes back, it has those same characteristics. We own all depth rights, it's stacked pay, rich hydrocarbon charge. It worked well for us in the Canyon. And if you -- for the people that have been with us for a while, it works well. In the Cisco, it's worked in the Wolfcamp, it's worked in the Leonard. We've drilled some great, strong wells. Now, we're looking at a couple of other horizons or techniques. One is the Cline. The Cline has roughly 300-foot of net thickness across the entire 100,000 net acres. And like Ray said, it's really important. There's going to be a lot of data points coming out this year. We have really high quality operators surrounding us who are going to drill roughly 50 wells that are going to impact our position. The results of their wells will be very meaningful for what we have on our property. Like Ray said, we carried 100% of the R&D in the Marcellus. We don't have to do it out in Conger. But to the extent that works in the Cline, we got 100,000 net acres and you could drill oil wells, could you drill oil wells on 80-acre spacing? I think, clearly, and you could argue, maybe it ought to be tighter, 40 or something. If you used 80-acre spacing, that's over 1,000 wells. If you use 40, it's over 2000 wells. And you can pick numbers. What if the Cline works and the Cline -- the wells stabilize at 50 barrels a day a year out or something, even on the low end, that's over 60,000 barrels net and it's predominantly oil. On the high end, it could be double that. The Wolfberry, stacked payer out there, we're doing a lot of interesting things in the Wolfberry. Our Wolfberry wells are better than competitors so far, again, it's HBP, we're learning a little bit, but that could become a very repeatable play and really even expand beyond what we've talked about publicly so far. So it has a lot of upside. And we want to understand what that is before we decide what to do. I can tell you as a shareholder in the bulk of my net worth, I'm rooting that it works, that's another great opportunity for us. Because going back to that simple strategy of growing production and reserves on a per share basis, net adjusted, and building and high-grading the inventory, who knows, it may be a high-grade. The Marcellus for us, back in 2004 and '05 and '06, was a huge high-grade than what we were doing and really helped to drive results. I think Conger has the ability to be a significant high-grade and it's clearly oil, which could be beneficial.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company.", "Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "How should we think about lateral length in the Marcellus and the balance that Range has to strike between holding acreage and maximizing well economics? Essentially, do you think your laterals in the Marcellus will increase further over time or lateral length kind of remain unchanged but frac spacing will narrow?", "Ray N. Walker", "We have definitely seen horizontal lateral lengths increase over time. And I think it has to do with a lot of different factors in southwest Pennsylvania namely. In northeast Pennsylvania, I think it's a little easier to drill longer laterals. You have much bigger tracts of land and it's easier to put those together. It's dry gas. But in the wet and super-rich area, I don't know, did I tell you guys about the 5 wells that we just brought online? They're pretty darn good for 3,300 feet or so. And this year, I think our target -- we put in there, in the economics, our -- what we expect our average laterals to be this year and going into next year. Right now, we rather than look at, like I've said in previous calls and so forth, rather than look at well-by-well economics, and IPs and such, we're much more interested in the total project and how that -- how we ramp that up with the infrastructure so we keep our transportation costs down and our compression cost down, and we fill up the plant at the right level at the right timing, and we HBP acreage all at the same time. Our teams are getting really good at drilling multiple pads from a single surface -- or multiple units from a single-surface pad and different things like that. So we're getting more and more efficient every quarter, every year that goes by in HBP and acreage, and we're beginning to see that focus more to a development mode-type well. I mean we're still a ways away from that. We still have a lot of infrastructure to build. We still have a lot of that kind of thing to happen. But we -- I would forecast that our lateral lengths probably continue to get a little longer over time. I don't see them getting a lot longer anytime soon. But we -- I mean we have drilled a lot longer laterals and we will drill some and in special cases whether it's a land situation or it's just a science test or the reservoir characteristics are a little bit different, where we think we need to drill longer. But right now, we're pretty happy. I think what we're seeing in the super-rich area, we're just knocking it out of the park there. I'm just overly excited about that. And I'll probably tell you about those 5 wells again before the meeting is over.", "Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "And then my follow-up is just staying in the Marcellus, on how tight a spacing are you drilling in the Marcellus right now and how tight do you think it can go?", "Ray N. Walker", "We, on average, I think in Southwest PA, us and most of the offset operators in that area are pretty much anywhere between 1,500 feet to down to 700 feet between laterals. We typically, when we drill multiple laterals today on a pad, will not generally get closer than 1,000 feet. Now like Jeff said earlier, we have some pilots out there that are 500-foot spacing, which would basically be a 40-acre-type pilot. And those have a couple of years. We haven't released the data on that yet. But I think, today, we're more interested in trying to HBP acreage, while at the same time, building production as efficiently as we can. And like those 5 wells, I told you I'd say that again, those 5 wells, that was 3 wells that's holding a 6 40, and then the other one is 2 wells holding a 6 40. So they're clearly more than 1,000 feet apart. But in general, if we're drilling multi-well situations on a pad, there will be about 1,000 foot today. And I do think that there is significant potential at least in some areas that it's going to go denser than that. And I know EQT and CNX, from time to time, have talked about that also. And so I think there's clearly no question we'll be there. When you look at the Barnett, the granddaddy of all of them, where it all started, I mean there's literally some areas where they're 125 feet apart and they still think there's more gas in play. So who knows where it will eventually go. But the one thing I can say is it they won't be the same everywhere. We sometimes get caught in a trap of thinking the Marcellus is the Marcellus everywhere, and it's considerably different. When you just look at the map of our acres position in the dry and the wet and the super-rich, they're significantly different between those 3 regimes, and even from one edge of one area to the other edge, you see a lot of difference. So I think they'll get longer, but again, we're pretty happy with what we're doing today. So it's pretty exciting.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. And like Ray said, I mean I think, clearly, we're in a core area. There's other core areas. And then at the end of the day, whether you can infill, just comes down to what's the hydrocarbon you're getting out of the wellbore versus hydrocarbon in place. And there are some areas based on that ratio that will support 40 acres. I won't get into all the details. If you want, call us later, and we'll talk about it.", "Let's go to the next question and I believe final question. That was it? Okay. I apologize. I see a lot of other people teed up. So let me say then for all the people that didn't get to ask questions, that we want to make sure we talk to you, make sure to call the IR guys. Our team will be on call. We want to make sure we get to all the people who didn't get a chance to ask questions. And I'll just go with my closing comments then, which is a lot of what I've been saying, is given Range's large high-quality, low-risk acreage position and drilling inventory, we believe that in addition to growing production, 20% to 25% this year, we have 20% to 25% line-of-sight growth for many years. Given the high returns in our liquids-rich and oil plays and assuming current strip pricing, our cash flow is expected to outpace our production growth. We're also projecting that with current strip pricing, we'll be reducing the leverage of our company with time as we drive up production and cash flow. Led by our approximately 1 million net acre position in Pennsylvania, we project that we'll consistently drive up both production and reserves on a per-share basis, debt adjusted for years to come. Plus, we continue to be one of the lowest cost producers in our peer group and are still improving. We believe that this plan will translate into substantial shareholder value in the months and years ahead.

[Operator Instructions]", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney L. Waller", "Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the first quarter of 2013, with record production and a continuing decrease in unit cost. Both earnings and cash flow per share results were greater than First Call consensus.", "The order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After the speakers, we will conduct a question-and-answer period.", "Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on the home page of our website, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margin and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call today.", "Now let me turn it over to Jeff for his opening remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you, Rodney. We're off to a great start in 2013. We continued making progress with our plan of driving up production and reserves on a per-share basis while driving down cost. Production was up 34% versus the first quarter of last year. Total unit costs were down 10% versus the prior year, with LOE leading the way, down 23% from last year. DD&A dropped from $1.68 per Mcfe to $1.46 per Mcfe. Importantly, our operational successes are beginning to significantly flow through to our financial results. Despite prices being down 3%, our cash flow increased 34% year-over-year from $163 million to $219 million.", "Looking further into 2013, growing production, coupled with improving well results, which Ray will discuss shortly, and lower per unit operating expenses for the entire year should result in substantial increases in Range's cash flow for the year.  In addition to the operational success, we also had 2 other key accomplishments in the first quarter. We sold our New Mexico assets plus Powell Ranch for $275 million. We also issued $750 million of 5% senior subordinated 10-year notes. Both transactions allow us to continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet.", "As we previously announced, we're expecting production to grow at a rate of 20% to 25% for 2013. More importantly, we believe that we have line-of-sight growth of 20% to 25% for many years. All of this projected growth is on our existing plays. The reinvestment risk is low, and the projected rates of return are very good.", "The growth is mostly driven by our approximate 1 million net acre land position in Pennsylvania, specifically by low-risk, high-return drilling in the Marcellus Shale. In addition to the Marcellus Shale, we're projecting impactful growth from the Horizontal Mississippian, Upper Devonian, Utica, Cline and Wolfberry plays. Given the high return of our plays, which is led by our liquids-rich and oil plays, our cash flow should grow at a faster rate each year than our production growth of 20% to 25% per year. With our projections, using current strip pricing, we expect to reduce our leverage with time, even with a slight outspend as we drive up production and cash flow.", "Let me take a few minutes and reflect on U.S. E&P business in general today. With successful application of horizontal drilling, coupled with multiple-stage hydraulic fracturing, the industry has unlocked large-scale, repeatable oil and gas plays and shale formations across the country, such as the Marcellus, Eagle Ford and Bakken. In addition, this technology is being applied to old areas that have a rich hydrocarbon charge and a lot of hydrocarbon left to recover, like the Permian basin. The key to being a top-tier oil and gas company is to have a large position in the core area of one of the top quality plays. Range is clearly one of a handful of companies that meets this criteria. We are blessed by having approximately 1 million net acres in the state of Pennsylvania, which includes a very significant position in the liquids-rich portion of the play. Our position is further differentiated by the fact that in our area, we have not only the Marcellus, but we believe we have great stack pay potential in the Upper Devonian and Utica. Plus, where a play is located is also very important from a marketing point of view. Our discovery, the Marcellus, is well located in the northeast portion of the United States.", "Gas from the Marcellus will not only supply the northeast United States, but gas from the Marcellus will move into the Midwest and Southeast markets. It's also strategically located relative to existing pipeline infrastructure, as well as the export facilities and harbor, in the Philadelphia area.  It's this position that gives us the confidence to project 20% to 25% growth for many years.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.", "Ray N. Walker", "Thanks, Jeff. On the operations front, the synopsis is all about executing the plan with better efficiencies, lower operating cost and improving well performance in what we all now recognize as one of the highest-quality plays in North America. With continued strong execution in our approximately 1 million net acre position in Pennsylvania, combined with our stack pay potential in the Utica and Upper Devonian, our emerging plays in the Mississippian, the Cline and the Wolfberry, we believe we can drive increasing value for our stockholders for many years into the future.", "Let me start with and spend most of my time this morning on the Marcellus. We continue to recognize substantial improvements in well performance that we believe will lead to real upside in our plan. These improvements are a result of longer laterals, RCS completions, better frac designs and the application of new targeting technology. To illustrate this, during the first quarter, we brought online a 6-well pad in the super-rich area at 14,040 boe per day that's 65% liquids. That's 2,340 boe per day average per well. Additionally, we're bringing online a brand-new 6-well pad as we speak with slightly shorter laterals in the same area that also looks very good at 1,860 boe per day per well with 64% liquids. Now in and of itself, these are impressive wells with great production rates and outstanding economics. The punchline is that these new wells are in an area that already had 8 offset producing wells with up to 5 years of production history, and the new wells are substantially better than the previous wells.", "I want to stress that these 24-hour production rates from each of these 12 wells are actual rates to sales, but yet they're all constrained by limitations of the facilities and gathering system. In spite of being choked back, which is by design, by several metrics, these new wells are simply better than those nearby older wells. In our view, the improvements are because the new wells were targeted better, had 30% longer laterals and had optimized RCS frac designs when compared to the older wells. For the new wells, the gas rate per frac stage is 28% higher for the first 20 days, and the gas rate per equivalent lateral length is 125% higher. Importantly, production per dollar spent is 140% higher than the older wells for those first 20 days. This is really important, so I'm going to repeat it again. The new wells' gas rate per frac stage is 28% higher, and per equivalent lateral length is 125% higher. And the production per dollar spent is 140% higher than the older wells for those first 20 days.", "Clearly, this illustrates the potential upside that we could see going forward as we go back into previously drilled areas. These 12 wells also support our belief that we have not yet drilled our best well in the wet and super-rich Marcellus. As we apply these new designs and technologies along with longer laterals, we expect that our well results will continue to improve. And as was the case in this example, and I'm repeating myself again, we can expect substantial upside going forward, even in areas where we've previously drilled.", "On the last call, we discussed 5 new wells in the super-rich area that also had impressive production rates. As follow-up on those 5 wells, the 3-well pad, after 30 days of production, was producing 1,085 boe per day per well, still at 65% liquids. And the 2-well pad was producing 1,257 boe per day per well, still at 58% liquids. I think the results of these 17 super-rich wells demonstrate the impact of improving well performance and economics as a result of our team continuing to unlock and apply new technologies. In fact, 11 of those 17 wells now have more than 30 days production and, for the first 30 days, are 45% to 50% above the super-rich type curve in our presentation. The key is it's still early, but we are really excited about the long-term potential that, that shows. Our technical team is really taking advantage of our improved reservoir modeling, which can only come with time and more data.", "What we're excited about is the potential upside that we see all across the Marcellus, including in the dry areas. We've been talking about these techniques for quite some time but now are seeing tangible and impressive results and again, recognizing real upside in well performance as we go back into previously drilled areas. Today, we have over 430 horizontal Marcellus wells in Southwest PA on our 540,000 net acre position, which are producing approximately 500 million cubic feet equivalent per day net. If we were to develop the entire position on 80 acres, that's 6,750 wells. Best to-date, we've only drilled about 6% of our wells on 80-acre spacing. If you could drill all 6,750 wells today, when you do the math, we have the potential to grow our Southwest Pennsylvania production to almost 8 bcf equivalent per day. Of course, this is assuming we drill all our acreage on 80s and all the wells are equal and, at the same time, and so on.", "Obviously, I'm not saying we will grow at 8 bcf equivalent per day, but it does give us confidence that we have a very large and high-quality asset that we can grow significantly for many years. Remember, there are over 1,650 producing Marcellus wells, which significantly de-risk our acreage. And again, this estimate does not include the Upper Devonian or the Utica or 40-acre spacing, all of which, we believe, are highly prospective across our Southwest PA acreage.", "If you factor in all the things we're seeing, improving well performance, increasing capital efficiencies and lower operating cost, and you add to that 40-acre development in portions of the reservoir and additionally, you tack on the stack pay potential of the Utica and Upper Devonian and the potential of our other plays across the company, I think you can see for yourself why we have confidence in our ability to grow production at 20% to 25% for many years, essentially doubling our production every 3 years or so, which, in about 6 years, takes us up to 3 bcf equivalent per day as a company. And we believe it continues to grow significantly from there.", "Shifting to Northeast Pennsylvania, while continuing to hold acreage with 1 to 2 rigs running, our technical team is focusing on delivering great wells, reducing cost and increasing efficiency. Two significant wells were brought online in Lycoming County and are described in the press release, and our plan for the remainder of the year is to continue with the 1-to-2-rig program in that area.", "Now I'll bring you up-to-date on our emerging plays and start with our Mississippian play in Northern Oklahoma. We ran 5 rigs during the first quarter. Efficiencies are improving quickly. For example, we've seen our spud-to-rig-release days decrease from 37 days down to approximately 20 days in a short span of just 9 months. We've had some good news on a couple of other fronts. We've gotten a better result from pooling than we predicted, and we're ending up with almost 100% working interest in our wells rather than the prediction of 80% or so. Also, the team is making much better use of our saltwater disposal infrastructure, therefore, not needing to drill as many disposal wells this year. As a result of the rigs getting faster, higher working interest and less saltwater disposal wells needed, the good news is we're going to be able to utilize fewer rigs this year for about the same number of net producing wells. We're still working out the numbers, but we should be able to finish the year with fewer rigs as we do plan to stick to our CapEx budget.", "The team did have some noteworthy wells and updates on previous wells that are detailed in the press release. In this play, it's all about location in a core sweet spot area, execution, controlling cost and steadily and thoughtfully building out infrastructure. And I'm happy to report that the Midcontinent team is doing a great job on all fronts.", "In the wet Utica, Northwest PA and the Cline in West Texas, we're continuing to closely monitor offset activity, along with trading data and results as wells in both areas are completed and brought online by our peers. Again, we have large acreage positions in both areas that are largely HBP, and our plan continues to be to watch, trade and learn before we make any further development plans. Later this year, we expect that there'll be significant information that we can talk about in both plays.", "For the first quarter, we exceeded our production guidance primarily due to some better-than-expected timing of pads coming online, combined with some really good well performance, both of which happened in the Marcellus. Like I was talking about earlier, some of these multi-well pads coming online are really impressive, and just a few days ahead or behind schedule can really impact our production in any given quarter. While we're likely to see quarter-to-quarter variability, we still expect to come right in at 20% to 25% growth for the year. Although we lost approximately 18 million cubic feet equivalent per day from the New Mexico sale that was effective April 1, guidance for the second quarter is set between 880 million and 890 million cubic feet equivalent per day with 20% liquids.", "Remember in the last call, during Q&A, I kept referring to and restating, \"Did I tell you about those 5 super-rich Marcellus wells?\" We had a lot of fun with that, obviously. But there were a few folks on the call that caught the real meaning. It really is the Marcellus and our large acreage position in Pennsylvania that will drive our share price for many years. You could sum it up into 7 key points: number one, the sheer size of our acreage position in Pennsylvania at approximately 1 million net acres; number two, the largely de-risked nature of our Marcellus potential, largely in Southwest and Northeast PA; number three, the stack pay potential of the Utica and the Upper Devonian and the potential of the wet Utica and Northwest PA; number four, the tremendous economic impact of the liquids in our wet and super-rich area in both the Marcellus and the Upper Devonian and the developing markets for those products; number five, the high-quality dry gas assets both in Northeast and Southwest Pennsylvania; number six, capital efficiency improvements as we go back into areas where infrastructure is already in place, combined with the lower unit cost; and number seven, substantial improvements in well performance as we incorporate better RCS designs, better targeting and longer laterals.", "As we begin to appreciate all these things going forward, it really is all about what those 17 super-rich wells illustrate. We've only just begun to get a glimpse of the upside as our technical team continues to accelerate its understanding of the reservoir and delivers results. What it means is as we work our plan for 20% to 25% production growth year-over-year for many years going forward, we have great confidence in our team and our assets. In short, we are confident in our plan to deliver substantial shareholder value for many years to come.", "Now over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny", "Thank you, Ray. The first quarter of 2013 produced continued improvement from last year in most all financial measures, on both the income statement and balance sheet, higher revenue, higher cash flow, with lower unit cost and declining leverage.", "Reflecting first on the balance sheet improvements this quarter, we requested and received unanimous ratification of our existing $2 billion bank credit facility borrowing base and $1.75 billion binding commitment. At quarter end, approximately $1.6 billion of the committed credit facility was unused. Shortly after filing our annual 10-K in February, we issued $750 million in new 10-year, no-call 5 senior subordinated notes at 5% fixed interest. The combination of the new 5% notes, the December 2012 call of our 7.5% notes and pending call of our 7.25% notes reduces the weighted average interest rate on our long-term, fixed-rate debt by 58 basis points. This balance sheet improvement further reduces our interest rate volatility while extending our first bond maturity to 2019, 6 years out.", "On April 1, we closed the sale of our New Mexico assets for approximately $275 million. The sale will produce about $84 million pretax gain in the second quarter, and proceeds from the sale were used to repay debt. Adjusting the first quarter debt to trailing 4 quarter EBITDAX ratio for the asset sale reduces our leverage ratio from 3.2x at year end to 2.8x.", "Moving to the income statement, cash flow for the first quarter was $219 million, 34% higher than the first quarter of last year. Cash flow per fully diluted share for the quarter was $1.36, $0.03 above analyst consensus estimate of $1.33. EBITDAX for the quarter was $259 million, 31% higher than last year. Cash margin was $2.75 an Mcfe for the first quarter. That's 2% higher than last year, even though realized prices were down.", "Earnings calculated using analyst methodology, which were adjusted for certain noncash and nonrecurring items, was $53 million for the first quarter of 2013, more than twice last year's figure of $24 million. On a per-share basis, analyst -- earnings were $0.33 per fully diluted share. That's $0.04 higher than analyst consensus.", "Natural gas futures prices increased between the end of the year and the end of the first quarter. And while this is good news, the gas price increase made our hedges less valuable at the end of this reporting period compared to the end of the last reporting period. And this explains the $97 million noncash mark-to-market loss on our hedges, which was primarily responsible for our GAAP net loss. GAAP net income was further reduced by $42 million in noncash deferred compensation expense. That's due to the fact that our stock price increased from $62.83 per share at year end to $81.04 per share at the end of the first quarter. So even though the shares required to fund the deferred comp obligation have already been issued and placed in the plan, because the shares are held in the Rabbi Trust, GAAP requires that we expense the amount of the value increase.", "Lastly, as discussed in the 10-Q, we recorded a legal contingency of $35 million, which is included in the G&A expense line. The bottom line impact of these items was a GAAP net loss for the quarter of $76 million compared to a loss of $42 million last year. Please remember, as Rodney mentioned, that all non-GAAP numbers I just mentioned are reconciled to GAAP in the IR tables posted to our website and in the press release.", "Running down the first quarter cost performance and guidance figures, cash direct operating expense, including workovers, was $0.37 an Mcfe, $0.11 or 23% below last year's first quarter. Second quarter is expected to be in the $0.38 to $0.40 per Mcfe range. Third-party gathering, compression and transportation expense came in at $0.79 per Mcfe for the quarter, $0.11 higher than last year, due to continued system expansion and a greater percentage of our production coming from those expansion areas. Second quarter expense for this item is expected to run $0.82 to $0.84 an Mcfe.", "Production and ad valorem taxes for the first quarter were $0.14 an Mcfe, and that includes Pennsylvania impact fees of $0.09 per Mcfe based on total company production. In absolute dollar terms, total production taxes for the quarter were $11.4 million, of which the Pennsylvania impact fee was $7.1 million, and non-Pennsylvania production taxes were $4.3 million. Production taxes in the first quarter of last year were significantly higher as last year's first quarter marked the initial implementation of the Pennsylvania impact fee, and that included the $24 million retroactive payment. Second quarter Pennsylvania impact fees are expected to approximate $7 million, and total production taxes per Mcfe should be between $0.15 and $0.16.", "First quarter exploration expense, excluding noncash comp, was $16 million, down 24% from last year's first quarter, with the timing of seismic expenses prompting the reduction. Our seismic budget for 2013 is only slightly below that of 2012, so we anticipate second quarter exploration expense to come in between $18 million and $20 million. As expected, abandonment and impairment of unproved property during the first quarter was $15 million. That's significantly less than last year's figure of $20 million. The second quarter will likely continue to see this expense fall, down in the $15 million to $17 million range.", "Cash G&A expense for the first quarter was down $0.05 below last year at $0.45 an Mcfe. We came in a tick over guidance on this expense due to some nonrecurring expenses associated with the deployment of several hundred new field vehicles, approximately 150 of which, we are proud to say, are fueled by natural gas. The second quarter should see cash G&A expense back down in the $0.40 to $0.42 range.", "First quarter interest expense is $0.54 an Mcfe, which was $0.08 below last year. And while we expect unit interest expense to resume its downward trend later this year, second quarter interest expense is estimated to be in the $0.58 to $0.59 range due to the timing of the new note issuance versus the old note redemption, the asset sale closing and the fact that we replaced some lower-cost, floating-rate bank debt with that higher-cost, fixed-rate debt.", "Our first quarter DD&A rate per Mcfe was $1.46, $0.22 less than the first quarter of last year. As the E&P business is highly capital-intensive, our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense figure is, by far, the largest absolute dollar expense item on the income statement. The significance of a $0.22 reduction on this unit cost in just 1 year provides clear evidence of the improving capital efficiency that both Jeff and Ray mentioned. The DD&A rate per Mcfe is estimated to be in that $1.46 to $1.48 range next quarter.", "Range has continued to add new natural gas and NGL hedges for the next 3 years as we seek to generate greater predictability of cash flow to underpin our capital program. And please refer to our press release and website for the details on our current hedge position.", "In summary, the balance sheet saw a significant improvement in the first quarter, with lower leverage, higher liquidity, lower long-term financing cost and reduced exposure to interest rate and refinancing risk. On the income statement, looking through the mark-to-market accounting losses caused by higher prices for natural gas and higher Range stock price, one can see another solid quarter of production growth and cost control, driving significant double-digit cash flow growth over last year.", "Jeff, back to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "Ray, a couple questions. You talked a lot about the new, I guess, 12 wells or 14 wells in the super-rich area and how they were better than other -- your older wells in the area. A couple questions. You have a little bit longer laterals, maybe some more frac stages, but what were some of the primary drivers behind that performance? And even though you had a little bit longer laterals, you're still in the mid-3,000 range. Is there the opportunity or likelihood that you would continue to expand that lateral link into the 4,000, 4,500-foot level? And if so, what would your expectations be?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, Ron, great question. I think the drivers of that improved performance are really all of those things combined. Better targeting has certainly been significant, and that involves some of the new focused ion beam scanning electron microscope, pictures where they take -- they model some of this rock at the molecular level almost. And what we've seen is being able to use some of these new technologies and really how the technical teams figured out how to apply those, and where we actually placed that lateral in the rock has made significant changes. And these wells, in the 2- and 6-well pads that I've talked about in the super-rich area nearby the 8 previous wells that were -- some of them are up to 5 years old, the difference there is, on average, they're about 30% longer laterals. And when you combine that with the RCS, that's almost twice as many frac stages in the -- basically, on a per-lateral kind of comparison. So really comparing all those or combining all those things together is really what makes that difference. And I like to talk about the fact that this is really a good indication of, I think, what we're seeing going forward and the application of all the technology. And we've gone back, and of course, we're really excited about all this, and we keep going back and looking at these and how they're comparing to our overall averages and our type curves. And like I said, it's really early. But I think it's really key to point out that these wells, on average, are posted between 45% and 50% above the type curve that we've got in our PowerPoint. So that's pretty exciting. It's still early. It's only 30 or 40 days on some of these wells, but we think that that's going to be really key. As far as longer laterals, yes. I mean, I think over time, you're going to see us migrate to that. In these cases, you're somewhat limited because you were going back into units, in some cases, that had already been formed around it on all sides, so you're sort of limited in some of those cases. But remember, these economics are really, really good at the lengths that we're at today. And they're good in the PowerPoint, so you got a, say A plus B equals C, and they're going to be a lot better overall. So we're pretty excited about it. But to answer your question, yes, we are going to be going longer over the next several years, and we are going to continue to refine some of these technologies. We've got some other ideas. The technical team is just doing a wonderful job up in Pittsburgh, so we're really excited about what they're seeing.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And Ray, you might mention, when you go back into some of those units and drill some of the efficiencies, you think we might see going...", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes. Yes, and that's another good add that we're seeing, too. When you go back into these areas, these new -- whether it's a new pad in that area, it won't have to pay as much money for water impoundments, for instance, because it will use an impoundment that's already there. If we're going back and adding a well on a pad that already exists and say we want to drill a couple of more wells there to go kind of backfill the infrastructure, in a lot of cases, they don't have to pay a lot of money for new infrastructure. They don't have to pay for new pad construction or new roads and that sort of thing. So we could see several hundred thousand dollars less on the upfront cost, which is also really significant going forward. And I think all of those things just continue to enhance our story and what really translates down to shareholder value going forward.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess, a corollary to that, and then I'll let someone else jump on. Is there anything special about this particular area where you drilled these wells within the footprint of older wells, or would you expect similar-type results as you enter other older areas? And then you mentioned, I don't know if it was you or Jeff, in passing, a little bit the 80-acre spacing, but you mentioned the potential for 40-acre spacing. Do you think that's going to be prevalent across most of your acreage in Southwest and Northeast PA?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, we've got at least a couple. I think there may be 3 40-acre pilots that are out there, and some of them have well over 2 years of production now. We have not released any data and don't really plan to anytime real soon. But I'll tell you they're all encouraging at this point. And just from a pure standpoint of doing this kind of thing for a whole lot of years, a lot of us would tell you that there's no doubt as you're in these liquids-rich areas that you're probably going to go to denser spacing over time. So I think that's -- the answer is technically yes. I think a good portion of the wet and super-rich area will probably develop on 40s eventually. But we see that much further down the road. We've still got a lot of room to go back in and infill the rest of the 80s, 60s, whatever combination of lateral lengths and distance between laterals that we come up with over time. So to answer your question, yes, we will be down-spacing significantly going forward.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I think another key thing to say there, too, is on -- if you look at our website and we go through it on our pitch book, what Ray referred to earlier, we got 1 million net acres in the state of Pennsylvania, highly prospective for multiple horizons. And you just zoom in on the 540,000 acres in the Southwest, which Ray did in his example. There's 1,650 wells there, up to 7 years' worth of history on our discovery well, which kicked the whole play off. And we go through in detail on our website, starting on Page 12, 13 and so on, and we break out all the dry, the wet and the super-rich. And really, there's over 1,650 wells that have delineated it, and that acreage is really all high-quality. So we think it's all very prospective, very low-risk, a lot of -- it's a big data set. It's not 7-day rates or 30 or 60. It's up to 7 years' worth of history on over 1,650 wells. So on 80-acre spacing, since we think it's all prospective, potentially 6,750 wells, and like Ray said, we've drilled only about 6% of that on 80s. But it's all highly de-risked with high returns. So we've got a lot of drilling. And the good news, there's data all over the place out there. So we think those techniques that Ray described will be very applicable, really, across that acreage.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes. And just another final word, just so Jeff doesn't get the final word, if you look at the 20 super-rich wells that we turned on in the first quarter, those wells averaged about 65% liquids and the IP on those and boe per day is not a lot different than these wells I've been pointing out here. So I think the hints are, yes, we do expect to see those kind of results. We're pretty excited about this. This is a big deal.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "And Ray, was there any difference about this particular area of going in amongst the older wells or\u2026", "Ray N. Walker", "No. Not appreciably, no.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Real quickly, when you think about the placement of those laterals in the Southwest Marcellus, is that something that you can apply that same technology across your portfolio? And should we be looking to you guys doing that across all the Marcellus and maybe even testing some of that down in the Miss Lime and potentially seeing an uptick from EURs across the board?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, the answer is yes. I mean, we are looking at this everywhere we're working, in the Cline. We're looking at applications in every single play. I think what we tried so far, we've seen varying levels of improvements. And I think it's going to vary a lot based on reservoir rock conditions. And I think the jury is still out because we've only really been applying this last part of last year and early this year, and so it's going to take some time. But I think all our experts would tell you yes, we do expect to see some improvements. But at the same time, we're going to also be doing longer laterals in general everywhere, and we're also doing the RCS-type completions in a lot of cases, too. So it's really going to be a combination of all those things, not just the targeting by itself. But I do expect that we'll try all of those things in pretty much every play.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Okay, appreciate that. And then looking at the Miss Lime just for a second, you put up a couple wells that were very, very strong in your release. EURs look good, but the EURs would generally based off those IPs that you shared with us on the new wells, showed that there's some decent variability between the wells. Maybe I'm misinterpreting that, but looking in other parts of the Miss, different geographies, that's certainly the case. What are you doing to kind of think through or try to avoid having that sort of statistical aberration between all the wells?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, the chat, which is really what we're playing on the Nemaha Ridge, is very variable. It's probably not good grammar. But it varies in thickness, and it varies in the fact that it's -- it's not everywhere. It's very prevalent. It's much more prevalent on the uplift than it is other places. But what we're trying to do with more and more time is trying to determine where that is. We're using our 3D. We've got 4,500 historical wells in that area. And one of the original ideas in putting that lease position together was to really stay close to the historical oil production and try to be around the better historical vertical production because your horizontal results are always going to be a multiple of your vertical. So the best place to look is where the best wells were. So we've got a lot of well log history and different things. And the chat play is really a conventional-type play, for lack of a better description, which is sort of unconventional in today's world. But it has high porosity. It has high permeability, there's lots of fractures. And it's going to be -- I think the standard deviation of results is going to be larger in a play like that. It has to be. So the key is determining why the good wells are good and trying to find more of those as we go, and that's going only going to come with time. Just like we've seen in the Marcellus, with more time, more data and more modeling and more understanding of all of these different rock properties, that's the same thing that we're going to go through in the Mississippi. And we're really early. We'll continue to update the type curves as we get more production at wells throughout the year. But so far, we're really excited with what we see, and it's holding on. And it's going to be a good emerging play, we think. But again, it's still early.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. I think the other thing, there's variability, but I think at the end of the day, the key is what's the average of the program. So if you look at the average of our -- on Slide 26 on our website, if you look at the average of our 2009 to 2011 horizontal wells, they're 485,000 boes type curves or the 0 time plots here in the back. With the costs where we think we are or where we're close to, those generated, strip pricing, 91% rate of return. So really, the average is the key. Granted there's variability, really, in all plays, if you look at the average of the 2012 program at 600,000 boes, and it's over 100% rate of return. But we're learning. Just like we did in the Marcellus, we got progressively better with time. We learn with time. We'll see as we drill forward here how it eventually drills out. And you don't know until you drill it and you get long-term history. But looking at the old historical wells and looking at the 3D and the data that we have, personally, I don't think we've drilled our best areas yet even. We've started around where we started our development in Tonkawa field, and we just expanded around that. Again, I'm very happy with the 2009 through '11 program and 2012, and we'll see what it looks like going forward. But there's -- we still think it's a very attractive play. Nothing -- because we have 1 million net acres in Pennsylvania and you got stack pay potential, that's what's going to drive the 20% to 25% line-of-sight growth for many years. Again, and there's -- if you look at the whole Marcellus play, there's over 7,000 wells and up to 7 years history that have de-risked it, so that's the driver. But the Mississippian is exciting. Our potential in the Upper Devonian, the Utica, the Cline, and those other -- Wolfberry, all those other plays have value, too.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Great, I appreciate that. One last question just in the Miss. When you talk about your time to drill those specific wells and we look at kind of the initial plan to ramp to 7 rigs, then 10, then 15, it would seem like also, with the increased working interest in wells, you really don't need to ramp rigs even materially over the next 2 years to be able to drill your objective of wells. Is that a fair way to think about that? Am I overstepping in terms of -- you're throwing out 20 days to drill a well and trying to work through that math, or how should we think about that as we model stuff out?", "Ray N. Walker", "No, Dave, I think you've nailed it. I mean, we just need to quit talking about rig counts because the drillers are just getting too good too fast. And just like we saw in the Marcellus, we had to quit talking about rig count, and it's really the number of net wells we're going to put online each year. And our plan is still to ramp up activity, but you may not see it near as much in rig counts going forward as we thought earlier on because just in 9 months, they went from almost in half. And we've seen wells 16 days or less, and I predict they'll be a lot less than that a few months from now. So you're exactly right. I think rig count is going to be really difficult to model. We can't even do it internally any more. It's just too \u2013 they're changing too fast.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Scialla with Stifel.", "Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I got on your call late. I seem to be challenged by understanding time zones, so I apologize if you addressed any of these in your prepared remarks, but I missed them. Some people are worried about future condensate prices in certain parts of the country, and it looks like your Marcellus condensate prices, at least as a percentage of WTI, have increased each of the last 3 years. Just wanted to see if you could talk about how you see the market dynamics of the condensate market going forward in your areas?", "Rodney L. Waller", "Well, this is Rodney. And one of the things that we're blessed about is being where we are in the Appalachian area, you're in a very high-demand area, from White Plains down to Baltimore. Canada has brought a lot of imports of C5s and condensates as part of the development there. What you've seen on the slide that we have in the presentation...", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Slide 36. It's out there if you're looking.", "Rodney L. Waller", "Yes, Slide 36. Is that as we get to larger and larger volumes and we have the economies of scale, it allows us to go to different markets than what we are otherwise able to go to. And usually, those are premium markets. So we think there's still upside in the condensate market in Appalachia. There's always the ability to stabilize condensates and have them to qualify for export if that is required. So we think gasoline blending is another potential use that we haven't tapped into yet. So we think there's still growing and expanding markets. And the blessing that we have here is any demand that you have in Appalachia, if it has to be sourced, would have to be sourced from the Gulf of Mexico, which is going to add a huge amount of transportation cost. So we have some built-in margins in every one of our products, whether it's NGLs, condensates, propanes, we have this built-in differential because the only other way to get it is to buy it from Mont Belvieu, which is going to cost you money. And so we're just basically totally disconnected from the Gulf and the challenges that are going on there with all the NGL markets and the condensate market.", "Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So condensate prices could weaken in the Gulf and you wouldn't be impacted by that?", "Rodney L. Waller", "We can't set the index, but we can have alternative export and other alternatives that could stabilize prices much better than any wells in the United States.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And that's why going back again to that Slide 36 or whatever, our prices have just been climbing with time. And we're in a great position not only for condensate but to move gas. And that position, particularly in the Southwest, is right on top of a lot of historic infrastructure that we're able to move gas in a number of directions. We're close, again, to the harbors in the Philadelphia -- harbor in the Philadelphia area to be able to -- and we got our ethane export agreement in place. We're currently exporting propane. So it's not only finding a large field and then having a million-acre footprint in the state and then being in some of the core areas, but also, all the advantage of having that infrastructure there is really critical, coupled with the team.", "Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then on your NGL price, I guess 37% of WTI for the first quarter, would you expect that to come down some in the second half once Mariner West goes into service?", "Roger S. Manny", "For NGL -- yes, when you put the ethane into the NGL, that will come down because what you're adding to the NGL barrel is the lowest dollar value of the total barrel, but production will go up. And so yes, that will happen over time. So be able to do that will help develop for you by next quarter how those fit into it. But with 5,000 barrels, you're not moving it that dramatic this second half of 2013. In 2014 and '15, obviously, there will be big changes in those because you would have much greater values. But also remember, the ethane that we're going to be selling in the second half of 2013 is going to be at a higher price than probably anybody else in the United States. Again, Appalachia's totally differentiating itself as to what we're trying to do with multiple markets that we can serve.", "Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So maybe some modest percentage decline in that percent of WTI but nothing material for second half of '13.", "Rodney L. Waller", "Yes, we can help you model that, Mike.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, and to think about it in aggregate, when you look at that contract with Mariner West, it's at a gas index, so we're actually kept whole as a company plus a little bit with the efficiencies that come. So it's an economic uplift for us in general when you consider everything, as is Mariner East as well.", "Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes. And then you mentioned that you're watching offset operators in some of your emerging areas like the Cline, the Utica and Upper Devonian. I don't know if you mentioned this in your prepared remarks, but anything new there that has made you more or less encouraged by any of those plays?", "Ray N. Walker", "This is Ray, Mike. In the Cline, we're continuing to see a bunch of activity. We still think there's going to be about 50 wells completed and put online in that area this year. We are seeing some good wells pop up here and there, close to 1,000 barrel a day IP type things, on both sides of this, east and west. So we're really almost a donut hole in the activity there. We got a people all around us, north, south, east and west, and so we're really watching that closely. And then in the Northwest Utica, certainly, there's a lot of guys that are really active up there, Halcon, Seneca, Shell, quite a few, Hilcorp. I mean, there's some -- there's going to be -- we still think about a dozen wells up there that year, and actually, Halcon at IPAA last week or so was talking about a couple wells that they're beginning to start flowbacks on. So I think we'll have quite a bit of data over the next couple of quarters that we can start talking about.", "Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. If you are more encouraged by any of that data, any chance you'd allocate some capital toward those plays this year, or is it more likely a 2014 event?", "Ray N. Walker", "I think it's more than likely a 2014 event. We'll need to see some of the stuff, some production history, and it'll take a while to digest that. And then it'll go into the mix when we put together the budget for '14. And I suspect that's the earliest it would happen.", "Michael S. Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one last one for me. You had mentioned that you've had some 40-acre space pilots in the Marcellus on for a couple years. Any reason for holding back the data there? Is it competitive reasons, or is there some unitization issues or something that would impact how you would go about saving the acreage?", "Ray N. Walker", "No, there's no particular reason for holding it back other than -- I think the best way to describe it, and hopefully, nobody shoots me for saying this, is we just don't want -- we don't want to think about it too much yet because we think -- going back into drilling, actually, drilling on 40 acres is down the road somewhere. And I think we've got a lot of going back into areas to finish up the 80s, and we've got a lot of that kind of work to do before we get to that point. So I think you're just not going to see any for a while, but it is encouraging data. And I think we will come out at some point.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. Let me talk about that a little bit because I think it's a key point. Like Ray said, again, going back to 14 on our slide deck, just in the Southwest, we've drilled about 6% of our wells. So we've got a lot of drilling to do on 80s because we think that whole area is prospective, and of course, on 40s. And we think a lot of it is prospective for 40s. I think there's a couple of key thoughts that come out of that. One, again, that's what gives us confidence to say we think we can drill at 20% to 25% for many years. So again, if we can -- and if you're growing at that rate on a compounded basis, roughly, every 3 years, you're doubling. So take, and I always roll back to around year end, around 0.8 Bs net, round it down, 3 years out, around 1.6 Bs net and going to around 3 Bs per day net, which would be phenomenal. That's why we think we can do that. I think the other key thing to think about with the down-spacing is, when you look at all the numbers we have for resource potential in aggregate for the Marcellus, is the recovery factors in that 30%, low 30% of gas in place or hydrocarbon in place, liquids in place. Through a combination of what Ray discussed, which is better quality wells going forward, through a combination of RCS, better landing, a little longer laterals, a few more stages, we can really drive up recoveries from our wells. The other way we can drive it up is through drilling the wells closer together, instead of 1,000-foot apart like we're drilling now 500 feet apart, which some other operators are already doing. So when you look at those 2 things combined, do we think we have the potential to take our recovery factor in the better areas from 30% roughly to maybe 50%, 55%, maybe even double it on the high side? That potential exists. So if you take some from 30% to 50% but you got the giant acreage positions we have, that's a lot of value. That's a lot of NAV. That's a lot of stuff that gives us confidence that we can grow consistently at 20% to 25% per year. That, to me, is the real significance of it. And it's not just growth, but it's higher-quality growth for all the reasons that Ray said earlier, those first wells again, or back in earlier this year, performing. And it's early, and it's just a handful of wells, but they're 45% over our type curve for the super-rich area. That's really impactful in terms of modeling and NAV and value creation.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I wanted to go back to the commentary in the release about the extent of which continuing to hold acreage by production is limiting your ability to really go after some of these wells. So I'm just wondering if you can give us an update as to where are we in that process and at what point would you feel comfortable revising higher because it looks like we're heading out where the type curves on some of the super-rich results you've announced last night.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, I think if you flip to Slide 12 on our website or in our pitch book, it shows where our approximately 1 million net acres are, and then for each one of those areas, it shows a percent HBP. So the main area, we have the HBP is in the Southwest. And which predominantly, a lot of the dry stuff, most of it, a lot of it, is HBP. So it's predominantly in the wet and super-rich. So for the well designs we have been drilling, and again, you can look at them, like Ray mentioned earlier, they're really high returns, whether you look at rate of return, return on investment, PVI or whatever you want to look at. So we got really high returns doing what we're doing. The exciting part, though, is they can get better. So what we've done is sort of artificially constrained ourself over the last few years because we're in a different position than really I think when you look at it on a net acreage basis in Pennsylvania, I think Range probably is number one . So we have the largest position in the highest-quality, largest gas field out there, plus we have a position in the wet part of it, as well as really high-quality dry acreage. So we're trying to hold acreage, as well as drive up production per share, reserves per share and cash flow per share. Having done that, we constrained our wells to things that are probably less than optimum, still generating really high rate of returns. So going forward, as we hold more and more acreage, what you've seen every single year, back from when we first started releasing the 0 time plots, is every single year, as we have migrated towards all those more optimum completion techniques, our reserves per well have gone up, including -- if you go back even a year ago, we were at 5.9 Bs in the wet. So in the Southwest this year, we're at 8.7. Of course, there's a giant liquids component to that. So they're going up every year. Will I expect that they'll stop going forward? No. I would expect that they'll get better as they go forward as we continue to do all those things. We've done it every year in the past, and we're continuing to do things that we know will work based on what we've done and based on what others are doing. So it's balancing and trying to capture that opportunity. Again, going back to Page 14, we've drilled on 80-acre spacing, 6% of our wells. If you use 40, it's 3%. Did we optimize the first 3% to 6% of our wells? No. But we've generated, I think, some really good returns and really good performance. And for the remaining 90-plus percent, I think they're going to get better and better.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes. Another thing, I'll just tag on a little tidbit, one of the measures that we often look at is recovery per 1,000-foot of lateral. And a few years ago, we were in that 2 bcf per 1,000 foot of lateral in kind of in the wet area per se. Last -- in these type curves we've got today, we're in that 2.7 range, in that same area, so that's a really large percentage increase in the recoveries per 1,000 foot of lateral length. And so just as important as increasing the lateral length is the more you get per 1,000 foot of lateral. And clearly, these new wells that we were talking about earlier in my remarks, the 2 new 6-well pads plus the 5 wells from the previous call, look like they could be 45% to 50%. I mean, they are for the first 30 days, 45% to 50% above the type curve that we have in the book. So we're seeing major improvements in recoveries per 1,000 foot of lateral and at the same time, going longer laterals. So we all totally agree that these wells are going to get better as we go and our ability to drain the rock is going to get a lot better as we go.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "All right, guys. Maybe just sort of a clarification. Jeff, when did you expect to be done with the bulk of the HBP process on the current line?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, okay, let's flip back. When you go to the Northeast, there, we have on Slide 12, 145,000 net acres, 69% HBP. The key thing is at this point in time, although we're not in HBP mode there, we're in a continuous drilling mode. So we just need to run 1 to 2 rigs per year, and we'll hold all the acreage that we want to hold there, the high-quality acreage. If you go to Southwest, that 51% probably goes up roughly 10% to 15% per year.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will go to Marshall Carver [ph] of Heikkinen Energy Advisors for our final question.", "Unknown Analyst", "In terms of the 20% to 25% growth per year over the next few years, does that cook in any of this improved well performance that you're seeing, or is that based on the current well performance or even the well performance that you were seeing in late 2012? Could you give me some clarity around that 20% to 25% growth?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes. Well, first, I want to correct. It's not for just a few years we're going to grow 20% to 25%. It's many years. But yes, some of that is built in there in the type curves that we updated first part of this year. So yes, there is some of that. But clearly, what we're seeing in some of these recent wells is, like I've been saying, 45%, 50% above that already. Now it's still early, and it's hard to put an EUR on the well with only 30 days of production. And they're somewhat choked back and constrained by design and...", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "None of that's baked into it.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, none of that's baked into it at all, and certainly, none of it's baked into it in the dry areas and the other plays, which we -- that's just  one more thing that gives us confidence in the ability to grow it at 20% to 25% for so many years going out there. It's just a really high-quality portfolio of assets.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "If you're modeling it going forward, we're comfortable with the 20% to 25%. That's why we've been saying it consistently. If you're going to model that because our wells have improved every single year since we've been in the play, I wouldn't model it flat going forward. I think the proper way to model it would be to build some of that in there. In fact, I've built a lot of it in there.", "Ray N. Walker", "Bigger and [indiscernible].", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, and what I'm saying is we'll grow at 20% to 25%. But the quality of the wells and the returns on the investment will get better with time as you build that in there.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, absolutely.", "Operator", "This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "In closing, I'd like to make 3 points. One, given Range's large, high-quality, low-risk acreage position and drilling inventory, we believe that in addition to growing production 20% to 25% this year, we have 20% to 25% line-of-sight growth for many years. Secondly, given the high returns in our liquids-rich and oil plays and assuming current strip pricing, our cash flow is expected to outpace our production growth. We're also projecting that with current strip pricing, we'll be reducing the leverage of our company with time as we drive up production and cash flow. The third point is that we expect our well results to continue to get better with time as we have demonstrated over the past years.", "Having drilled only a small fraction of the wells that we ultimately expect to drill in the Marcellus, as we refine our targeting of our laterals, drill longer laterals and optimize our completions with RCS and additional stages, we're convinced that we have not drilled our best wells yet. Led by our approximately 1 million net acre position in Pennsylvania, we project that we'll consistently drive up both production and reserves on a per-share basis, debt-adjusted, for years to come. Plus we continue to be one of the lowest-cost producers in our peer group and are still improving. We believe that this plan will translate into substantial shareholder value in the months and years ahead.", "I know that there's several other people that were queued up for Q&A. Please give our IR team a call, and we'll try to handle all those questions as fast and as best as we can. And thanks to everyone for participating on the call.", "Operator", "Thank you.

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney L. Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the second quarter of 2013, with record production and continuing decrease in unit cost. Both earnings and cash flow per share results were greater than first call consensus. The order of our speakers on the call of the day are: Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Also, Mr. Pinkerton, our Executive Chairman is on the call today. [Operator Instructions]", "Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on the home page of our website or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we have posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call.", "Now let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you, Rodney. With our existing portfolio of properties, we believe that we can grow our overall production at a rate of 20% to 25% per year for many years. As the largest acreage position in our company, Range has approximately 1 million net acres in Pennsylvania as the engine that will drive our growth. We have both the assets necessary to grow our production and a proven team in place to carry out our plan. In addition, we believe that we've lined up the critical processing and takeaway capacity for the next several years.", "On the liquid side of our business in Pennsylvania, we have entered into 3 agreements to transport and sell ethane. The first project, Mariner West, commenced line fill on July 21. Since our sales point is FOB to MarkWest Houston plant, line fill to Range equals sales. The Mariner West project is significant in that the de-ethanizer at the MarkWest Houston plant in Washington County Pennsylvania is currently the only operating de-ethanizer in the Appalachian basin. This project is very important for Range in 2 regards: First, with the vast majority of our wet Marcellus gas being processed at the Houston plant, coupled with our dry Marcellus gas production elsewhere, 95% of our Marcellus production will meet pipeline specs, a key factor in ensuring that Range's gas will continue to flow. The remaining 5% of our Marcellus production flows to the MarkWest Majorsville plant in West Virginia, where de-ethanizers are expected to be in place and running in 6 to 9 months. If there are issues in the interim, Range has the ability to redirect the majority of the 5% of the gas that flows to Majorsville.", "The second thing that Mariner West project does is allows us to continue to grow and build our overall production volumes. Mariner West, combined with ATEX, which is projected to come online next year and Mariner East, which is expected to come online with the ethane portion of the project in 2015, will enable Range to sell 55,000 barrels of ethane per day. Assuming minimum ethane extraction, this level of ethane sales will enable us to produce 1.8 Bcf per day of wet natural gas into the processing plants. When this wet gas volume is processed, and the gas is shrunk and the natural gas liquids and condensate are added to it, we are projecting that these 3 projects will enable Range to produce about 2.2 Bcfe per day net from just the wet and super-rich portions of our acreage.", "Adding in the dry gas, we have the potential to exceed 3 Bcfe per day net. Bear with me for a couple of minutes and I'll quickly walk through the math. With these 3 projects, we have the capacity to produce 55,000 of ethane, barrels of ethane per day. Assuming minimum ethane recovery, this equates to 1.8 Bcf per day of wet gas into the processing plant. In addition to the 55,000 barrels of ethane, natural gas liquids and condensate could potentially total an additional 140,000 barrels per day. Total liquids production potentially could then be about 195,000 barrels per day. We're using a 6:1 conversion, 1.2 Bcfe per day net -- or Bcfe per day. After the liquids are removed from the 1.8 Bcf per day of gross inlet gas, the gas volume would shrink the 1.4 Bcf per day. Adding the 1.4 Bcf per day of natural gas to the 1.2 Bcfe per day of natural gas liquids and condensate equals 2.6 Bcfe per day gross, or about 2.2 Bcfe per day net. That's from the wet and super-rich portions of the Marcellus. If you add in the dry gas potential, we have the potential to exceed 3 Bcf per day from the Marcellus alone, with the 3 ethane projects we already have under contract. This is a key element which gives us the confidence a project 20% to 25% growth for many years.", "On a compounded basis, growing at 20% to 25% per year equates to doubling production roughly every 3 to 4 years. In addition to having the projects in place to extract, transport and sell the liquids, we have secured enough firm transportation and firm sales to handle our projected gas sales for several years.", "In 2014, we have firm capacity in term sales for over 80% of our production. Our team has been working on these projects for many years, and is putting the pieces in place so that we can continue to grow production profitably beyond our current arrangements.", "On the operations side, we just updated our results and provided our expectations for the future drilling in Southwest Pennsylvania of our super-rich wet and dry wells on an EUR per thousand foot of lateral basis. In addition, we've updated all of our projected reserves and economics for these areas based on our updated well designs. Well designs range from 4,200 feet to 5,000-foot laterals, with over 20 frac stages per well. The average projected recovery for these wells ranges from 10.9 to 12.3 Bcfe per well.", "As shown on Slide 23 of our investor presentation on our website, under current strip pricing, the rate of return for the dry, wet and super-rich projects are all about 100% pretax rate of return. Reinvestment risk in all 3 areas is low, and economics for all 3 areas are high. Therefore, our plans are to drill and develop all 3 areas.", "We also just released the results of our 500-foot tighter spacing project in the Marcellus. Based on 3 years of history, the project is very encouraging, and we're projecting that our 500-foot space wells will recover about 80% of 1,000-foot space well. That both increases our resource potential and provides us additional confidence that we can grow at 20% to 25% for many years with high returns, low cost and low reinvestment risk.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations in more detail.", "Ray N. Walker", "Thanks, Jeff. My remarks today will primarily focus on the Marcellus in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Our technical teams continue to make great strides applying newer technologies and approaches such as RCS, enhanced completion designs, longer laterals and better targeting. We've updated and provided guidance for our development plans for all 3 areas, dry, wet and super-rich, as well as adding some new data. There's been a lot of discussion lately concerning well performance on a normalized lateral length basis, so we've included actual performance data on a per thousand foot of lateral length basis for all 3 areas in Southwest PA, as we believe we have some of the best performance data in the basin. Wellhead economics returns in Southwest PA of strip processing in all 3 areas are now approximately 100%. The bottom line, all 3 areas are high-quality assets, and like our philosophy has always been, it's really about economic returns at Range.", "Our ability to achieve those high returns in dry gas drilling, wet gas drilling and drilling in the super-rich area allows us to confidently grow our production at 20% to 25% year-over-year for many years. Let's start with the super-rich area.", "We've now added Slide #14 in our presentation showing the actual production data of the 17 wells that we've discussed in the last couple of calls, as compared to the average production curve of our pre-2013 results. It's early, but the actual production data shows that these 17 wells are producing to sales 50% better than the pre-2013 curve, with over 4 months of production history. Again, this is not based on just a forecast, it's actual production data to sales and we are very encouraged by what we see so far.", "Also on the super-rich area, in early July, we brought online a new well that produced 3,670 BOE per day at 72% liquids, while choked back due to gathering system limitations. That rate included over 1,000 barrels per day of condensate. Just 2 weeks ago, it was the highest 24-hour maximum rate to date at any well in the Marcellus with more than 50% liquids. However, I'm happy to report that, that record did not last very long. Last week, we brought online another well approximately 10 miles away at 5,720 BOE per day with 63% liquids, which 24% of those liquids was condensate. This well is now the highest rate IP liquids well with more than 50% liquids, not only in the Marcellus, but in the entire basin, in the modern era that we're aware of. Again, these are only IPs, and it's still very early but we believe we are seeing some real upside potential as we implement these new well designs.", "I'm going to pause for just a second here and offer my congratulations to the Southern Marcellus Shale division team for the great results. And just like the team in Pittsburgh, I don't believe we've drilled our best well yet.", "On Slides 15 and 16, you can see our updated cost, EURs and economics for the super-rich area. You can also see our well performance on an EUR per thousand foot of lateral basis. We steadily increased lateral length and the number of stages while combining that with better targeting and completion science. We are now and into 2014 drilling 20% longer laterals and completing them with 50% more stages. All of this yielding better and better EURs, higher efficiencies, lower unit cost and the resulting economics that you see in our presentation. And we still believe there's substantial upside as we get more and more of these wells under our belt.", "In the wet area, we also continue to see improving well performance for all the same reasons. Going forward, we plan to drill, on average, 4,200-foot laterals and complete with 21 stages. We project these wells to have an EUR of 12.3 Bcf equivalent, which is a 41% increase from our last projection. We've also included in this analysis for this area an EUR per thousand foot of lateral basis comparison. Again, we've seen improvement year-over-year, and we believe we have some of the best wells in the basin that are on an EUR per thousand foot basis, are nearly 3 Bcf equivalent per 1,000 feet of lateral length. We brought online 15 wells in the wet area this year, with an average IP of 13.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day with 38% liquids. Those wells were mostly drilled in 2012, and averaged 2,627-foot laterals with 14 stages. It used to be that a single well IP of 13.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day was a real game changer. But let me point out that today's game changers that this is a 15 well average from only 2,627-foot laterals that we drilled back in 2012. Although these are really impressive completions to date, especially if you look at them on a normalized per 1,000 feet of lateral length basis, we are now drilling longer laterals with RCS completions and expect bigger EURs and no returns.", "In the dry area of Southwest PA, we brought online 16 wells so far this year, averaging 2,942-foot laterals with 15 stages. Again, those wells were either permitted or drilled back in 2012. But if you look at Slide #21 in our presentation, you can see that these wells, on a lateral length basis are almost 2.5 Bcf equivalent per thousand foot of lateral, and are already some of the best-performing wells in Southwest PA. Going forward, we're drilling wells in this area with an average lateral length of 5,000 feet, and completing them with 25 stages. We expect those wells to have an EUR of 12.2 Bcf, which is 2.44 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral, and we expect them to cost approximately $6 million.", "At today's strip pricing, these wells would yield a return of 97% and an NPV 10 of $12.7 million. It's important to point out with these newer designs, these wells now compete favorably with our super-rich and wet area economics.", "If you look at Slide #23 on the website, you'll see the real punchline. We've presented a side-by-side comparison of all 3 areas in Southwest PA. Economic returns in all 3 areas are approximately 100%, with EURs ranging from 10.9 up to 12.3 Bcf equivalent. Again, it's all about returns and cash flow at Range, and we believe this demonstrates the high-quality, low reinvestment risk and the diversity, along with the balance of our portfolio of projects.", "Okay, shifting to Oklahoma. For the Horizontal Mississippian play, we've become more aggressive with the frac designs, primarily going back to the larger frac jobs which are yielding really good results. There's 3 recent wells listed in the press release with these larger volume fracs with IPs ranging from 957 to 1,306 BOE per day, and oil production rates from 230 up to 625 barrels of oil per day. All 3 of these wells are in line with or above our expectations. Going forward, on average, we still expect to be right in line with our expectations of EURs ranging from 485 to 600 MBOE per well.", "I'll shift now to the other divisions across the company. In Nora, our last 4 horizontal Huron Shale wells have been the best-performing wells to date, so congratulations to Jerry and the team. They've implemented some new well designs and completions that appeared to be working really well. For Northeast PA and the other areas across the company, you can refer to our earnings release for updates on the activity in those areas, and we can certainly cover any of those areas during Q&A.", "Production for the third quarter will be set at 945 million to 950 million cubic feet equivalent per day, with approximately 22% of that production being liquids. We've had great success during the first half of 2013, and we're on track for the year to approach the high end of our previously announced range of 20% to 25% year-over-year production growth.", "In summary, our technical and operations teams all across the company are doing a great job, working safely, being a good stewards of the environment and good citizens of the communities where we live and work. We're really proud of our people and our high-performing culture at Range. We continue to work safely, protect the environment, meet our goals, make better wells and improve our cost structure quarter after quarter. All of this, combined with our high-quality, diverse and balanced portfolio, gives us confidence that we can deliver 20% to 25% production growth for many years into the future. Now over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny", "Thanks, Ray. 2013's second quarter extends the positive trends evident in the first quarter, namely, significantly stronger cash flow derived from higher revenue and lower unit cost. Oil, gas and NGL sales for the quarter were $416 million, up 34% from the second quarter of last year. Cash margin likewise improved, with second quarter cash margin coming in at $2.71 per Mcfe, a 15% increase over last year. With top line growth outpacing expense growth, cash flow for the second quarter was $227 million, 46% over last year's second quarter. Cash flow per share for the second quarter was $1.40, 44% higher than last year.", "EBITDAX for the second quarter was $269 million, 37% higher than last year. GAAP net income, which includes noncash hedging mark-to-market entries, asset sales gains and other non-recurring items, were $144 million for the second quarter. Earnings calculated using analyst methodology, which excludes these items, was $55 million, more than double last year's second quarter earnings of $18 million.", "Please remember that all non-GAAP figures I just mentioned are fully reconciled to GAAP on the Range website. You may have noticed that last year, we began sighting our unit cost guidance in our quarterly earnings release. With this practice established, beginning with this call, in order to allow more time for operations updates and Q&A, I will no longer be providing detailed quarterly cost performance commentary and guidance. I'll confine my remarks to quarterly cost items, where our actual quarterly results differed from guidance.", "Our first better-than-guidance cost item is third-party transportation gathering and compression at $0.80 per Mcfe, that's $0.02 below guidance due to the timing of expenditures, well hookups and a higher-than-projected production. We believe that $0.80 to $0.82 slot is a good estimate for the third quarter. Reduction in ad valorem taxes for the second quarter of $0.13 per Mcfe was $0.02 below guidance due to higher production from lower-cost areas. Our current estimate of third quarter production tax is between $0.14 and $0.15.", "Exploration expense, excluding noncash compensation, was $12 million for the quarter, quite a bit below guidance due to the timing of seismic expenditures. Our seismic budget for the year hasn't changed, so next quarter should see this expense increase to between $19 million and $21 million. Unproved property impairment for the second quarter at $19 million was $2 million over guidance, reflecting the write-off of some nonstrategic unproved acreage in Texas. Third quarter should see this expense back in the $15 million to $17 million range.", "G&A expense was $0.01 over guidance at $0.43 per Mcfe, due primarily to higher legal fees. We anticipate cash G&A unit cost for the third quarter to be between $0.40 and $0.42 per Mcfe. Lastly, interest expense on a unit cost basis is beginning to reflect the benefits of both higher production and the recent refinancing of several high-cost long-term bonds. Second quarter interest expense per Mcfe was well below our guidance at $0.54. Next quarter, we should see this expense fall another $0.02 to $0.03 in Mcfe.", "Over on the Range balance sheet, the major changes since last quarter are the closing of the Permian asset sale, which garnered an $83 million pretax gain and the early redemption of the $250 million 7 1/4 notes, which were pre-funded by the issuance of lower-cost 5% notes during the first quarter. And at the end of the second quarter, Range had approximately $1.4 billion in committed available liquidity under its credit facility, and approximately $1.6 billion in total available liquidity under our $2 billion credit facility borrowing base.", "Earlier in the second quarter, Range added to its 2013, 2014 and 2015 hedge position with additional natural gas, oil and NGL hedges. Please reference to Range website and press release tables for detailed hedge volumes and prices.", "In conclusion, the standout financial metric this quarter is the 46% increase in year-over-year quarterly cash flow. This increase illustrates the significance of steadily increasing production, combined with slightly higher prices and slightly lower cost. With production anticipated to increase 20% to 25% for many years to come, and our economies of scale still building, we look forward to many future quarters of cash flow growth.", "Jeff, back to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "Jeff and Ray, question on your lateral lengths in terms of driving the increase in returns in EURs. Ray, do you think you're about where you think you're going to be from a lateral length in terms of 4,500 feet? Or as you move further throughout the year or next few quarters that you may end up continuing to push those out, lateral lengths even further like others in industry have? And would you expect similar impacts on EURs?", "Ray N. Walker", "That's a good question, Ron. We currently have or are implementing the designs that we've just put in the presentation. So we're driving the wet area up to the 4,500-foot range, the dry area to 5,000-foot. And again, those, when we present them in the presentation, they're really an average of the whole program, so we're always drilling some that are longer than those, and some that are shorter. So our absolute goal is, yes, to drive these laterals longer and longer as they get in time. But right now, our best estimate of what we've got planned for next year are the numbers that we've got in the presentation, that we're presenting in the earnings release.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, good. And just on the 3 years worth of data you had on the down spacing, relative to expectations in terms of the 80% EUR of the 1,000-foot laterals, where does that -- where did that come out relative to your expectations and is that something that, as you move forward from a development standpoint, you'll plan on being closer to 50 or 60 acre spacing across your play? Or where do you think that will settle out?", "Ray N. Walker", "I think the -- our expectations going into -- we're probably in that 75% to 80% range. I think we see that in a lot of different fields across the country. It's a little bit hard to estimate and that's one reason that we wanted to see some real production history before we came out with numbers. We're dealing with a shale that's clearly better than anything we've ever seen before, and I want to look at that. I believe that we think that there's potentially some upside, they could perform a little better than that as we implement some of the RCS and some of the better targeting that wasn't actually done in these laterals. So I do think there's more upside in that, and I'm not sure what the second part of your question was, but I do think we see that there'll be down space or a tighter spacing, is a better way to say it, potential across all through the Marcellus.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "And is the 12 to 15 Ts just related to the Marcellus in your wet and super-rich areas? Does that include any -- or any resource potential for Upper Devonian or anything else?", "Ray N. Walker", "No, the 12 to 15 TCF equivalent that we added is only Marcellus, and only in the wet and super-rich area.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Real quickly, when we think about the Southwest Marcellus and the rates of return that you guys have outlined, and you compare that to rates return on the Northeast or Nora, well those are held by production property, it would seem like are primarily held by production. You wouldn't want to be pushing the drill bit there, really at all. You'd want to be redirecting drill bit and all capital toward Southwest Marcellus. Does those -- put those up as potential divestiture assets over time?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I think, one, when you look at the wells in the northern Marcellus, or the stuff up in the Northeast, you're going to see the same-type thing. We didn't update it this time. You're going to see some wells where you're going to have 5,000; 6,000; 7,000-foot laterals, and we'll be -- obviously, we share that technology throughout the company. In fact, throughout the industry and knowing what and what others are doing as well, so beware. I mean, I think you're going to see some impressive things in the future coming from that team, and we have a really strong team up there as well. We always look at redirecting our capital into the highest return areas that we have. We're focused on growing production per share, reserves per share, cash flow per share and bottom line, like we said, we think can basically at that 20% to 25% double and double again. That's being said, we look at all of our portfolio, and we look at the opportunities in there. Clearly, we're focused on per share growth. We have sold $2.3 billion worth of assets or something like that in the last few years, so we try to do the best things and keep focused. Now that being said, we think, the -- just like Ray mentioned, the stuff in the Southern Appalachian Basin, although at today's prices it doesn't compete, but one, we not only is it all HBP, we own the minerals on a lot of it, so we actually have the royalty, which is a real advantage. And the little bit of capital we've spent there, they're doing the same thing, they're drilling longer laterals with more stages and significantly improving the returns there, which we haven't shared with you and updated, but there's a lot of upside and potential. But that being said, we will continually look at doing what we think is most optimum things for our shareholders.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Okay, I appreciate that. And then, maybe as a follow-up, dive in a little deeper in to the Southwest Marcellus, as you build out the ethane delivery capabilities and go from, call it 1,500 to 15,000 to 65,000 barrels of ethane extraction, can you relate that to what that means in terms of the amount of gas you can be producing, without violating pipeline limitations? In other words, the gas -- the true dry gas production growth that a company is that, or that's facilitated by that?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I'll try to walk through some of those numbers that I did earlier. I know that was a lot of numbers, and I went through them pretty quick. But with -- just with the 3 deals we have in hand, combined, those 3 deals are 55,000 barrels of ethane per day. So and that's just, obviously related to the wet and the super-rich, so that enables us to put 1.8 Bcf of wet natural gas into the processing plants with those 3 deals. And again, with the 55,000 barrels of ethane and the 1.8 Bs of gas, you get in an additional 140,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids and condensates. So it's 1.8 Bs of gas plus -- and when you add the 55,000 of ethane, and the 140,000 of natural gas liquids and condensates, 195,000 barrels of liquids, plus 1.8 Bcf per day into the plant. And in addition, so that's what -- just those 3 deals. Obviously, our team is looking ahead to grow and do everything else, and then on top of that, then you've got to add the dry gas areas, which you don't need the processing for. Indeed, we have great dry gas position in the Southwest PA and again, we went through there. We think in the Southwest, and when you look at those things on a per lateral foot basis, they're excellent and drilling 5,000-foot lateral with 25 stages, we think they're going to be over 12 Bcf wells. And plus, we've got some great dry gas acreage in the Northeast as well. So and that's really what I was trying to lay out. Our team's done a very good job. We have a long-range plan looking at how we're going to develop the asset, how we're going to grow at that 20% to 25% or wherever ends up being optimum and have laid in place to take away for the ethane, take away for these other natural gas liquids, and as well as layering in the dry gas pieces. And then on top of that, you have to fold in the rest of the company and what we do with that as well. That's why we have the confidence to say we can consistently drill at 20% to 25% per year with -- at low cost, with high returns. Again, going back to Page 23 in the rates of return that Ray mentioned. So that hopefully that answered your question. So it's 1.8 Bs just in that area, plus all those 195,000 barrels of liquids plus your dry gas.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "That does, if I could just do one more follow-up. When you start outlining that kind of gas production and we think of peers who are out there, both in dry gas, wet gas window, people who are in the dry gas window of the Utica, ultimately, what does that do for you guys, in terms of thinking about the macro gas picture? Is gas ultimately, then going to be, surpassing the demand of the Eastern markets and flowing back to Gulf Coast markets and what might that mean to pricing?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, I think, you always look at the pricing, where the markets are, and we've got 80% of our 2014 needed transport and marketing arrangements already in place. That other 20% really allows us to hit the spot and other attractive markets that are developing because of the displacement that the markets -- that the Marcellus is doing. There will be some pricing pressures in certain areas of the Marcellus where more gas is coming online than producers have a market for. Luckily, in the Southwest area, we're fortunate to have 6 of the largest pipelines in Appalachia running through the core of our Southwest area. We estimate that, that would equate to 15 to 20 Bcf a day of transportation capacity and opportunity to reach markets that are a forward haul or backhaul, as you alluded to, to hit those markets as to where you need to be. Fast markets, generally in the U.S., the premium markets are going to turn over about every 3 to 4 years, so therefore, you need the flexibility to hit those markets and keep those market arrangements fresh. So that's our portfolio and that's what we're focused on. Therefore, we think the capacity that's already in place, then as they have additional expansions come on in the basin, that will actually relieve the pressure on those existing capacities, which should give us more opportunity.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with RBC.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just kind of sticking with the Marcellus here. Obviously, you guys dramatically increased your type curves in Southwest PA. One thing, just noticing on some of those numbers is that it looks like really the NGL and the gas components were up significantly in the EURs, while the condensate component really wasn't as much. Could maybe you guys address that?", "Ray N. Walker", "What we've done is, like we've done continuously over the last 6 or 7 years is, as we get more and more data, we're just trying to refine that and make better and better estimates. I mean, that helps us forecast what we need as far as capacity and condensate sales and storage and facilities and all the things that go with that, so that's been a gradual process. So what we're putting forward is, what we believe we're going to expect to see going forward. And I think the condensate issue, we believe there's some upside there, there's no question about that. We clearly got some IPs that are huge, that are really fun to talk about. But I think we're going to be reluctant to forecast those wells until we see a lot more of them. Those -- we don't want to take something that's a highlight real type item, and then build all our forecast off of that. So we're still looking at a lot of normal distribution of results and we still try to use that going forward. So everything we've put in here is our best estimate going forward, and we did put some new type curves in the back of the book, Page 36, 37 or -- and 38, to update all of those and their byproducts. So you'll see all of the actual things. And that's all based on wells, actual wells, that we have planned for '14. I mean, we've got well names, we got most of the permits in place, everything's already set, so I think that's a very good approximation of what we've got planned to go forward.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "All right. So you guys aren't seeing, maybe declining condensate yield on the wells in the wet and the super-rich, at this point?", "Ray N. Walker", "No. I think it's more a factor of just where you drill. I mean, as we go from the East side to the West side, your BTU changes, your maturities, so you've got more condensate on the West side, more heavier portions of the NGL barrel. You also have more ethane on that side. You just flat got more liquids. We've got some wells that are 80% plus liquids, all the way down into the low teens on the eastern edge of the wet areas. So I think it's just more timing and when those wells hit on the schedule and all of that. And again, what we're doing is taking all of that and making a forecast at an average type curve, and putting that in the book, so it's probably just more of an impact of that than anything else.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and I guess on your dry wells in Southwest Pennsylvania, if you guys have these bar charts in terms of [indiscernible] in '11 and '12, and then sort of forecast for 13 and '14, that one kind of stand out a little bit to me, because it looks like your EURs per 1,000 lateral foot on the dry in Southwest PA were actually going down a little bit where the wet and the super-rich were going up pretty substantially. Just wanted to get some color on why you think that is there?", "Ray N. Walker", "Sure. The wells that are coming online in '13 are actually wells that we planned, permitted and probably mostly drilled in 2012. A lot of those weren't -- were not using the best targeting methods that we know today. They weren't using RCS completions and different things like that. So you're going to see that impact things going forward. But what we've also done -- what we've typically done is, as we drill these much longer laterals, we're not assigning a 1-for-1 add, as you add stages going forward. We're taking a real conservative approach and putting the risk factor on those additional stages that might be further and further out in that longer lateral. In other words, 1 plus 1 is not always 2 in our mind when you're adding that. So that's -- it's just simply our best conservative estimate at this point of what those wells will be. Will they do better? I actually believe they will, but again, there's still a lot of upside in that area, and we're seeing some really impressive results there. And looking at -- it's not only us looking at offset operators in the area, there's some really nice wells that are being made out there. So we, again, believe, there's -- we're going to see a lot of upside in the EUR per thousand foot even when you look at it that way.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "All right, and I guess, am I correct in assuming that you've got a lot fewer wells and fewer production history in dry in Southwest Pennsylvania versus the wet areas, is that right?", "Ray N. Walker", "Oh, absolutely. Yes, that, a lot of that acreage is already HBP-ed for us. It was legacy assets that we had, and -- but we don't have the same number of wells there yet, that we have in the wet area.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "All right, so I guess that would explain the conservatism here overall for you guys then?", "Ray N. Walker", "Absolutely. Yes.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I guess just jumping over to the Mississippian real quick, I think you guys have previously talked about on prior calls, now roughly doubling the rig count in 2014, getting roughly double the activity. Obviously, I know you guys have added efficiencies, you don't have to add as many rigs, but given a bit of a slow start to the year in the program, I know you guys explain that in your press release. And also given the fact that the returns on the Marcellus look like they've improved quite a bit, we potentially expect lower levels of activity in the Miss, and maybe shifting more activity to the Marcellus next year? How we -- should we think about that?", "Ray N. Walker", "I think the best way to answer that is, that we've always said the Horizontal Mississippian play is really an emerging play. We've got 160,000 net acres there. It looks real impressive to us. We have experimented with different style fracs and designs and so forth. We feel like it's on track, things are looking pretty good. But at this point, like we said, even though we used to say in the past it was going to be 5, 10, 15 rigs forward, that was always with the caveat that we had to see the results going forward. And that's why it's only a small portion of our budget and so forth. But I think we'll reserve the right to make that decision until we lock in the budget towards the end of the year with the board. But I do think there's still a lot of upside there, but we're just going to have to wait and see what the results look like at the -- towards the end of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess, I'm afraid I'm going to go back to the Marcellus as well. The pace of completions in the second half of the year clearly slows down quite dramatically. Is that a function of the higher cost of the longer lateral wells? And I just wonder if you could help us with a little bit of color as to how those sort of wells are much higher return, or at least a much higher return, with a higher CapEx. What does that mean in terms of activity levels, as it relates to rig count going into 2014?", "Ray N. Walker", "Doug, that's a great question. I think the -- it's more related to the fact that we've got a big capital budget. We're not going to raise it, we're going to stick to it. And what we saw early in the year is what we've seen for the last several years, is the Southern Marcellus shale division, just like a lot of divisions across the company, is making really great improvements in efficiency. I mean, the rigs are down to 4 or 5 days in some cases now. The frac crews are doing 9 stages in 24 hours, where a year ago, they are doing 3, 4 and 5 stages in 24 hours. So what happens is, you kind of by default end up frontloading the capital during the front portion of the year because we just get a lot more wells online. So we'll see a gradual slow down. We are also with the longer laterals. It's basically the drilling rate. The drilling rate times not a lot longer, but the completion time does add to it, when you go from 14 stages to 20-plus stages, it will take longer. And so I think when you combine those 2 things, you're going to see what we typically have always seen up there in the Marcellus, that the year tends to be frontloaded and then the rate of completions or the rate of wells coming online towards the end of the year will slow down.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. That was very clear. So just to be -- I guess, just to be clear on that, so currently, your backlog is in the low 40s, as I recollect?", "Ray N. Walker", "I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "The backlog of uncompleted wells is sitting in the low 40s, where would you expect that to get to by the end of the year?", "Ray N. Walker", "I think the total backlog is about 70, and I think it will come down slightly by the end of the year.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. I guess, my follow-up is really going back to the question about the lateral end. I mean, you've talked about obviously, you've stepped these up pretty ratably over the last several years. But are you testing longer laterals beyond what you've disclosed in your latest guidance? In other words, where does the 4,000-foot lateral go to next, in terms of what you think might be optimal over the [indiscernible]?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, absolutely. And again, remember, these type curves and economics that we're quoting for you are the average of the program going forward through 2014 and into '15, actually. So, yes, we will drill quite a few longer laterals and quite a few shorter. I think our longest lateral today is about 6,000-foot. I suspect we'll probably go to 7,000 in some cases. The wells, the highlight well that I talked about being over 5,000 to 5,720 barrel a day well, that was a 5,000-foot lateral. So we're already doing it, and yes, and we will continue to basically experiment with longer and longer laterals and more and more stages, trying to find that optimum project return, which is what we're focused on, so.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, is there any limitation in terms of having the older sections bolted together that might limit you going to a more aggressive well design as we go forward?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "No. I think, the team's doing a great job of planning and looking at those opportunities and just consistently really, ever since we've been in the play, year after year, the wells get better. And given where we are, and given the fact that probably longer laterals with more stages, better targeting, more RCFs, will probably continue to drive up performance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan McSpirit from BMO Capital Markets.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "In years, what do you model as the life for wells drilled in the Marcellus? And in what year is terminal decline achieved? And as a follow-up to that, does any of that change much with an increase in lateral length or change in completion design?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, we have with us Alan Farquharson, Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering, so he heads up all that for the entire company. I'll just turn it over to Alan then, of course.", "Alan W. Farquharson", "Thanks, Dan. First of all, the life that we model is about 45 years, out for the Marcellus is what you're seeing in there right now. I cannot specifically give you when we get to the terminal decline rate right off the top of my head, but I can tell you that we do use a multiple decline rate. We're using more than 2 in the projections that we have, so you're not looking at a single B factor going throughout the entire life of the well. I'd have to get back to you on the exact time of when we hit a terminal decline rate, but it's fairly far out in the future.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "You can coordinate with our IR team, and they can set a call up with Alan to get into some more of the specifics.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, great, and just maybe a follow-up to that, is there any impact on the decline rates on wells drilled under the tighter spacing scenario, if at all?", "Alan W. Farquharson", "Well, I think your question is, is the shape of the curve going to look a lot different on tighter wells than what it is on the wider spaced wells?", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Right.", "Roger S. Manny", "Is that kind of the general question? Now as you can kind of see in the book on...", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Page 25.", "Alan W. Farquharson", "On Page 25, they actually do follow a relatively similar decline rate and obviously, a lot of those wells, with 3 years of history, we -- that was one of the reasons, as Ray mentioned earlier, we want to make sure we had enough information on these wells before we came out and talked about them. But overall, to date, they found very, very similar production profiles in terms of decline rates.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Great. And then lastly, just turning to the balance sheet, quickly. Can you repeat for me the leverage goals for year end, and maybe periods beyond?", "Roger S. Manny", "Yes, sure, Dan. I mean, we -- Range is an operating strategy driven company, not a financial strategy driven company, so we don't have hard leverage goals out there that we're going to manage to. We're going to manage the operations first, and then we're just going to keep that leverage and, for a lack of better term, our comfort zone. And as we've kind of talked about before, that comfort zone extends into the low 3 times debt-to-EBITDAX range, and then obviously as low as it needs to go to address the times that we're operating in. So right at about 2.8x, trailing 4 quarter debt to EBITDAX at the end of the second quarter, it's well down from fourth quarter of last year. And as we've said, based on current prices in our current hedge book, that ratio will grind down over time, not to any specific objective, but clearly at 2.8, we're very comfortable with that level of leverage, and are just fine anywhere in that zone.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "When you look at that long-term plan, about 20% to 25% growth for many years and basically doubling every 3 to 4 years, keeping our capital outspend to that $250 million to $350 million over cash flow in the early years, as we continue to grow, we strip pricing, we significantly de-lever over time, so.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Hsulin Peng with Robert W. Baird.", "Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So my first question is, given that you're drilling longer lateral wells, can you discuss how this will affect your HBP schedule for acreage in Marcellus?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, I think we're in great shape there. We break it out by area, and like we've said many times, we've got a plan to basically hold all that acreage we want to hold. It'll happen with time. And I think an important thing to consider beyond that is, in addition to drilling to hold it which we'll ultimately do, all the leases that we'll be drilling also have extensions, on that number of tickers, so we have more than enough time to hold acreage, but we have a clear plan for that, and that will happen, and will.", "Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then, so a more high-level question. Given the updated resource potential and nearly 2 million acres with a stack pay in the Northeast, can you give us your current thoughts on how you are thinking about, in terms of potentially accelerating or optimizing the value of these assets, especially in the back end of the value? If you're happy with the status quo, with the organic growth, how -- I guess, what could be some trigger points where you or and the board could reevaluate your strategy?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, we do that, really in realtime, I won't say constantly, but frequently. It's something we're always looking at, is how do we maximize the value of our company. So again, I've said this before, at year end last year, where you're at net, at around 0.8 Bs per day, 20%, 25% growth in 3 years, we think we'll be about 1.6 Bcfe per day net. And go out another 3 years, that's 3.2 over 3 Bs. So we think, in that, from the end of the last year, in that roughly 6-year timeframe, we'll be over 3 Bs per day net, which is -- and I tried to lay that out pretty clearly in my notes upfront, near my call notes upfront, to say that we've got the liquids agreements, and a lot of the gas processing and everything in place to get there, which is phenomenal growth. The key is, it doesn't stop at 3 Bs per day, with the inventory we have, 3 can become 4, 5 or 6, which is, and then again, look at all the other E&P companies in the U.S. on a net basis, that's phenomenal growth for a company our size, with our market cap. Importantly, from very low-risk areas that, basically all that acreage in the Southwest and in the North East is de-risked. So it has very low reinvestment risk, there's a lot of drilling around it, the quality of the wells are excellent, yet they're getting better. Costs are coming down so we'll look at that all the time. We think we have a great plan that laid out, so we're not just looking at what do we want to do in 1 year or 2, it's in what do we want to do in your 1, 3, 5, 10 and beyond. However, we continually look at optimizing it. Like I said, we've sold $2.3 billion or so worth of assets in the last few years, so we're always looking at building and high grading as well, or where there more optimum ways to do it. But what we really think, if we -- if nothing else, if we just consistently execute on the plan we laid out, we think we will really drive up production per share, reserves per share and cash flow per share consistently with time in one of the highest rate of return plays out there. That being said, we'll always look and see if there's better ways to do our business.", "Hsulin Peng - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then last question is more macro. So we have seen a bit of volatility with the Appalachian basis differential recently. And so I'm just wondering if you can give us more details on how you're -- where your pricing points are in -- within Appalachia, how you sell the contract for your gas sales, and how do you navigate through these volatile differential environment?", "Roger S. Manny", "We've got a great marketing team that's been doing this. So the contracts that we have today were put in place 2 to 3 years ago. That was a time to put them in place for these types of times, so that you've got contracts with pricing that goes through the soft periods as other producers bring on gas. Range does not bring any gas to market that doesn't already have a buyer on the other end, so we're not pushing any of that basis differential. Then we've moved our contacts to stay out as much as possible out of any Appalachian indexed type of price to minimize that. And then, of course, we've got our hedge position from that area. But basically, with the flexibility that we have, with the dynamic market that you have, with marketing arrangements and working with one of the largest producers in Appalachia, we have access to a lot of markets that give us this opportunity to lock in prices on a long-term basis. And that's going to be able to get us through these periods of time until other facilities, other producers get built, that allows us to continue to maximize our value.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Say, just a question on the Slide 10, where you guys break out by the wet and dry acreage and show different stack pays. I was wondering, kind of question about the Utica. Obviously, it looks like you do have a lot of potential for the Utica and, again, I'm just wondering as far as going after that or drilling other than that prior well that you had. Is that more dependent on waiting to see other results? Or given how successful you've been in the Marcellus and starting to be in Upper Devonian, why go to that now at this time? I'm just wondering what your thought processes is on that.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, you make a great point. On Slide 10, we're pointing out for those of you that haven't looked at it, we think, not only do we have 1 million net acres, really when you look at the stack pay potential, we lay it out on Slide 10, it's prospective for a number of horizons. Neal specifically asked about the Utica. And we have 180,000 net acres, wet acreage in the Northwest and 400,000 of dry in Southwest. The good news is all the stuff in the Northwest is HBP. When you look at the stuff in the Southwest, any well, to any horizon holds all horizons for us. So we have such prolific Marcellus wells, and it's so low risk at this point in time. Like I said, essentially all that acreage is de-risked. We'll just consistently drive up production and cash flow and reserves with the Southwest and hold those opportunities. The good news is, in both areas, there's a lot of drilling around us, some in of the Northwest and also, even in the dry, there's some wells that are coming right up against our acreage position. Of course, we're going to route those wells on. And then, we have the ability to stay focused on investing our dollars on low-risk things to generate returns, yet to the extent those other operators have success, we'll be able to capture that. To the extent they don't, we'll have saved some risk investment, but we think there's great potential. And particularly, it's interesting to look at the stuff in the Southwest, when you map high-quality rock, we have great Utica potential down there. It's high porosity, it's going to be high pressure, it's thick. And then, of course, it's stacked, so then you have all the advantages of infrastructure, roads, plants, pipelines, team and all that type of thing. So very excited about the potential but in the interim, in the short run, we're going to stay focused on the Marcellus and see how the rest of that plays out. And then we'll come back with, to the extent it's successful, what's the most optimum way to capture the value.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "That makes sense. Two more if I could, Jeff. Just looking at your maps, they're at very good detail. You certainly have the dominant position in Marcellus and/or one of the dominant positions. But what's evident is there certainly somewhere you control, and there's a little bit, kind of little holes here and there. Is that going to enable you to add, maybe not but some might call material, but still add a fair amount of acreage for relatively low prices, because you can kind of walk some people out, if you will?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, I think there will be opportunities with time when you get a big blocky position like that, and there are small holes with time then. Your point's well taken, that we would be the logical person to pick the acreage up. We'll have infrastructure to take away the team, the pad and it'll be most efficient for us to develop it, so, yes, we'll clearly look at those opportunities and, therefore, you could see us capture some of those, with time.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just last, maybe a quick one for Ray. I know others we hear more about, maybe in the Eagle Ford and other areas, about people adding more sand per stage, and trying to obviously squeeze more out of that. Just wondering, Ray, maybe your thoughts as far as you guys obviously having fantastic results, besides maybe this multi-cluster. I mean, is there things to add more sand per stage, or what's your thoughts about that?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, I think that all across the industry, people are focused on more stages in the lateral, more in better conductivity in the near wellbore region, and all of that. And, yes, we've been working on that since we started in 2006. We're continually looking at proppants, different mixes of proppants, different amounts of proppants, different concentrations and all of that. And I think that's just going to evolve over time. And one of the other things, the Marcellus is such -- it's in the largest hydrocarbon basin in North America, and I think sometimes we fall in the trap of thinking the Marcellus is the Marcellus everywhere, and it's not. It's not even the same from one side of the super-rich to the other side of the super-rich. And so, I think you're going to see all the operators talking about more conductivity, more frac jobs, more stages and working through that. The good news is, we're all exchanging data now. So we're doing lots of technical reviews on a quarterly basis and different things like that, that are helping everybody move up that learning curve faster. So yes, we are doing it, and I do expect there's going to be some upside in the well performance due to that, also.", "Operator", "We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Louis Baltimore of Macquarie for our final question.", "Louis Baltimore - Macquarie Research", "So your newly increased EUR estimates for the super-rich wells appear to be based off actual production from 17 wells drilled during the first quarter, that have average lateral lengths of 3,500 feet in 18 frac stages. Yet the new well design calls for 4,500 foot lateral lengths with 22 stages, and uses that same EUR estimate. So given the additional 1,000 feet of lateral, and 4 more stages, it would seem like these new EUR estimates are already too low?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, I hope so. One of the things that we don't want to fall in the trap of just like, we have always been very data based in our projections. And those 17 wells, I totally agree with you, look like they could be in the range of what we're projecting for the wells going forward, with longer laterals. But again, we're not -- we want to see more data on those 17 wells, so we've only got 4 months of history so far, and we want to make sure that, that's consistent. We've been applying a lot more RCS, we've been changing our targets and optimizing that a lot more, and we're still going up the learning curve in the super-rich area. We don't have the history quite there yet, that we have in the wet area, so we are being conservative. And we don't want to take some really, some -- a group of wells that are really performing well in 1 specific area, and then base everything off of that, until we get more wells under our belts. So you're pointing out a great point, and it gives us confidence and that plus some of the EURs, like the wells I talked about in my remarks, and in the press release that are longer laterals and clearly going to be above those curves, all of that gives us a lot of confidence that there's a lot of upside, but we're not really wanting to model our forward projections on that yet.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to talk to in the call back to Mr. Ventura for closing remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Given Range's large, high-quality low-risk acreage position and drilling inventory, we continue to believe that in addition to growing production 20% to 25% this year, we have 20% to 25% line of sight growth for many years. With the high returns in our projects assuming current strip pricing, our cash flow is expected to outpace our production growth. We're also projecting that with current strip pricing, we'll be reducing the leverage of our company with time, as we drive up production and cash flow. Led by our approximately 1 million net acre position in Pennsylvania, we project that we will consistently drive up production and reserves on a per share basis, net adjusted for years to come. Plus we continue to be one of the lowest cost producers in the peer group and are still improving. We believe that this plan will translate into substantial shareholder value in the months and years ahead.

[Operator Instructions]", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney L. Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported outstanding results for the third quarter of 2013 with record production and a continuing decrease in unit costs. Both earnings and cash flow per share results were greater than First Call consensus.", "The order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.", "In addition, Chad Stevens, our Senior Vice President in charge of marketing, will be available to answer questions after our prepared remarks, and Mr. Pinkerton, our Executive Chairman is also available.", "Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on the home page of our website, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we have posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliations of our adjusted non-GAAP earnings to reported earnings that are discussed on the call.", "Now let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you, Rodney. Before we get into the details of the third quarter and into Q&A, I would like to say that Range has a really simple story. At Range, we believe we have the opportunity to grow production 20% to 25% per year for many years. This is led by our Marcellus Shale position in Pennsylvania. Growing on a compounded basis of 20% of 25% per year means that we can double our net production every 3 to 4 years. Not only is that great growth, it comes with some of the best returns in the industry.", "As shown on Slide 28 in the investor presentation on our website, our pretax rate of return for our super-rich wet and dry areas in the Marcellus in southwest Pennsylvania is currently projected to be about 100% for all 3 areas.", "What differentiates Range from its peers is the size and quality of our position. We have approximately 1 million net acres in the state of Pennsylvania. When the stacked pay potential of the acreage is considered, we believe it's like approximately 2 million net acres. This is shown on Slides 9 and 10 in the investor presentation.", "We're also advantaged in that a lot of the acreage in Pennsylvania is in the southwest part of the state.", "When mapping hydrocarbon in plays for the Marcellus, the overlying Upper Devonian shales and the Utica/Point Pleasant play, the southwest portion of Pennsylvania, and notably, Washington County is the only place where you can stack all 3 horizons.", "Stated another way, if you consider all 3 horizons, the maximum hydrocarbon in place is in southwest Pennsylvania, with Washington County being an optimum place to be. This is shown on Slides 11 to 14 in our investor presentation.", "The southwest Marcellus offers other advantages. This is the only area where there are prolific dry, wet and super-rich fairways of the Marcellus. Again, our acreage in Washington County is particularly well positioned in all 3 fairways.", "Southwest Pennsylvania also contains better infrastructure and takeaway capacity. Given that Range was a first mover in the Marcellus play, coupled with our strong marketing team, we believe we have secured enough firm transportation and firm sales to move essentially all of our projected production in this area to good markets. The result is that we have the ability to both grow production and do it with good netback realizations.", "Range has a consistent long-term strategy of growing our production and reserves per share, net adjusted with the top quartile or better cost structure. We have a long-term track record of successfully delivering on that strategy. Very importantly, we're growing in one of the highest rate-of-return plays in the business, possibly the highest.", "As I mentioned earlier, if we grow production 20% to 25% per year for many years, then our production will double in 3 to 4 years and then double again and so on. Depending on where commodity pricing is, our cash flow will either grow proportionally with production or possibly in excess of production growth.", "If cash flow just grows proportionately with production, then our cash flow will double in 3 to 4 years, and then double again and beyond. Based on our cash flow multiple for our stock, then our stock price will double in 3 to 4 years and then double again thereafter.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations for the quarter.", "Ray N. Walker", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Over the last few calls, I've discussed many of the technologies that we've introduced down hole, things like RCS completions, enhanced frac designs, better targeting and increasingly longer laterals. Not only do our teams do a great job down hole, they are also making impressive strides on the surface. One of the best measures of that performance is direct operating expense, and compared to the prior-year quarter, our direct operating expenses on a per unit basis are down 15%.", "In the southern Marcellus, we averaged 166 frac stages per month in 2012. And this year with the same amount of frac crews and equipment, we're averaging 196 stages per month, which is a staggering 18% improvement at this stage of the development.", "Last year, our facilities team, who developed the first 0-vapor protocol designs in the basin, was building facilities that already exceeded the new EPA standards, which in and of itself is a great accomplishment.", "Recently, they fine-tuned that design, resulting in a 20% upgrade in condensate pricing at some of our sites. And they're working on expanding that application, which we expect to add real value going forward. They were also able to realize a 15% reduction in facility costs this year at the same time.", "On the land side, we're developing 75% more acreage per pad year-over-year. So when considering operating expenses, facility designs, logistics, marketing and even the efficiency of which we're developing our acreage, I believe our teams are among the best out there, and I want to congratulate all our teams across the company.", "We are exceeding our operating targets across-the-board. Third quarter production for the company came in at 960 million cubic feet equivalent per day with 23% liquids, which was above the high end of our guidance, which was 940 million to 950 million with 22% liquids. We can attribute the exceptional growth to better-than-expected timing, along with increasingly strong well performance both occurring in southwest Pennsylvania.", "Marcellus production for the third quarter averaged 756 million cubic feet equivalent per day, net to Range, and for the first 9 months of this year, averaged 718 million. When compared to the same time period in 2012, that's a 40% increase year-over-year in our Marcellus production.", "Additionally, we reached another major milestone in the Marcellus where over a period of several days, we produced over 1 million gallons per day of NGLs, net to Range, with an additional 8,300 barrels per day of condensate.", "In northeast Pennsylvania, we have 1 rig running. During the third quarter, we brought online a step-out well in Lycoming County with a 24-hour IP of 23 million a day and a 30-day average rate of 15 million a day. At 60 days, the well cumed over 3/4 of the Bcf.", "In the last couple of weeks, we brought online 2 more wells on that same pad under constrained conditions at a combined rate of over 42 million a day. The average IP to sales of those 3 wells, again all were under constrained conditions, is 22 million a day with an average lateral length of 5,000 foot, 23 stages and an average revenue interest of 86%. As we further develop this area with longer laterals and more stages, we expect even better returns.", "In the super-rich area in southwest Pennsylvania, we brought online 24 wells in the third quarter, with an average IP to sales of 2,657 Boe per day, with 66% liquids. Now just for clarification, all the rates that I quote today for the super-rich and wet areas of the Marcellus include 80% ethane extraction. The average 24-hour IPs during the third quarter were 43% higher, with condensate rates being 54% higher than the previous quarter. That's a really impressive group of wells. And again, my congratulations to the southern Marcellus team for a job very well done.", "The 17 super-rich wells that we've been tracking in our presentation and over the last few calls are still holding up nicely and performing well above the 2012 curve. With 240 days online, those wells are 43% above the curve, and we've updated that information on Slide #18 in the presentation.", "Specifically at the last call, I announced the brand-new, super-rich well that had just IP-ed that week at over 5,700 Boe per day with 63% liquids. As a further update, for the first 30 days, the well averaged over 2,700 Boe per day with 61% liquids and cumed almost half a Bcf equivalent. And at 60 days, the well averaged over 2,100 Boe per day with 60% liquids and cumed over 3/4 of a Bcf equivalent.", "As further confirmation of that area, that well was 1 well of a 4-well pad that had an average 24-hour IP per well of 4,143 Boe per day with 63% liquids, which is including 571 barrels per day of condensate per well.", "After 60 days, the 4 wells on the pad averaged almost 2,000 Boe per day with 61% liquids each. The average lateral length is a little over 4,000 feet with 22 stages. Again, here's another example of some really strong wells that support our belief that we've not drilled our best wells yet, as we continue to see better and better results.", "I'd like to call your attention to the fact that we've added a new slide in our presentation on Page 17, showing our top-10, super-rich Marcellus wells.", "When comparing on a 24-hour IP basis, we have 5 of the top-10 wells in the basin, including the Utica. On a normalized initial production rate per thousand foot of lateral basis, we have 8 of the top 10 liquids-rich wells in the basin. Again, we use 80% ethane recovery in our numbers and only considered wells with more than 60% liquids. Also, the range IPs are based on actual 24-hour production to sales, and in most all cases, our wells start out constrained by facilities.", "Our super-rich wells are already basin-leading wells, as you can see by this data. But as we drill longer laterals and continue to see improvements like we've seen over the last year, there's no doubt that our super-rich acreage position is a class-leading asset that would yield even greater value than we see today.", "We've now released gas in place or sometimes referred to hydrocarbon in place maps for each horizon -- the Marcellus, the Upper Devonian and the Utica -- that also show our perspective acreage in each case. All this is shown on Pages 11 to 14 in our presentation, so let me walk you through those now.", "When you look at the Marcellus gas in place map, you not only see southwest and northeast PA as 2 distinct core areas from a gas in place standpoint, they have also proven to be core from a productivity standpoint, even though they exhibit different reservoir characteristics. You can definitely see the high gas in place area in northeast PA with highly productive dry gas wells. You also have southwest Pennsylvania as a highly productive area. Even though the gas in place is not as high in southwest Pennsylvania and the reservoir is thinner, the porosity and permeability are much higher than exhibited in northeast Pennsylvania, and you have the additional enhancement of the liquids and condensate. There are now over 7,000 wells with data supporting both these areas as being core and highly productive.", "Looking at the Upper Devonian, you see the highest gas in place area in southwest Pennsylvania, where Range drilled the first horizontal in 2009. We have tons of data on the Upper Devonian as we drill through it on our way to the Marcellus, and we continue to believe that it'll be highly productive. We've done significant testing and have cracked the code as we announced earlier this year with a 10 million cubic feet equivalent per day Upper Devonian horizontal well, with 60% liquids in the super-rich area, yielding what we believe is tremendous upside potential going forward.", "There's also been significant testing of the Upper Devonian throughout the basin, validating what we show in this analysis.", "Range also drilled the first horizontal in the Utica in 2009, leading us to be the first to recognize the stacked pay potential of the Utica/Point Pleasant underneath southwest Pennsylvania.", "When you analyze the data and all the offset activities, the largest amount of hydrocarbon in place in the Utica is centered across our 540,000 net acre position in southwest Pennsylvania, namely, in Washington County. This may seem a little contrary because most of the Utica activity to-date has been targeting the liquids-rich portion of the play because that's where everyone got started.", "There hasn't been a lot of dry gas Utica drilling, simply because most of it's located under the Range Marcellus activity in southwest Pennsylvania. Recently, we've seen a nearby well completed in the dry Utica/Point Pleasant making 11 million a day with only 8 stages that confirms our analysis. Under our Washington County acreage, we have the Point Pleasant interval, which is the key productive interval that's over 140-foot thick, with early estimates of over 150 Bcf of gas in place at high pressure at approximately 10,700 feet. And we now have a confirmation well nearby, all of which equals what we believe is really good potential for high volume, high return gas production.", "With longer laterals and enhanced completion designs, we believe the Utica/Point Pleasant and Washington County is very perspective, and we're currently working on plans to drill a horizontal Utica/Point Pleasant well in southwest Pennsylvania in 2014. When you stack all 3 plays together on Page 14, the largest gas in place in the basin is clearly in southwest Pennsylvania, namely under the Range acreage position. We secure all rights to all depths since we drilled Marcellus wells.", "A real upside going forward is that we expect significant gains and capital efficiency as we go back and develop the Upper Devonian and the Utica/Point Pleasant as much as the infrastructure of roads, pads, midstream and water will already be in place and paid for.", "Again, all of these yielding substantial durability in our growth projections with low investment risk. We control all the horizons in the highest gas in place acreage in the basin, and we have great diversity with super-rich, wet and dry gas production, all with some of the best returns in the basin and getting better.", "On the midstream and marketing front, we and our partners are doing well in staying in front of our capacity needs. We have contracts and commitments in place to support our needs, not only through the next couple of years, but for a number of years going forward. Mariner West is starting up, and we expect it to be fully functional later in the quarter, and thereby, alleviating any issues associated with BTU pipeline specs for Range in southwest Pennsylvania.", "Since Range discovered and pioneered the Marcellus focusing mostly in southwest Pennsylvania, we still, today, maintain our first-mover status in positioning ourselves to take advantage of the pipeline infrastructure that already exists in the region, all of this resulting in competitive netbacks.", "We're the largest wet gas producer in the basin, and our portfolio of marketing arrangements for all our products is among the best out there. An example of that is our 3 ethane deals, providing us both operational and market diversity for the long term. Once in operation, we expect these 3 contracts to provide an uplift in overall revenue.", "In our press release, we describe some of those details and make a comparison to today's pricing, showing that once these 3 projects are running, ethane would be selling for an equivalent gas price today of approximately $4.13, net of any transportation, plus we'll receive an additional 8% propane, meaning an additional $0.40 to $0.50 per mcf.", "This is substantially better than selling ethane as BTUs in the gas stream. Our expectation has always been and will remain to have very few wells that aren't flowing or aren't hooked up to gathering at the end of every year. And I believe our inventory of wells waiting on infrastructure is among the lowest in the basin.", "We've consistently met our volume targets every quarter, involving extensive coordination and planning efforts with our partners going out 3 years and beyond. And we've been turning our wells into sales quickly. We've had no significant curtailments due to interstate pipeline issues because our team has been instrumental in helping to solve issues that could affect the flow of our gas. And our sales prices in each region of the basin compare favorably.", "In summary, our team has us well positioned with firm transportation, firm sales and a plenty of compression and processing capacity to support our growth trajectory for the coming years at terms that are among the best in the basin. We don't say it enough, so I want to say it publicly to our marketing team because I know that they're listening today: job very well done. Chad Stevens, our Senior VP in charge of marketing, is with us today on the call and can provide additional details and answer questions during the Q&A.", "Now let me spend just a few minutes on some of the other activity across the company as all our teams are doing a great job, lowering cost and hitting their marks.", "In the Mississippian play in northern Oklahoma, we just completed a 12-mile step-out well that had daily production of over 300 barrels of oil per day for more than a week and has produced on average -- has produced an average of 330 Boe per day with 94% liquids, which is 85% oil for the last 30 days. This production mix is significantly different from the southern part of the play in that it's a much higher percentage of oil. And the production profile is much flatter, thus yielding really good economic returns. Again, being higher value oil and a flatter decline yields very good economics, and we believe this well helps to de-risk a large portion of our acreage.", "We've also applied some new completion designs on 4 of our recent wells that, while early, are showing significantly better results. Again, it's early, and this is only 4 wells with 65 days online, but they're performing 45% above the 600 Mboe type curve. We expect to bring online 4 more wells with new completions during the fourth quarter.", "In fact, just this week, one of those wells came online, initially moving 780 Boe per day with 82% liquids, and we're pretty sure the oil will go higher as it's only been online a few days.", "Importantly, even with these larger designs, the well costs will be flat to our current $3.2 million, which is exceptionally good news. The average 24-hour IP for our Mississippian wells brought online in the third quarter was 622 Boe per day with 75% liquids, and that's our highest average IP for any quarter today. All of this to say, we're seeing real improvement and encouragement in the Mississippian.", "Our Conger properties, we continue to closely monitor horizontal Cline and Wolfcamp activity. And of note, we're currently working on 2 7,000-foot laterals, one in the Cline and one in the upper Wolfcamp. The Cline well just started flowback after a 28-stage completion and with only 13% of the load recovered, the well is flowing up casing at over 400 psi, making about 1.2 million a day in gas with 500 barrels of oil, which is over 850 Boe per day. And the pressure, gas rate and oil rate have been steadily increasing for days. These are really encouraging results this early in the flow back, being much better and much sooner than anything we've seen to date.", "On the upper Wolfcamp horizontal, we just set pipe on a 7,000-foot lateral, and we'll start to frac in a couple of weeks. As we complete these 2 wells and watch the offset activity, we continue to be very encouraged by the potential that we have on our legacy position for horizontal Cline and for multiple intervals of Wolfcamp development.", "I should also point out that we just finished a very successful vertical Wolfberry program this year at Conger, completing 14 wells. One of those wells was a successful step-out to the east side of Conger and is significant in that it sets up potential on the east side of the field.", "We believe the EURs on those 14 wells will be consistent with our previous estimates, and the well costs during the year were actually reduced to the $1.9 million range near the end of the program, thereby resulting in very good economics.", "Based on this performance, coupled with the step-out on east Conger, we could now have up to 1,000 potential Wolfberry wells at 20-acre spacing at Conger.", "Our production guidance for the fourth quarter has us right at the high end of our 20% to 25% year-over-year production guidance, which means the fourth quarter should be about 1 Bcf equivalent per day with 25% liquids. I'd like to point out that we're achieving the high end of our guidance, even though we sold approximately 18 million equivalent per day in production with the New Mexico properties earlier this year.", "Also of note in our guidance for the quarter, over half of the new Marcellus fourth quarter wells will be coming online in December and will not have much impact on our 2013 volumes.", "In closing, we're exceeding our operating targets. Production is growing at impressive rates, anchored by our growth in the Marcellus and expenses are falling. We have solid marketing and commercial arrangements in place in Appalachia to handle our growth for many years at attractive terms.", "We have approximately 1 million net acres in Pennsylvania positioned in the core, meaning both from a gas in place analysis and from a marketing standpoint. When you add up the stacked pay potential, we have more like 2 million net acres in the largest producing field in North America. We believe all of this positions us well to deliver 20% to 25% production growth at industry-leading returns, building shareholder value for many years.", "Now we're to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny", "Thank you, Ray.", "Over on the financial side, the third quarter was positive and predictable with another quarter of substantial cash flow growth, approved cash margins and continued unit cost expense reductions.", "Revenue from oil, gas and NGL sales, including cash settled derivatives, was $424 million, 20% higher than last year. Cash margins for the quarter of $2.74 per mcfe were up 7% from the third quarter last year and slightly higher than the second quarter of this year.", "Cash flow for the third quarter was $244 million, a 29% increase over last year's third quarter, while cash flow per fully diluted share came in at $1.51, 28% higher than the third quarter of 2012.", "Third quarter EBITDAX was $286 million, 24% higher than last year. GAAP net income was $19 million for the third quarter, while earnings calculated using analyst methodology, which excludes asset sales, derivative mark-to-market entries, various nonrecurring items, was $57 million or $0.35 per fully diluted share.", "As Rodney mentioned earlier, the non-GAAP measures I just mentioned are fully reconciled to GAAP on the various supplemental tables posted to the Range website under the Investor Relations tab.", "Looking briefly at our cost performance compared to guidance for the third quarter, all of the cost items came in at or below guidance.", "A few of the cost categories warranting special mention. Our third quarter direct operating expense at $0.34 in mcfe, which continues to fall as we build volumes in our low-cost, high-return Pennsylvania shale plays. Third-party transportation, gathering and compression unit cost was $0.69 for the third quarter. Approximately half the favorable variance to guidance, was due to higher volume utilization of existing facilities and the other half was due to a prior adjustment taken during the quarter.", "Fourth quarter should see this expense go back to the $0.77 to $0.79 per mcfe range, as additional capacity is added to accommodate future production growth.", "Year-to-date, our 6 major unit cost expense categories have declined approximately 9% below year-to-date 2012 levels. Expense guidance for the fourth quarter of this year is set forth in the earnings press release. And looking further out to 2014, we anticipate a reduction in unit cost expense for these same 6 categories of approximately 7%.", "There were no significant changes to the Range balance sheet during the third quarter. Though the income statement continues to benefit from the early 2013 refinancing of our higher cost senior subordinated notes into lower coupon notes with longer maturities.", "Just last week, the Range bank group unanimously reaffirmed our $2 billion credit facility borrowing base and $1.75 billion credit facility commitment, providing us approximately $1.2 billion in committed available liquidity and approximately $1.5 billion in total available liquidity under the borrowing base.", "The third quarter was an active one on the hedging front, as Range added to its 2013, 2014 and 2015 hedge position with additional natural gas, oil and NGL hedges, including propane and butane hedges. The Range website and press release tables contain detailed hedge volumes and prices that investors may use in preparing their estimates.", "In summary, the third quarter of 2013 was another solid quarter from a financial perspective, marked by higher production and continued expense control, driving improved cash margins and a 29% year-over-year increase in quarterly cash flow.", "Jeff, back over to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Real quickly, looking at the firm transport you added in Marcellus, it's now about 1.5 Bcf a day in 15, would certainly imply a growth trajectory north of 25% if we're just looking at filling those volumes versus FY '13 volumes. If I think about what you've outlined in the Miss and the Permian, it would seem that, that would certainly be putting you on a corporate production growth basis that would be towards the high end of that 20% to 25% for the future years. Can you help me understand why it wouldn't be traversing more towards the high end? Or why you're putting that kind of a range around it at this juncture?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. I mean, one, we're looking at long term. We really believe it will be 20% to 25% per year for many years. And by many years, we've said it in the past, we think we can double in 3 to 4 years, double again and beyond that. So I'm talking about for 5 to 10 years. For a long, long time, we think we have that kind of growth. And I think importantly, when you look at the gas in place maps in there that I think are significant, it's a new disclosure, it helps to really justify why we believe that. And there's a lot of data and a lot of control for that. So I'd spend some time looking at those, and we'll be glad to work with you on them. And then, what we look at are a variety of things. We look at oil and gas prices. We look at infrastructure buildout. We look at timing. Ray has talked a lot about the pace we've drilled at. And with the pace we've drilled at, how just consistently, year after year, the wells get better and better and better. And I think that will continue, so we really try to roll all those things together. And then the practicality of it is, we work on it. We present it to our board in December and come out with -- to the market sometime usually in late January, early February. But I do believe, we can grow for a long, long time at those rates. Some years, it will be at the high end. Other years, it may be in the middle or low end, and that's a function of product prices and timing and all kinds of other things.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "I appreciate that clarification. And then just thinking about the multi-stacked pays, sort of the gas in place that you talked about. You've outlined how capital efficiency benefits will come from that. When would we really start to see those capital efficiency benefits rule through? And what I mean by that is when do you think you'll be truly developing Upper Devonian or Utica, given that you're only scratching the surface in the Marcellus interval with about 7% of your identified locations drilled at this juncture? So I completely understand that, that drives capital efficiency growth in the long term. But in the short term, can we expect being able to leverage that stacked pay? Or is that something just to highlight longer-term inventory?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "This is Jeff. Let me start and I'm sure Ray or Roger or others will chime in. But one, I think it's really important to look back since we started. Again, I think you've seen capital efficiencies every year, you're right, though, driven by the Marcellus. So we've seen everything, not just production, climbing, but we've seen unit cost in really every single category start to come down. And that will continue on. But you're correct, when you start to add the other horizons, like Ray said, I think that will continue. In the short term, you'll see us -- by short-term, I'm talking about like 2014, a lot of the focus will continue to be on the Marcellus. But like Ray mentioned, and he can talk a little bit more in a minute, you'll see us come out and try a horizontal Utica well in Washington County next year. We're really excited by the prospect. And when you look at the gas in place maps for the Utica and zooming in on page -- if I can get there quickly on Page 13. When you look at the highest amount of gas in place, and we feel good about that, there's a number of control points from old existing wells or even coupled with the modern data and the well just offsetting us about a mile off of our -- the edge of our acreage that has a relatively high rate from a short lateral with not a lot of stages. We feel confident with those maps. So you'll see us try that next year and confirm that, that high rate production that we believe is there. And then you're probably start seeing in '15 and '16 a bigger mix of those types of wells.", "Ray N. Walker", "Dave, I agree totally with everything that Jeff said, but I want to go back and emphasize what he said earlier. I think we're already seeing a lot of that stuff hit the bottom line. Our unit costs, quarter-to-quarter, we're down, I think, 9%. Our operating expenses are down 15%. We've seen the cost of our facilities on our well sites decrease 15% just from the beginning of this year to today, we've seen our well costs come down and our well performance go up. We are -- at all times, in the Marcellus, we're beginning to go back in to some of these locations that already had the location built. The water impoundment's there. The facilities are already there. We're already doing that in a small way, as we go back in to drill additional 80-acre wells or maybe even to do additional infill well. So I think it's just going to be a gradual process, but we're still very much -- we've only drilled about 7% of the acreage, we've still got a long ways to go. But like Jeff said, we're going to be testing the Utica. We're really confident of what we're going to find there. We've already cracked the code on the Upper Devonian. So we just see a really -- a lot of durability and versatility in our story going forward. And I think that's the real story.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Appreciate that. And maybe just switching real quick to Miss, and I'll let somebody else hop on. When you look at doing these larger fracs there and -- obviously, early days, but increasing the uplift, relative to your previous wells, obviously, that drives the rate of return higher, which would probably put it above, certainly, what you're showing in the Marcellus since they're competitive right now. Does that mean that as we look towards '14, a larger percentage of your CapEx budget could be allocated to the Miss versus the kind of the 17% you're allocating currently?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, we're still -- I mean, it's a great question. And we are really, really encouraged by what we see so far. But again, this is only 4 wells. It's only 65 days online. We'll bring 4 more wells on with the same sort of designs in the fourth quarter. We simply need to see more production history on these wells to really understand it. And it's hard to say how long that's going to be, but until we get more data to really support our ability to allocate capital in the Mississippian, we're going to kind of stay at the mode we're at right now and doing some more -- we'll do some more delineation wells. Stepping out, we'll prove up some more areas, and we'll continue to evaluate the larger frac designs. But again, we are highly encouraged. I mean, everything we're seeing right now from the step-out well, from the larger fracs, everything looks really good. But this is still emerging and we'll consider all that when it comes time to recommend a budget to the board in December, and we'll go from there. And I'm sure, we'll announce it like we typically do in February of what our plans are.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just going back to the gas in place maps, can -- I mean, you obviously gave us a lot of color during the prepared remarks. But can you talk about how should we think about recovery factors within those? And I guess, we could go back and do a gas in place number for Range, specifically, but how should we think about just recovery factors in those 3 areas?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, that's a great question and it's something we talk about a lot at Range. First of all, I think the industry's ability to estimate the hydrocarbon in place is getting better and better as time goes on. I mean, typically in the past, we underestimated that. I think most of us in the industry, we believe, today, we're still underestimating it some. But we've also seen with the horizontal development, the RCS completions, the better frac designs, the better targeting, there's no doubt that we're pushing our recoveries up into the 30% range, maybe 35% range. But ultimately, there are -- probably, the shale with the most history is the Barnett, which is not really applicable or that analogous anymore to the Marcellus because it's so much better than the Marcellus. But you can see things, hear people talk about recoveries up in the 50% to 60% range. Certainly, we've seen that in unconventional reservoirs like the Cotton Valley and the Wilcox and the Almas [ph] and Jonah Field and places like that. So there's no question it's going to go up into those ranges. But how we get there, how long the laterals are, how close we space them together, do we put them in multiple intervals, all of those questions are yet to be determined. It will be years before we get to that point. But I think if you estimate something in the 25% to 35% range, you're going to cover most of what everybody believes today.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "This is Jeff. Let me throw a little more color on. These -- my gas in place maps -- and remember they're really hydrocarbon in place because liquids are gaseous in the reservoir. But when you look at the maps, you see clearly core spots, like on Slide 11 in the Marcellus, there's one in the northeast and one in the southwest. And the gas in place or hydrocarbon in place is really critical. The other key part of that would be in addition to the map is permeability, which this doesn't encompass. But it's interesting, that at least from my observations, the higher flow rates and the better permeability tend to be in areas where you have the maximum hydrocarbon in place. So I think the recovery factors, when you are in the core of the play -- and then back to that comment, it's really important where your acreage is or you're core or non-core. And that's true of the Barnett or Fayetteville or Haynesville or any play. So in the core, typically the recoveries are higher. And I think in the core parts of the plays, maybe they'll be pushed ultimately, like Ray said, to 40% of 50%. In the non-core areas, they may be very low. When you're out in the no-man's land somewhere, it may be 5% or 0% or -- so where you are in the plays is really critical. And again, I think that's why these maps are so important. If you think about hydrocarbon in place and then rock quality and where they are, were in the Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica, and then sum all 3 together on Slide 14, that's a bull's-eye right on top of our acreage. Going the other way, that's why we leased a lot of the acreage and why acquired and put our roots there.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And are you at -- I don't know, Ray or Jeff, whoever, are you at 30% today?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, the other part of that is -- and I'll turn it over to Alan in a minute, Alan Farquharson, who's our Senior Reservoir Engineer. We've drilled historically because we have such a big position. A lot of our wells are 1,000 feet apart. We announced last time that drilling the wells 500 feet apart that we think that's very successful as well and the recoveries may be on the order very high. They're in the book and you can look at them. We've had up to 3 years worth of history on our infills, so I think the 500-foot spacing will work. As well as -- or some of the other partners or not partners -- competitors, actually, in the area have drilled on 500-foot successfully as well. Peers is probably a better word. So it's not just Range that has said that. EQT has successfully drilled on tighter spacing and others. So I think it's a combination of drilling the wells on tighter spacing, 500-foot, say, or whatever it ends up being; better targeting; longer laterals; more RCS; those are the things that will tend to drive it higher. But let me turn it over to Alan.", "Alan W. Farquharson", "Dave, just to add on to Jeff's comments, it really comes down to, as he said, what your spacing is and how you're completing your wells, et cetera. When you get into these plays early on, I think everyone looks at a relatively low end, in terms of gas in place numbers or at least in terms of recovery factors. And then from there, as you continue to learn from it, you expand your recovery faster based upon well performance. What's great about these wells in the Marcellus is you can see that the ones that Ray alluded to on the call that we've updated performance on, these things are really, really flat in terms of well performance. So you're getting a significant contribution from a near wellbore. With that, we think where we currently are is probably, if you look at about 1,000-foot space in between wells in some of those estimates, the range of what you're given is probably reasonable for where we are in the Southwest. We think that with some of the recent productivity we've seen on our wells up in, like Lycoming County, we think that you're going to possibly see us a significantly higher recovery there, in terms of 1,000-foot spacing. So it's a range of outcomes more than anything else.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Alan, let me ask you a question. For the resource potential numbers that we have in our book for the Marcellus, what do you think the average recovery factor that we're currently using would be?", "Alan W. Farquharson", "For the resource potential that we're out, excluding the tighter spacing, we are probably in the 25% to 35% range, probably in the low-30s to the 35%. Then, as we added in the infill potential, we think that gets us up into the low- to mid-40s.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And my point being was leading question. The resource numbers that you'll see from us because we're in the areas of the high hydrocarbon in place and with the good permeability, the bias is those numbers will go up with time.", "David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's all great color. Let me just ask a second question and I'll let somebody else jump in. In your guidance section of the press release, the total wells planned to sell went up to 196 from, I think, it was 173 before. Is that -- and I talked with David about this a little bit last time, but is that just acceleration into '13? And if so, what's kind of going on there with the thought process there?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes. Most of that, David, is in the southern Marcellus. And it's the result of -- it is accelerating some wells, but it's because the guys are just getting way more efficient. They're drilling faster and completing faster. At more efficient use of their capital, they're able to put more wells online than we originally planned. So that's why I made real clear that statement that I said in my prepared remarks that more than or a lot of those wells were coming online in the month of December. They're not really going to impact our volumes at all this year. But the well count officially does go up because that's the way we track it, so it's just timing, more than anything.", "Operator", "And our question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "You talked about a Utica well, it sounded like in and around Washington County and it sounded like an industry well that de-risked the formation, at least in you all's mind. Can give a little bit more color here? And then obviously, you talked a lot about southwest PA, getting 540,000 acres. I mean, what percentage -- do you guys have any estimates on what percentage of that may ultimately be developed for the Upper Devonian and Utica?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, that's a great question, Leo. If you flip to Slide 31, you can see it sort of zooms in on our acreage position in and around Washington County. And when we map -- and the key well we're talking about there is that Chesapeake covered well, the 3H. So if you flip to Slide 31 for those of you that can do it real quick on your computers there, the Hubbard well is 1 mile west of our acreage. It's right on the western edge. It tested 11.1 million per day, with a lateral length of 2,900 feet and 8 frac stages, so that was a key test nearby. So you can envision that if you drilled, say, a 7,500-foot lateral or 7,000, 8,000-foot lateral, and you tripled the frac stages from 8 to 24, if it was proportional, that well would be over 30 million per day. Even if you pull it down a bit, you got 25 million to 30 million of per day type potential. A really important point, though, is that's a test nearby. There's other wells that were drilled historically in and around Washington County or, say, in Washington County, that we have control on that were drilled for -- they're old Trenton-Black River tests or deeper tests to give us control points and relatively modern logs to know what the Utica/Point Pleasant thickness is, what the porosity is, what the water saturation is, what the reservoir pressure is. All those types of things that you use for math to get gas in place.", "So when you take all that data -- plus we have a 3D seismic over basically a lot of that acreage. So when you take all that and you integrate that in -- back on Slide 13, you can see that the big bull's-eye, the big red and orange area really lays -- it's across our acreage there. So we have a lot of historical well control in Washington County to generate the map on Slide 13. Then you come back to the Slide on 31, and now we have a recent modern horizontal test. Although it's a very short lateral with not a lot of stages, it had a pretty impressive IP. So back with more optimally targeting the well into the thicker, higher gas in place, we think is better rock quality. We think we have wells that could be 25 million, 30 million per day, if we're successful there and when we get a big acreage position. And then it rolls back into all the comments Ray said. One, is we drill Marcellus wells, which are low risk. We're holding all the depth rights. We're holding up for Devonian, Marcellus and Utica, as well as everything else. And then we have roads infrastructures, gathering and all those types of things. So there'll be the economies of scale. So we look forward to next year to drilling and testing that, and then, ultimately, in 2015 and beyond, starting to roll some of the Utica and Upper Devonian back into our plans.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Great. Really helpful color here. I guess, is there, based on your mapping and the logs you've seen -- people have drilled through the Utica. I mean, is there kind of a ballpark kind of amount of target acreage? Is it safe to say something like more than half of your acres [indiscernible] perspective, can you throw out any color [ph] about stuff like that?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Sure, go back to Slide 10 and we tried to do that there. When you look at that dry acreage, we think 400,000 acres of that is perspective. So the orange and red blobs, ultimately, will correspond to about 400,000 acres. 400,000 acres with all that gas in place and you multiply it out and then put a recovery factor on it. If you've noticed, we do not have any Utica resource potential. I think you'll see that come in, in a big way and verified by the well that we'll drill next year.", "Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, just jumping over to transportation. Obviously, guys, you focused a lot of that in your press release and your prepared comments. Can you just maybe just talk about sort of your longer-term transportation goals? I mean, do you guys intend to get a lot of the gas kind of out of the basin, potentially go into the Midwest, Midcon or Southeast? And can you maybe talk about how you see that trending over time in terms of you all's goals?", "Chad L. Stephens", "Leo, this is Chad. Thanks for the question. As we've seen the play grow and the volume of gas grow, we've focused on diversity, diversity pipelines and transportation, markets and buyers, and how we sell our gas, what industries we sell our gas into that spreads our risk and spreads our opportunity. So yes, we're now looking outside the basin, have been for quite a while, looking to the Midwest and the Southeast. And as we do so and layer in firm transportation, you'll see more of our gas sold at indices outside of the Appalachian basin.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Matt Portillo from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Two quick questions for me. Just back to the Marcellus for a second. With the multiple stacks potential, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about kind of planned pad development. And ultimately, as you guys look at the multitude of horizons here, how you may adjust the number of wells per pad or how that may improve some of the drilling efficiencies you guys are seeing? And then I have a second follow-up question just in regards to your Permian acreage and some of the drilling you're doing there.", "Ray N. Walker", "Sure, Matt. It's a good question. We typically design these pads for more wells than we actually drill, the first pass-through. We will typically drill anywhere from 2 up to 6 wells per pad in today's world. That's trying to optimize our capital efficiency and that we get economies of scales, the more wells we put on a pad. But yet we're still trying to build infrastructure and delineate all of those different issues by stepping out as much as we can and doing that. As we go back, we have the ability to put a whole lot of wells on there. And I don't know if we could quote a number today because we've had various evolutions of designs as we go forward. But I think there will be a point in time where you could have 20, 30, 40 wells on a pad. There's no question about that. The real technology breakthrough that we need going forward is the ability to do multiple laterals out of a single wellbore. That technology does exist today, but it's extremely expensive. It's just simply cheaper to start over and drill a new grassroots vertical for each well today. But I think there's no doubt that, that's coming down the road. And what the good news is, in our overall long-term design -- and again, I can't stress this enough. We look at this project, really, for a long, long term going forward, 10, 15, 20 years out, because we think we have the resource potential as we've continued to demonstrate with gas in place maps. We keep rolling out more information as we gain confidence in history and have become very confident of what we're putting out there, that we can actually grow this for many years. So that's in all of our plans for midstream infrastructure, whether it's compressors, whether it's processing plants, how we power those compressor stations and processing plants. We're looking at how we would stack wells together, how we would handle condensate on these well site facilities. All of that's going into that plan. So to answer your question, although I can't give you a black-and-white answer, is it's a lot of wells.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And a second follow-up question, just in regards to your Permian drilling program, could you give us a little bit of color on, I guess, just around the acreage that you have in kind of the southern Glasscock area. And then as you guys mentioned, kind of the step-out Wolfberry test, I wanted to know kind of the implication on the number of locations. I think you guys mentioned up to 1,000 locations on 20-acre spacing, and how you may be able to accelerate development if that's kind of successful with incremental delineation here?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, let me -- on Page 67 in our presentation, for those of you that can, is a good map showing that. But we have about 100,000 acres -- 90,000 to 100,000 acres, that's all HBP. It's the legacy position. We've got hundreds of wells across it. We've tested virtually all the intervals, pretty much all across the field now at one time or another. Our Wolfberry program this year, we allocated it some additional capital out there. They were making really good progress. I think the wells were -- we were projecting the EURs over 200 Mboe for about $2.3 million. In 14 wells this year, they drove the cost down to less than $2 million down to $1.9 million range and the EURs look like they're going to be at expectations, if not better. So that was a really successful program. One of those wells -- typically, we've shown the Wolfberry potential, on Page 68, as the west edge of that field. One of those wells that we drilled this year was over in the east side. And it's turned out to be a really decent well. We've still got some things to figure out. There's no doubt about. It's one well. It's early, but we think it now potentially opens up 800 more locations. There were 200 20-acre wells on the west side, so this could open up the rest of the field. We say that because we've got so much log data and historical information as we've drilled through it in the years past. As far as the Cline and the Wolfcamp, we potentially have Wolfcamp horizontal potential in multiple Wolfcamp intervals. We're watching that actively closely to the west of us there. And some to the south, there's been some impressive completions. It's very early in the play. We are watching it. The good news is, is all the operators out there, our peers, are trading data and we're all learning from each other as we go. And we felt good enough about it that we've drilled, now, a 7,000-foot Cline, which we're really encouraged by. I mean, we haven't seen any of the wells clean up like this, this early. Our first 3 wells, we were in the 30% to 40% recovery before we saw any real oil or gas production. This well was showing it at 5% or 6%. So pressure's climbing, oil rate's climbing, gas rate's climbing. So we're really excited about this, and hopefully, we can talk about a lot of good news the next time we release information about that well and the Wolfcamp. So it's really encouraging. We think the Cline is perspective across the entire acreage position. And the Wolfcamp, I mean, we just need to get some wells completed and determine that. But again, we have vertical penetrations through it all across the field. So it's pretty encouraging. It's pretty exciting. So we're going to see how these wells do. We'll give it some time, watch the production history, evaluate what we believe we could drive the cost down to, and it may be competitive once we get to that point. But chances are, it can be a really, really good oil play for us.", "Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And just last question there. In regards to that eastern Wolfberry well, is it fair to assume that it was performing fairly close to your western position, as you mentioned kind of encouraging results initially?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes. That's fair. Yes.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein.", "Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Had a couple quick ones. One was going back to those beautiful gas in place maps. You're drawing that 1,050-BTU contour. If I look at the Upper Devonian, I would've thought that would be further to the east since it's stratigraphically higher? Are you being conservative? Is there potential for more wet gas in that Upper Devonian?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, the Upper Devonian's only somewhere between 300- and 500-foot shallower than the Marcellus, so from an age standpoint, it's not that much different. So it may be a shift to the -- very slightly, but it's very slightly if at all. Also remember, we've got almost as much information on the Upper Devonian as we do the Marcellus because every time we drill a Marcellus well, we drill through the Upper Devonian. We get a really good indication how thick it is, what's there, every time we go through it. And we've done enough testing now, and us and our peers across the basin, I think, we've got a real good confirmation of those analyses that we've performed to date. So we feel pretty confident in that Upper Devonian map. I mean, there's a lot of data behind that and it should hold up really well.", "Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "The follow-up is kind of further down the road. Have you guys given any thought to how you might develop some of the more Pittsburgh metropolitan area? I mean, clearly, you've had experience in the Barnett in a pretty densely populated area?", "Ray N. Walker", "The short answer is no. We're not going there. We don't really have experience in the Barnett. I mean, Range never did that in the urban areas, per se. And I don't know -- I mean, there's still a moratorium on drilling inside the Pittsburgh City limits. So I can't imagine anybody wanting to tackle that. The urban development, coupled with the surface topography and all that, it's just going to be a nightmare. So trust me, I used to live there.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I grew up there. Pittsburgh's a lot older city. It's a lot more urbanized. And we have such a great position in areas where we can operate. So we're going to stay focused where we are.", "Operator", "We are nearing the ends of today's conference. We will go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America for our final question.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I want to go back to the 500-foot spacing question, if I may. I wanted to try and understand what this means in terms of your development plan. I know that you're HBP acreage is essentially done. The 80% interference number, I guess, an 80% EUR number, I guess, it was mentioned in the prior presentations. How should we think about the primary development pattern? Are you going after the 1,000-foot first and then do the infills? Or what's the implication if you do the 500-foot from the get-go? And I've got a quick follow-up please.", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, that's a really interesting question. And to answer your question, we're probably going to do both over the next couple of years. We're actually going back into -- next year into couple of locations to drill some 500-foot infills. So I think several months after we bring those wells online, we'll have data to talk about. We're also going to be looking at some 500-foot grassroots developments. There's a lot of advantages, potentially, to that in that you get a better, more complex fracturing network when you frac the wells closer together, stress shadowing and some of those impacts can be a real positive influence on your results. So we're really interested in all that, and we're starting to develop those things. We took a lot of time to look at our 500-foot spaced wells versus the 1,000-foot spaced wells before we came out with that data earlier this year because we wanted to have a high degree of confidence in what we were putting out. So we feel really confident in those numbers, but again, there could be a lot more potential upside. And again, we only put out data for the wet and super-rich. We will be working on the dry area, too, just to see if -- what the numbers look like there.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My follow-up, I guess, my last question. No one has really talked about the Mississippian too much today. I'm just wondering if you could -- I know you've gone back to the more aggressive fracs. How are you feeling about how that asset has now been de-risked relative to your expectations? And I leave it there.", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, earlier this year, as all our teams are focused very much on lowering costs and becoming more capital efficient. Earlier this year, we tried some smaller frac jobs and, of course, we talked about on the last call how the results didn't look that good. We've now gone back to pumping a much larger fracs and those wells look really, really encouraging. We're pretty excited about it. And -- but again, it's only 4 wells. It's only 65 days. But they're substantially above the 600 Mboe curve. We did a step-out well that's got really, really good oil production. It's about 85% oil, which is way higher than anything else we've seen. Even with these larger fracs, we're keeping our well costs flat at $3.2 million, and I expect the team will be real successful even driving that down. So we think the play has got a lot of potential. It could be a really nice oil play at 4,500-foot or less. In Oklahoma, I mean, it just doesn't get a lot better than that. So we're pretty excited about it. The team up there is pretty excited. They're doing a great job. But again, we just need more time. We need to make sure that, like we do in all our plays, like we've done in the Marcellus and everywhere we've worked, we try to make really data-based decisions, performance-based and it's all about performance and reserve growth per share and keeping our cost structure low. And all of those things are really important to us, and so were going to take our time and make sure that play is emerging for us. But all indications at this point are really good.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Jeff, is the Woodford perspective on your acreage?", "Ray N. Walker", "I'm sorry, you broke up on the first part of that?", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'm sorry. Is the Woodford perspective in your Mississippian acreage?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, there is a some perspective Woodford, especially on the southern end of our acreage. We haven't tested that yet but we're monitoring some offset activity. I think Devon has drilled some wells and there may be a few others now that I hadn't kept up with. But our team up there is watching that really closely, and we may test that at some point.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session.", "I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "As I stated at the beginning of the call, Range has a very simple story. Given Range's large, high-quality, low-risk acreage position and drilling inventory, we continue to believe that we have 20% to 25% line-of-sight growth for many years. Led by our approximately 1 million net acre position in Pennsylvania, we project that we'll consistently drive up both production and reserves on a per-share basis, net adjusted for years to come. We believe that this plan will translate into substantial shareholder value in the months and years ahead.", "Rodney just let me know that there's still at least 15 more people on there that have questions, so I'd encourage you to follow up with our IR team, and we want to get all those questions answered.

Looking ahead, we believe that we have the wells identified, the compression and plants planned for, and the takeaway capacity lined up to profitably grow our production to greater than 3 Bcfe per day. The plan is further de-risked given that assuming current strip pricing and differentials, we project that we can be cash flow positive in 2016 and that our planned growth beyond that can be within cash flow. Importantly, we project that we will continue to grow 20% to 25% in 2016 and beyond, and gas demand is projected to grow significantly from LNG exports, petrochemical, power generation, manufacturing and transportation growth.", "As we continue to improve our drilling and completion technology, including drilling longer laterals with more frac stages, our capital efficiency continues to improve. For the second half of 2014, we plan to drill Marcellus wells that are projected to have an average lateral length of 5,413 feet, some with laterals over 10,000 feet. On our first quarter conference call in April, it was great to announce that Range has just drilled what we believe is the highest rate Marcellus well ever drilled by any company in the southwest portion of the play. That will had an initial 24 hour rate of 38.1 million equivalent per day. This well had its 7,065-foot lateral completed with 36 stages and it's located in Washington County, Pennsylvania.", "This quarter, I'm excited to announce that we drilled and completed our best well ever on our northeast acreage position. This well had an initial rate of 28 million per day from a 6,553-foot lateral with 33 stages. It could have IP-ed for a much higher rate, but was constrained by our surface facilities. This well set a new 30-day production record for Range and average 25 million per day for this period. This well has been online now for 40 days and is still producing 22 million per day. The cost of drilling to complete this well was $5.2 million. They have multiple potential offsets to the well.", "We expect to see capital and operating efficiencies build in the future from other areas. In the next 3 years, our land budget in the Marcellus is projected to decline significantly. This year, land is about 14% of our total capital budget. In 2017, it's projected to be about 5% of our capital budget. Unit costs are expected to continue to decline as we build scale and spread our already low cost across a larger production base. Importantly, Range has the largest net acreage position in Pennsylvania, with what we think has the best stacked pay potential. We believe we can grow annual production rates at 20% to 25% for many years, with net production of approximately 1.1 Bcfe per day net. Going on a compounded basis, our net production should double every 3 to 4 years. We have the potential to grow 1.1 Bcf per day to greater than 3 Bcf per day. For investors who stated that we have resource life of 100 years today, we believe we can drive that down to about 30 years in the next few years, and we should generate a lot of value pulling that forward.", "As we have seen repeatedly, marketing is the key to success in the Marcellus. Importantly, our marketing team is well coordinated with our operations teams. We currently move our gas on 11 different interstate pipelines into 21 different indices. Range has the most diverse portfolio of interstate pipeline firm transportation arrangements with some of the lowest cost per MCF direct-to-markets with strong demand. We have recently announced new long-term transportation of sales agreements that are aligned with our growth.", "We continue to expand selling natural gas in the eastern, southern and midwestern areas of the U.S., as well as selling natural gas to international LNG customers. Our ethane will be sold in the U.S., Canada and Europe, and our propane will be sold in the northeastern and midwestern U.S. and international markets. I believe that Range's ethane portfolio is the best in the business. Next year, when all 3 projects are online, selling ethane for us is projected to be greater than a 25% uplift in ethane revenue versus selling the ethane as gas and receiving the Btu credit.", "Turning to new developments in the first half of this year. We're currently drilling our first Utica well in Washington County. Our hope is that this well will unlock the Utica potential in our acreage in Southwest Pennsylvania. We currently have 400,000 perspective net acres that appear to be located in the core of the Utica with the highest resource in place.", "As we previously reported, we closed our asset exchange with ETP in mid-June. We believe that we created a lot of value by combining together both halves of the Nora field. In the southern part of the Appalachian Basin, combining our Nora assets with our other assets in this division, we now have 111 million cubic feet per day of net production, 475,000 net acres, 1,500 miles of pipelines and 85,000 horsepower of compression. We own the royalty under the vast majority of this production in acreage. We believe there's great upside to these properties and that we have the potential to grow this division to more than 500 million per day. This division alone has a deeper inventory and longer track record than many start-up companies.", "We continue to make progress in the Horizontal Mississippian Chat play. If you look at the horizontal wells with our original completion designs and also our current completion designs, we're projecting EURs with greater than 485,000 Boe. We plan to continue to drill and delineate our Mississippian Chat acreage through the end of the year. The wells turned to sales in this quarter have the highest average IP rates than any other quarter.", "As I mentioned on previous calls, in order to create significant value over time, the ability to execute well is vital for any company in our industry. This quarter was another great example of Range overcoming difficult circumstances despite MarkWest having a 200 million per day processing plant go down for 5 weeks in the quarter, due to severe weather. Thanks to the extraordinary effort for many members of our team and the MarkWest team, we were still able to exceed production guidance for the quarter. Congratulations to Ray, John Mike and our many dedicated employees who made this happen.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.", "Ray N. Walker", "Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with our Southern Marcellus Shale division. When you consider our 530,000 net acre position in Southwest Pennsylvania, which includes Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian, we effectively have about 1.4 million acres to develop. Even without the stacked pay, this is the largest net acreage position in the southwest portion of the basin, and it's a high-quality position where the majority is core, meaning it's in the highest hydrocarbon in place of the basin for the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian. It's also the highest quality acreage from a well performance standpoint in that we have the highest EUR per foot of lateral in the Marcellus in the southwest portion of the basin.", "To expand on that point, I'll discuss a couple of recent examples. Right before the last call, the team completed a 5-well pad in our super-rich Marcellus area. One of those wells had a 24 hour IP of 38.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 6,357 Boe per day with 65% liquids, and is the largest reported IP in the southwest portion of the basin. The 5 wells on that pad under constrained conditions had an average 30-day rate to sales of 2,113 Boe per day per well, and averaged 6,634-foot laterals with 34 stages. It's early, but the wells are estimated to have an average EUR per well of 16.3 Bcf equivalent, which translates to about 2.5 Bcf equivalent per thousand-foot of lateral. These wells are the best liquids-rich wells in the basin and are great examples of longer laterals combined with our latest targeting and completion designs.", "Using all our current commercial terms, deducts and strip pricing, the return on these wells is approximately 140% with a PV-10 of almost $25 million for each well. Another example in southwest PA in our dry area, we recently completed a 3-well pad that averaged 48 million a day combined for the first 30 days, again, under surface facility constraints. The wells had average lateral lengths of 4,768 feet with 25 stages, and our early estimate of the average EUR per well is 17 Bcf or 3.6 Bcf per thousand-foot of lateral. Again, using all the current terms, deducts and strip pricing, the return on these wells is over 185% with a PV-10 of over $19 million each. These wells are clearly some of, if not, the best wells in the dry area of the southwest portion of the play, even though they're about half the lateral length than some of our offset competitors.", "We're also seeing capital and operational efficiencies in southwest Pennsylvania continue to improve. Before I get into some specific examples, I want to point out that these efficiencies are driving improvements at the bottom line and we believe that the improvements will continue. This is a real testament to the incredible team that we have in place.", "On the completion side, we've safely executed 18% more stages in the second quarter of this year as compared to last year, and additionally, we see an 8% increase in the number of stages per day. This improvement in efficiency in just a year's time is really a nice accomplishment when you consider we utilized the same number of frac produce and are effectively pumping the same size, if not larger, jobs. Over the last 5 years, we've seen a 70% improvement in completion efficiency and again, we believe those efficiencies will continue to improve.", "On the drilling side in southwest Pennsylvania, we have achieved a 9% reduction in cost per foot this year as compared to 2013. And we fully expect that the drilling cost reduction will easily exceed 10% for 2014. Over the past 2 years, we're drilling 46% longer laterals at a 32% reduced cost per lateral foot. Essentially, we're drilling more complex wells at a significantly lower cost per lateral foot, and again, we believe this trend will continue. In the second half of 2014, we expect to drill laterals that are approximately 12% longer than those drilled in the first half of the year and longer than were in our original 2014 plan.", "Just to point out a few examples of those remaining in our 2014 drilling schedule, we have 9 wells planned between 6,000 and 7,000-foot of lateral length, 4 between 7,000 and 8,000, 4 more between 8,000 and 9,000, and 4 laterals that are currently targeted to average over 11,450 feet. We've also increased our lateral lengths for 2015, and you can find those on our updated presentation.", "As Jeff pointed out in his remarks, we're currently drilling the Utica well in Washington County, Pennsylvania and the plan is to drill a 6,500-foot lateral and complete it with a 32 stage completion. We spud the well back in April with the shallow rig to do the top well work, and we recently moved in the big rig and everything is on track for a production test in the fourth quarter. And recent offset activity continues to be very encouraging, as we believe we could have some of the highest gas in place for the dry Utica beneath our core Marcellus and Upper Devonian acreage.", "In summary, we have an acreage position in southwest Pennsylvania alone that, by itself, is larger than most of our peers and is in what we believe to be the highest hydrocarbon resource in place in the basin. If you look at our southwest Pennsylvania position as a standalone company, the compounded annual growth rate for the past 5 years is over 73%. We're continuing to drill longer and longer laterals while still maintaining or improving our recoveries, and our capital efficiency metrics are continuing to improve with what we see is a lot of upside yet to recognize.", "Shifting to northeast Pennsylvania. We have approximately 110,000 net acres with 3D seismic that has helped our production with a limited drilling program and ready to ramp up when the time is right. What's exciting about this area is that we continue to develop exceptional dry gas wells as we described in the earnings release.", "Following up on that thought, we had a new pad in Lycoming County in the second quarter that averaged 6,086-foot laterals with 31 stages. It's early, but we believe those wells have an average EUR of over 16.5 Bcf each or 2.7 Bcf per thousand-foot of lateral. With an average well cost of approximately $5 million, those wells achieve a return of 151% with a PV-10 of $16 million each. Again, at all the current commercial terms, deducts and strip pricing.", "The well cost in our Northern Marcellus Shale Division are 27% less than a year ago with 34% longer laterals taking approximately 10% less time to drill. That translates to a 21% decrease in cost per foot drilled. These are outstanding metrics, and my congratulations to the Northern Marcellus Shale Division team. Improvements like these really drive capital efficiency, and I'm confident our team can continue to deliver even more going forward.", "Before I leave the Marcellus, I've given you 3 great examples of exceptional well performance and economics from both southwest and northeast Pennsylvania, from both wet and dry gas areas. While these 3 pads are better than our average well, I want to make the point that we do believe that these 3 pads represent tangible, repeatable and achievable upside that we can expect to see going forward on a large portion of our acreage. As we drill longer laterals and continue to improve targeting, improve our completion designs and apply new technologies across our Marcellus areas, we believe results like these 3 pads will become more and more prevalent. And as I've often said, while results like these are very impressive, we still don't believe we drilled our best wells yet.", "For the Mid-continent Division, we remain focused on our continued effort to delineate and test our Mississippian Chat acreage on the Nemaha Ridge, along with developing our St. Louis production in the Texas Panhandle. For the chat, we're continuing with our current completion designs in conjunction with improved geologic targeting.", "We announced our record oil well, which yielded our highest oil rate to-date in the chat at the last call. To follow-up on that well, over the first 90 days of production, the well has averaged over 400 barrels of oil per day. Additionally, this past quarter, we achieved the highest average IP rate for chat wells turned to sales in any one quarter to-date. While it's still early, the results are encouraging and our expectations for EURs in the chat remains greater than 485 Mboe.", "Moving to the Southern Appalachian Division. With the recent exchange completed, Range has increased the division's capital budget from $20 million to $40 million by moving the remaining planned capital from Conger to Nora. The division will focus this capital on high rate of return projects that will include drilling vertical tight gas, CBM and horizontal shale wells, along with recompletion of approximately 20 CBM wells designed to target bypass pay.", "As a side note, there are additional 500 or more candidates just like these. Numerous smaller scale projects are also planned in the short-term to optimize existing production with a very modest capital spend. Over the next 18 months, we plan approximately 50 CBM wells, 30 tight gas vertical wells and about 20 horizontal Huron Shale wells, combined with a total of 75 CBM recompletions and as many as 30 tight gas recompletions. All of these at very attractive and competitive economics with returns up to 100%.", "The Southern Appalachian team is also introducing some new techniques and well designs resulting in improved well performance. In the second quarter, Range drilled one of its best vertical tight gas wells in over 5 years in Nora. This well has produced at an average rate of 1 million a day for the past 35 days, and we estimate an EUR of 1.5 Bcf for only $430,000, yielding a return of over 100% with a finding cost of $0.30. Again, we own the royalty under a large portion of the field.", "We also believe there is significant deep potential below the Huron and only a couple of wells in Nora have gone below the Devonian Shale to-date. We estimate that there's an additional 6,000 to 8,000 feet of untested rock below the Huron, and are looking forward to studying that further in the coming years.", "In the Southern Appalachian region, demand continues to increase with over 3 Bcf a day of new gas-fired electric generation expected to come online over the next 5 years. Nora is strategically located to supply these gas markets in tandem with the Marcellus, allowing us to establish a new and long-term customer base with supporting infrastructure, thereby yielding us a strategic and competitive advantage. The well-defined, large and de-risked inventory of projects, which totals over 5 Tcf of resource potential in the Southern Appalachian Division, coupled with the large gathering system and expanding demand in the region, give us confidence that we can significantly ramp up production in the coming years with economics that are very strong even relative to the Marcellus.", "On the marketing side of things, the midstream industry recognizes the dramatic volume growth coming from the Marcellus and the Utica plays, and there have been numerous announcements of brownfield reversal and greenfield pipeline projects to move this growing volume from the northeast to other markets. By 2018, it's projected that over 13 Bcf a day of announced projects will be in service. Range is participating in several of these projects, which are designed to move our gas from the northeast directly to the areas that are projecting the increases in demand and prices, especially in the Gulf Coast and southeast regions where -- which are driven by new gas-fired electric generation and expanding petrochemical industry and LNG exports, which alone are expected to represent 6 to 8 Bcf per day of new demand.", "Also, given that we're the largest liquids producer in the basin with the richest gas, we also continue to actively build our portfolio of liquids contracts and customers while expanding export opportunities and capturing favorable pricing, and we believe our liquids portfolio is one of the very best.", "In addition to all the great work that our marketing team has accomplished in providing a diverse portfolio of customers and transportation outlooks at some of the best commercial terms in the industry, I want to also congratulate the operating and financial teams for their work in lowering our unit costs by 11%, which is a decrease of $0.41 per Mcfe as compared to last year. This cost discipline is a core value at Range and one that is impactful, and showing up at the bottom line.", "In closing, we have a great team, a great portfolio of projects and a track record of execution coupled with a great marketing team that has put together a strategy that has optionality, low cost and durability, all of which will help us build shareholder value going forward.", "Now over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny", "Thank you, Ray. From a financial perspective, the second quarter was very successful. We had our production numbers despite 2 unexpected events, our unit costs were reduced significantly. The Nora Conger asset exchange was completed with the teams now substantially integrated. And we strengthened our balance sheet, providing our operating teams a competitive advantage in executing their long-term growth strategies.", "Second quarter revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales, including cash and oil derivatives, was $451 million, 9% higher than last year. Cash margin for the quarter was $2.45 per Mcfe, down 10% from the second quarter of last year, with over 2/3 of the decline due to the nonrecurring top line revenue issues, further described in the earnings release.", "Second quarter cash flow was $249 million, 10% higher than last year's second quarter, while EBITDAX for the quarter was $292 million, 8% higher than last year. Cash flow per fully diluted share was 9% higher than last year at $1.53 per share.", "Reported net income for the second quarter was $171 million compared to $144 million in net income from last year. The second quarter of both this year and last year were positively impacted by gains on asset sales. Earnings calculated using the methodology used by most analysts, which excludes asset sales, mark-to-market hedging entries and various nonrecurring items, was $59 million or $0.36 per fully diluted share, up 6% from last year's second quarter. All the GAAP -- non-GAAP measures that I just mentioned are fully reconciled to GAAP on the various supplemental tables that you may find on the Range website.", "The second quarter continued the positive trend toward lower unit costs in the operating expense categories. Though faced with some tough operating challenges during the quarter, all of the expense categories came in below guidance. Total unit costs in the second quarter, including DD&A, were a full $0.41 below the total unit cost in the second quarter of last year. While a quarterly swing in gas basis of this amount seems to get everyone's attention these days, this $0.41 reduction in unit cost creates enduring value as it demonstrates our continuing operating efficiencies and growing economies of scale in our core areas.", "The story doesn't end with our cash operating costs. Our capital cost efficiency also continues to improve. The second quarter DD&A rate per Mcfe was $1.33, down 8% from the second quarter of last year and down 41% from 5 years ago. We believe that our capital and operating efficiency will continue to improve while buildings scale on our core areas. And we anticipate our DD&A will decline another $0.03 in the third quarter to approximately $1.30 in Mcfe, followed by yet another step down in the fourth quarter following completion of our year-end reserve report.", "There was one expense category that was so far below guidance that it merits further explanation. Cash transportation, gathering and compression expense per Mcfe was $0.76 for the quarter compared to guidance of $0.86 to $0.88. As explained on the first quarter call, the reason for the higher second quarter guidance was the cost of additional long-term firm pipeline capacity that was procured in advance of anticipated production volumes. Up to the extent we have firm capacity in excess of our production volumes, and we elect to market this capacity under short-term arrangements, the excess from capacity expense is reclassified to the broker natural gas and marketing expense line, rather than in transportation and gathering expense line. Approximately half of the $0.10 guidance beat in transportation and gathering expense is from the reclassification of this expense from the transportation line to the brokerage line. The other half of the guidance beat was due to actual better perform -- than projected cost performance.", "Now thanks to the efforts of our marketing team, a significant portion of the excess capacity expense rebooked to the brokerage expense line, was eliminated by remarketing the capacity to others, and we believe that we'll be able to cover this cost in the third quarter until we need the capacity in the future.", "Now please reference our second quarter earnings release for additional detailed expense item guidance for the upcoming third quarter.", "The balance sheet was significantly strengthened during the second quarter to $146 million in asset sale proceeds, $171 million in net income and retirement of $300 million in high-cost 8% debt. These actions reduced our debt-to-book capitalization ratio from 57% at year-end to 48%, and our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio from 2.8x to 2.4x at June 30. Our leverage is no longer an outlier for a BB-rated company and we have accomplished our goal of reducing leverage. With annual cash flow projected to increase faster than debt, based on current prices, our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio should decline below 2x within 2 years. And the repositioning of our balance sheet during the second quarter will continue to produce operating performance benefits, such as the multiple long-term natural gas and NGL firm capacity agreements that we announced on June 26.", "We added additional price protection, including basis hedges during the second quarter, higher production volumes hedge for natural gas, oil and NGLs in 2014, 2015 and 2016. The Range released 10-Q and Investor Relations tables posted in the Range website all contain additional detailed hedge volumes and prices by product.", "In summary, thanks to the hard work of our people and our diverse portfolio of drilling and marketing options, we were able to hit our production targets in the second quarter, while also lowering our operating and capital unit cost. With the nonrecurring operating issues behind us, we look forward to a second half of the year marked by disciplined production growth, double-digit year-over-year cash flow growth and continued cost structure improvements.", "Jeff, I'll turn it back to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Real quickly, just looking at how the gas mix creeps in the second half of 2014, obviously, some restructuring on your portfolio is contributing to that. But can you talk about how that mix creeps as you tend towards your path of 3 Bcf a day by the end of the decade?", "Ray N. Walker", "Dave, this is Ray. That's a good question and you nailed it. I mean, the big 2 reasons are: Number one, of course, the asset exchange that we did, Conger for Nora, going forward is going to change the mix significantly. The other thing that's kind of happened in the background more or less is that we've made some really great dry gas wells, and those wells are producing well. The super-rich and wet wells, as we go in longer and longer laterals and making better and better wells, they make an awful lot of gas also. So I think going forward, once you see how this year kind of pans out through the rest of the year, I think directionally that's probably where we'll be for quite a while. I mean, we're certainly going to focus on super-rich and wet. But the thing to remember, I'll pull you back to, is that we've got a great portfolio, and we can choose to go dry, we can choose to go wet or super-rich, northeast PA versus southwest, and we have that optionality going forward. And it's -- they're big areas, core hydrocarbon in place-type areas that give us really attractive economics going forward, and the ability to switch as markets change.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Okay, I appreciate that. And then one of the things you guys outlined in your presentation was you've added a bunch of transportation capacity through 2018. It looks like costs, at least as you guys are outlining, is about $0.39 a nab or MMBtu. Can you talk about that in terms of your view on where you think basis differentials will be on a longer-term basis out of kind of the northeast and southwest? I imagine you think they're going to be wider than that and so I'm just trying to get color around that.", "Chad L. Stephens", "Yes. Hey Dave, this is Chad. Yes, we've tried to -- with the newer slide, we tried to give a little bit more clarity and transparency about our plans to market our gas. We view the regional weakness in the northeast as somewhat temporary. Ray talked about the bidirectional flow projects that are going to by 2018 be in service, about 13 Bcf a day. And once those projects are in service, we think basis in the northeast will form up or settle out a little bit. We don't know exactly where that will be, but I'm going to say probably somewhere well below $1. But when you look at our firm transportation portfolio, we want to get to what we deem to be the stronger markets, Gulf Coast, where LNG exports somewhere between 6 and 8 Bcf a day, in the midwest over the Chicago, Michigan, dawn [ph] areas where, if you look at the forward curves there, they're still relatively strong, NYMEX flat to maybe plus a little bit. So we've layered in these firm transportation arrangements and what we think are really great cheap, relatively cheap cost to these markets that we think, in the years to come, are going to be relatively strong given that demand that we see is there and needs to be served.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "I appreciate that clarification. One last one, if I might. You outlined tremendous completion efficiency and drilling efficiency gains. Can you quantify that in terms of the dollars saved over the last year relative to those efficiency gains? And maybe, if you can, put that or juxtapose that to what's happened with dollars absorbed from basis differentials. It seems like there's probably a pretty good offset or maybe even a better offset from these completion efficiency and drilling efficiency gains.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, David. This is Ray. That's a great point. When we look at each year and we do our reviews with the divisions and look at all the different technologies they are trying in frac design, the different things they're doing, you really look at it from 2 sides. You look at it from a well performance side. We try to measure quality and things like EUR per thousand-foot of lateral, and that's not the only thing. But we certainly look at things like that, but we also look at, when we set the budget at the end of one year going into next year, the completions team, for example, will have said, we're going to spend x million dollars completing wells in 2014. I can tell you that we've seen improvements just this year that probably are carving in the range of $40 million to $50 million off of that type of total number. And what we do is basically feed that number back into our capital budget. Basically, they use it to frac more stages, do more wells. It just kind of goes back into the till for that division. And those improvements are substantial, and I think that there's a lot of room going forward like we've seen for it to continue.", "I think a lot of that is because we've just got an exceptional team. I think a lot of it also is that we're in exceptional rock. We've got the best parameters, porosity, perm, pressures, those kind of things that when targeting makes a big difference when frac designs and connectivity things make a big difference. And so I think, all of that has been great for us in lowering our cost structure, and I think you're beginning to see that in our bottom line numbers as our finding costs keep going down, our unit costs goes down, our LOEs are going down. And then, you factor in going back onto existing pads to drill wells. Like we talked about at the last call, we've actually, I think, added a couple of wells this year as things get tweaked in our schedule. And some of that's almost round off, but one of those wells can save up to $850,000 because of the infrastructure that's already there. The dirt work, the road, the production facility, the watering elements, all of that stuff already being there can save substantial money. And again, you will see that as we optimize going forward, as we drill longer laterals and as we go back in and fill in the infrastructure, that now has some room and as we keep things full.", "David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "I appreciate that. Do you think that, in aggregate, that's offsetting any of the challenges on the basis side of things? And as you highlighted, or I guess as was highlighted, that you thought that the basis is temporal and this is structural? If you can kind of just walk us through how those cash flows match up over time. That's really what I'm trying to get at.", "Roger S. Manny", "Hey Dave, this is Roger. I can take a shot at that. I think you're right. You're absolutely seeing some offset to the basis challenges on the cost and efficiency side. When you look at our unit cost reduction, it's really across the board and more unit cost reductions to come, and particularly the DD&A rate falling like it has. As I mentioned, $0.41 over 5 years, all the dials on the financial dashboard are showing costs going the right direction. So I do agree that you're seeing an offset effect there of cost versus margin.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And I'll just throw in one point. I mean, I think that what we're seeing in capital efficiencies and well performance and all that, that's a really, really long-term step and it's going to continue to get better. So that's what this is for the long. Some of the market things we hope will go away in 3 or 4 years.", "Ray N. Walker", "The other thing I'll just add in -- and it's all, if you looked on the website, really on Slides 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, that whole section, I think our marketing team has really done an outstanding job. We have a really diverse portfolio that we've talked about. It's really well laid out in those slides, to get us to better price points, to get us to better markets. And it's in conjunction with our plan basically to triple from where we are today, build out that far. So over that timeframe, the unit costs, I think, will continue to get better, the quality wells, capital efficiency will get better. Our portfolio, I think on the marketing side, is better than other people and basins should improve over that time. And we have, since we're a first mover, I think the lowest cost transportation to all those various markets.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Jeff, I wonder if I could just touch on one of the prepared remarks that you made about cash flow in 2016 because I assume, and I guess, it's a capital allocation question really. You've introduced some dry gas economics back into your slide deck, and obviously you started to talk a little bit about free cash flow. So I'm just thinking about, what are you signaling to as in terms of allocation of capital longer-term, particularly if you had a success case in the Utica? How should we think about the capital allocation longer-term? And I've got a follow-up, please.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. Well, I think it's important. We have really strong growth and you guys can invest in a number different companies. But I think when you look at our combination of growth, and then literally, by 2016, not that far out there, we think we can get to 20% to 25% growth within cash flow and then do that beyond. So not only can we triple, but we can triple when we have the financial resources to do it and get growth within cash flow. So it's good organic growth.", "I think we've -- Ray spent time talking about the economics really of all 3 areas, our super-rich, wet and dry. Slide 18 shows you what we have in the southwest, so really strong returns in all 3 areas. And the guys in the northeast have just knocked the ball out of the park with the 16 Bcf wells that cost what -- you're going to be less than $5 million. So even with current differentials, which we expect will improve with time, but even if you take all that into account, we have really strong economics in all areas that gives us confidence to say we can do that.", "Things like the Utica then become additive. So the good news is a great portfolio, diverse markets going to the southwest, LNG exports, southeast, midwest, Canada and all that. Again, next year looking at on the liquids side, I think we have the best liquids portfolio really of anybody out there on the ethane side. So just -- once Mariner East is up next year, it's greater than a 25% uplift then selling it as gas, net of all transportation fees and everything else. The Utica becomes a lot card and it could be a really positive wildcard. Gas in place mounts [ph] are important. Like Ray said, when you look at gas in place in the Marcellus, it's gas in place is important, but it's also the quality of the rock that you can't see. Quality of the rock you can get to by which your EUR per thousand-foot of lateral and that type of thing. So we think we have that in the Marcellus. When you look at the Utica, potentially we have the same thing in the Utica. We believe that because there's wells that already go through it. The whole thing's covered by 3D. We've already seen the well logs. So we have a good degree of confidence, granted until you test it and put it online, you don't know. So all of a sudden, we think those wells can be really competitive. The higher-quality dry gas wells, and the best wells really in the entire Utica play, are marching east right towards us. And because we have wells on our acreage, which we have confidence that we're, hopefully, we'll see some really good results this year that we can talk about.", "And then that can become a wildcard, that can even drive further capital efficiencies, it can drive potentially increased growth or it can drive us on a path to 20%, 25% for a longer period of time. 3 Bs [ph] may become 4, may become 5, which is phenomenal. It's the exciting upside when you think about it.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess what I'm really trying to get at, you guys have always been very, I guess, disciplined about the kind of 20%, 25% growth rate on a sustainable basis. But I guess what I'm trying to get to is, with the expanding resource opportunity perhaps with the Utica but at the heart of that -- and the free cash flow combination, how should we think about your intention to stay within that kind of guidance range, if you like? Or should you, at some point, do we see you accelerate a little bit into your resource opportunity?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, that's a great question. When we modeled it out, not only do we go free cash flow positive, but it starts throwing off a lot of cash. The really important part is we have the portfolio to reinvest that cash, which could give us a higher growth rate and we'll certainly consider that. It's a great position to be in. We're opportunity-rich, so to the extent we can get better growth within free cash flow with returns that are 80%, 100%, 150%. Clearly, that's something that would probably go right to the top of the list.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Wolff with ISI Group.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "A couple for you. One on the DD&A rate, I know you sort of systematically write-off the acreage each quarter, but do you mark-to-market reserves each quarter and how -- is the dynamic of that kind of run on a quarterly basis or more on an annual basis?", "Roger S. Manny", "Jon, it's Roger. We perform a full reserve report every year. And during the year, when there's a material change in the reserve deck through either reserve additions or asset sales, we'll go in and Alan's team will work the numbers, and if there's a significant enough change to the rate, we'll go ahead and make that change. So what you saw at mid-year was the drop in the DD&A rate and, again, we'll probably look at the reserves or we will look at it year-end, and then whatever that reserve assessment dictates, we'll roll that result into the fourth quarter. So as I mentioned, I think you'll see that continue to drift downward as we go forward.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. On the unused firm transport or pipeline takeaway, I understand what you're saying around the cost is basically but within a transport line, and then there's some resale. Where does the resale show up? Is that netted out of the price?", "Roger S. Manny", "On the resale of broker capacity. It's in the brokerage expense line.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So you're paying a cost for some firm that you're not using, correct?", "Roger S. Manny", "That's correct. For the -- yes, the second quarter, total costs for unused capacity that was being brokered was $5.3 million and we recovered $2.8 million of it. So going forward in the third quarter, we anticipate we're going to be able to recover all of that.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So is that just netted out of transport?", "Roger S. Manny", "No. The $2.8 million is in brokered gas revenue and the $5.3 million is -- you'll see embedded in the expense line.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So could you say that the $0.49 base differential, if you are fully -- if you're selling 100% of gas and FTU, it'll actually be lower?", "Chad L. Stephens", "Jon, this is Chad. Could you repeat the question?", "Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So if your base differential was $0.49 but there was some loss on unused transport, if you're fully using your transport, would the $0.49 differential be lower, just theoretically?", "Chad L. Stephens", "Yes, yes.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And that will happen with time. Sometimes you have to take certain deals as they come along because we know we're going to -- maybe that it's a quarter too early, but it's the stuff [indiscernible] fully using.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Totally got that. And then last one is the quarter-over-quarter lateral lengths seems to have jumped quite a bit and -- like when I talked to you last you were 95% on drilling pads and averaging, I don't know, 3 or 4 wells per pad. Can you update on the big jump in lateral lengths as I see it and sort of how we should think about wells per pad going forward, and how that will help capital productivity?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, Jon, this is Ray. As we go into a year with a plan, the team up in the southern Marcellus and the northern Marcellus division together, they've got wells staked out for the next 3 or 4 years. They've actually got pads located and projected lateral lengths for some of those pads. But as you get closer and closer, we -- our goal is always to drill longer if we can because that's one of the most efficient ways to develop the properties. So as we get closer and closer to those dates where we're going to actually start work on a pad, the land team and the geologic team, the operations team, they will all get together and they'll start figuring out, what if we add this lease here or add this lease there and we can drill 500-foot longer laterals and so forth. And so it's what I call normal blocking and tackling of the drilling plan as we go, and we're going to always be tweaking those and I think you'll see them continue to get longer and longer over the next several years. Remember, we have a really huge position there. And so as we're going in and drilling these new pads, our goal is we've gotten better at targeting and completion designs and we're maintaining our EUR per thousand-foot, as long as we can do all that, our goal is to continue and continue to push these laterals longer and longer going forward.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Last one, sorry for all the questions. Land budget is about 14%, so that's around $200 million roughly. You said it would drop to, did you say 4% or 5% in 2017?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Correct, yes.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Can you give us an update on where you are in terms of percentage of lands held that you want to keep? And how the land budget might evolve in '15 and '16?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, I think you can see that on Slide 10. So basically, as Ray mentioned, on Slide 10, you can see in the southwest -- and really we should update this, it's probably a little old, it's 95% of our acreage is HBP or projected to be drilled under existing lease terms, so it means we have total control. It's probably higher since we've put the flight out. And then basically in the northeast, it's like Ray mentioned, it's because of big releases and have continuous drilling, one rig can hold it.", "We're in great shape in terms of where we see the big stacked pay potential in the southwest, the 530,000 acres that we think is more like 1.5 million when you consider the Utica and Upper Devonian. And in the northeast now, we have a great phenomenal success in our dry gas drilling.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ron Mills with Johnson Writes.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "But one thing that -- especially, this probably maybe on Doug's capital allocation question, when you look at the updated economics for northeast Pennsylvania and how that area now seems to compete with your, not just your southwest dry gas but even some of your wet gas wells, how does that fall into your capital allocation process, and then compare and contrast that with what you're still learning about the Mississippi Chat? On a relative return, it seems like even northeast Pennsylvania looks to exceed that. So how did those 2 pieces fit into your puzzle going forward?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, I'd say, one thing when you look at the area, the stuff in the southwest, ultimately, that's the area we ultimately need to drill the hole. And we're, like I said, we're in essence, it's within our existing drilling plans. We're going to hold all that acreage within primary terms. So we want to drill there to finish out holding the acreage. We also want to drill there because of the agreements. And again, we've got some great agreements. Ethane for us next year is a huge uplift. Based on current pricing, it's more than a 25% uplift. Propane netbacks are going to get a lot better starting really early next year with Mariner East.", "But the advantage of the northeast is the way the leases are set up, we have a lot of control in terms of timing. So we've got great economics, but it comes down to where ultimately, we can move the gas, where we think differentials are going to be and how do we maximize that resource.", "But when we think of the mid-continent, we really think of -- when you look at the company, we have 1 million net acres in PA, 475,000 in Southern Appalachian Basin and 360,000 or so in the mid-continent. So we have 3 big footprints in 3 areas. The advantage of the mid-continent is there's liquids to it. And there's really 4 plays, I think, or 5 plays that are pretty interesting. One is the Mississippian Chat, one is the St. Louis, and then you have, we have some great potential in horizontal Granite Wash in Cleveland oil on our existing HBP acreage, and a shot at some Woodford. So even in the chat where we are today, when you look at those original wells that we -- the horizontal wells that we did, we\u2019ve got reserves for 485,000 Boe, they still look like they're on track for that. And the new ones, they look like they're on track for that or better. So really all of them look like they're 485,000 or better. Some of them are 600,000, some of them are 700,000 barrels, the individual wells.", "So in the rates of return, even using 45, we're still 72%. Those are strong returns and low risk, repeatable things. So really, it comes back to portfolio and it allows us that we think to triple from where we are today and maybe beyond with -- maybe even like Doug suggested, accelerated growth in 2016 and beyond.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then secondly, just I guess a subset of the midstream or the marketing side, the asset swap with EQT on the Nora/Haysi, how are you going to be able to utilize that system? Are you going to be able to access places like Cove Point, the Atlantic, southeast Atlantic states, from -- is that just going to be Nora/Haysi gas? Are you going able to get your gas to that system, where there are new projects? Just trying to get a sense as to how -- it seems like there's benefits there, I'm just not fully understanding, I guess, all of the synergies that, that provides.", "Chad L. Stephens", "Yes, Jon, this is Chad. There's a couple of different things it does for us. One, under existing arrangements from transportation that we have, our gas gets dumped in to east Tennessee and east Tennessee connects with the big Transco line that goes up to Station 195, which is at the back door of Cove Point.", "There's lots of announced and under construction natural gas power generation plants in the state of Virginia. Most of those are right there at our backdoor, so we can access the demand that, that creates. And in the future, obviously, EQM has announced the Mountain Valley project comes down through that area pretty close to us for future marketing arrangements into the mid-atlantic and southeast. So there's current good demand in the area, and we see good future potential as well.", "Operator", "Our last question will be from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "So I think this question is maybe for Roger. Just the last [ph] I know there's been a lot of questions asked on realization and -- but, I think you guys mentioned it, it was certainly a bit seasonally weaker-than-normal. But your thoughts as you see going forward, Roger, would you think about putting more different basis hedges there? I mean, not just around obviously gas, but obviously with propane and some of these other markets? I'm wondering, I guess, is there enough volumes -- liquidity on those? Or just, I guess, how you're thinking about perhaps new hedges or incremental hedges going forward, given the realization to the last quarter or two?", "Roger S. Manny", "Yes, I'm going to defer to Chad on the hedging question. But let me back that a little bit on the first part of your question when we're talking about the realizations. I mean, that's profiled in the press release, cash flow was impacted adversely about $19 million in the quarter due to the nonrecurring events at Mariner West and with the weather issue at Houston III. So I think that needs to be mentioned that those were kind of an extraordinary item hit to the second quarter. And again, that $19 million was a significant number when you look at cash flow per share.", "Also, when you look at the costs that are coming down, I mean, the positive ground that we made up on the cost side, it reminds me, I guess it's about 3 years ago during Q&A and John Pinkerton was in the room with us, somebody asked John Pinkerton the question about 3 years ago about prices and margins, much like the question you asked. And John answered the question, he said that he saw in the future where our company's DD&A rate per mcfe and their LOE per mcfe needed to be under $2, and it was a great answer. The problem was the quarter he gave that answer, ours was about $2.12. So it's kind of a tough question and a tough answer, but I think he was dead right. And when you look at our recent quarter, when you add our DD&A rate and the LOE, it's like $1.60. So I think, again, hammering on the difference that the low cost structure makes and the big boost that gives you on your margins, irrespective of your hedge deck and your netbacks.", "So Chad, you want to comment a bit on the hedging side, particularly the bases side?", "Chad L. Stephens", "Yes. So if you -- to start off with, if you look at the NYMEX curve -- the weather, this summer has been 11% cooler than kind of a 10-year norm, so gas burn is way down. So the NYMEX strip has dropped about $0.50. So as NYMEX goes down, the basis in the areas we're selling our gas, if you look at them, it compresses. So we're going to wait. We watch this pretty closely. And if you've noticed over the last quarter or two, we have aggressively hedged our bases as we watch it. So once NYMEX maybe starts moving back up as we move into -- get out of the shoulder season into seasonal demand, winter, as we approach winter, we'll look at those bases and hedge them where we deem necessary.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, Neil, I'd also add, if you look -- you've mentioned liquids, again, if you look on Slide 24 on our deck, I think what, Ray mentioned we're the largest liquids produced in the basin, we have the richest gas. And when you look at, again, the ethane portfolio, I think, it's the best in the industry. It's the second bullet down, better than a hedge, once Mariner East is up, and you look at all 3 things, it's greater than a 25% uplift versus selling the ethane as BTUs and gas. And that fourth bullet down, once Mariner East is up on the propane side -- remember, there's propane and ethane, our netbacks will increase by $0.20 per gallon. So we have some strong things coming up pretty quickly.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Great point, Jeff and as well from Roger. And last, if I could, just one different question on use [ph] obviously. [indiscernible] You've got a lot of acreage potential, besides obviously this upcoming well, your thoughts as far as sort of the best way to tackle that's your type of acreage and then you wait, you certainly have a lot of others that you mentioned during [ph] some other of your acreage around you, so I'm just wondering again how aggressively -- where we maybe see all come out and start drilling there? And I guess how dependent is that on this first well of yours, or is it more dependent on what we'll continue to see from other peers as well as they continue [indiscernible] getting the area?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I think the first well will be really important. We'll have results by the end of the year. We are on track to have that. The beauty of it too is it's stacked pay. So the way our leases are written, any well or any one horizon holds all horizons, so the Marcellus holds it, so to the extent that the well is good, we'll put it online, we'll offset it. And like I mentioned earlier on the call when Doug asked, to the extent we're cash flow positive and we've got prolific wells and we've got excess cash flow to accelerate growth, we'll consider that. So I think we're in great shape.", "Ray N. Walker", "I was going to say, I'll point out too, that from a what do we do next standpoint on the Utica, we've actually got rim on this particular pad to drill several more wells with long laterals. And the Utica, because of all the information we have and the 3D and the old B passed [ph] in the area and all that news, it's not something where we've got to go step out and delineate. We can actually just go in and manufacture that gas when the time comes. So I think you're going to see really great capital efficiencies. And we believe that if, again, we haven't drilled a well yet and we haven't tested it yet, but if it does what we think it does -- will do, it will compete very favorably with the Marcellus, and that's what we're excited about. And it's 400,000 acres, which I think will be the biggest single position than anybody has.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And it's not just 400,000 acres. It's 400,000 acres of what we think is maximum with hydrocarbon in place. We'll find out shortly what we believe could be really high-quality rock.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "So can you just all tie that in right where you're cloning [ph] to get the Marcellus and all the other?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Oh, yes. We'll be able to put that well online.", "Operator", "This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. So our portfolio at range consists of 3 key areas: About 1 million net acres in Pennsylvania, about 475,000 acres in the Southern Appalachian Basin and about 360,000 net acres in the mid-continent. These areas all have the same attributes that we really like at range: Great stacked pay potential, a rich hydrocarbon charge, good infrastructure and great technical, marketing and operating teams focused on creating shareholder value with the assets. It's these assets and this team that gives us the confidence that we can grow at 20% to 25% for many years. As always, we'll stay focused on safely executing our plan and being good stewards of the environment and the communities where we work.", "Thanks for participating on the call. I know there's multiple other people in the queue for questions. Please follow up with the IR team. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]", "Statements contained in this conference call are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions]", "At this time, I would like turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney L. Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome. Range reported results for the third quarter with record production and a continuing decrease in unit costs over the prior year. The order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Chad Stephens, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development.", "Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on our website under the Investor tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we have posted on our website supplemental tables which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and reconciliation of reported earnings to our adjusted non-GAAP earnings that are discussed on the call today.", "Now let me turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you, Rodney. The past several months have been a very challenging time for E&P stocks as Appalachian natural gas prices and now oil prices have been under pressure. We appreciate our shareholders' continued support as the commodity market sort themselves out as they always do. At Range, we remain focused on the things that will make Range and its shareholders successful in the long run, which is executing our plan for low-cost growth day in and day out. As one of the lowest-cost producers with the largest position in the core of the Marcellus, we are excited about what we have in store. Hopefully, in the next hour, you'll have a renewed or newfound appreciation for all the things that are going right at Range and how we've differentiated ourselves.", "This is the 10th year anniversary of the discovery well for the Marcellus, which was Range's rents #1 in October of 2004. This was the first commercial well in the Marcellus and the one that kicked off the play. It was a vertical well. Range followed with the first commercial horizontal well in August of 2007 and announced multiple successful horizontal offsets in December of 2007. Today, anchored by this discovery, we believe that Range has a simple story. One, Range has the largest acreage position in the core of the Marcellus, and being in the core makes a big difference in shale plays. Two, most of that acreage is in Southwest Pennsylvania area, where the Upper Devonian, Marcellus and Utica/Point Pleasant are all stacked on top of each other, which gives us built-in future capital efficiencies. Three, Range has identified the wells to be drilled that will take us to 3 Bcfe per day and beyond. Four, Range has the gathering, compression and processing plants already planned and under contract. Five, Range has the takeaway capacity arranged and under contract to support this growth. Six, Range has the liquidity and balance sheet to deliver on this plan. And seven, importantly, we have the team in place.", "The Marcellus discovery has brought to the region a tremendous supply of natural gas, creating a temporary oversupply in the region and the weakness in pricing that we've all seen. To support this supply growth, billions of dollars are being spent, both domestic and internationally, to utilize these resources for decades to come. With our cost structure and first mover advantages, Range is well suited for this short-term oversupply with outstanding growth plan for the coming years of growing U.S. natural gas demand.", "One of the advantages of being a first mover in a large play is the ability to secure low-cost transportation. We have disclosed our natural gas transportation agreements in the play through 2018. Under these agreements, our transportation grows from 1.1 Bcf per day at a cost of $0.28 this year to 1.75 Bcf per day in 2016 at the same cost for $0.28. In 2018, it grows to 2.4 Bcf per day at a cost of $0.39. It's not just about low transportation costs. It's equally important as to which markets you sell your products in. Our transportation agreements take us to solid demand markets at the endpoints, with the flexibility to sell to additional good markets along the way. By 2018, we plan to be selling into 22 different indices, which -- with gas headed to the Gulf Coast, Southeast, Midwest, Northeast Appalachia and Canada. By 2018, we expect about 1 Bcf per day of Range's production to be moving to the Gulf Coast or Southeast, up from 360 million cubic feet per day today.", "Every company's portfolio of transportation contracts and the destinations and markets that they go to is unique. Based on the data we have seen, Range, capturing the advantage of being the first mover in the play, has the lowest cost and most diversified portfolio to very good markets. Importantly, our transportation capacity follows our expected production growth.", "I also believe the same is true on the liquid side. Range is the largest liquids producer in the basin, and few companies have significant proven liquids-rich acreage. But even these companies that have liquids production, every company is different with unique transportation contracts and unique purchasers associated with them. Being the first mover in the play, coupled with a strong in-house marketing team, Range is in an advantage position here, too. The Mariner East propane project is projected to start up in early 2015. This will result in a significant cost savings of about $0.20 per gallon associated with transporting our propane to the Marcus Hook terminal. It will ultimately result in better propane pricing associated with faster loading in larger ships when exporting the propane. The ethane portion of Mariner East is projected to start up in mid-2015. Once this happens, combining Mariner East, Mariner West and ATEX, we project that we'll receive more than a 25% uplift to our ethane price versus selling the ethane as BTUs in the gas stream, and this is net of all transportation and processing costs. That combined increase of our ethane and propane arrangements when all of our contracts our operational equates to more than $100 million per year uplift to our net cash flow that all begins in 2015. No other company has that ability or the contracts in place for the next 15 years.", "Another advantage to being a first mover is our acreage position. We have the best potential for stacked pay versus any other operator in the basin. This is shown on Slide 10 of our investor presentation on our website. We put together an acreage position of approximately 1 million net acres in Pennsylvania. When considering all of the stacked pay potential, it's more like 1.9 million net acres, which is shown on Slide 11. We are on target for having our first Utica well in Washington County completed and tested in December this year. If successful, it will confirm the Utica/Point Pleasant potential in our Southwest Pennsylvania acreage. Being the first mover and capturing the best stacked pay potential, we've also captured the heart of liquids-rich and super-rich Marcellus. The same is true for the Upper Devonian. Range not only has the most net acreage with the best stacked pay potential, but we also have the best quality of rock in the southwest portion of the Marcellus.", "On Slide 19, when comparing our current completions on a recovery per stage or recovery per lateral foot, the Range wells are the tops in the southwest portion of the play.", "In addition to the positive attributes that I've just mentioned, the southwest portion of Pennsylvania also has the best infrastructure of any area of the play, which allows for expansion into new markets. Having size, scale, quality acreage in an area of good infrastructure and a great team, we have grown our gross Marcellus production in the third quarter to 1.2 Bcfe per day. We are the largest liquids producer in the basin. Our net production for the third quarter consisted of about 700 million cubic feet per day of gas, about 50,000 barrels per day of NGLs and approximately 8,500 barrels per day of condensate. As we've driven up production, our total unit costs have consistently declined. In some cases, we have even reduced our absolute costs as we've hydrated our portfolio and reduced our financing costs. Over time, as we grow net production 20% to 25% each year and drive down unit costs, even if prices remained steady, we expect our annual cash flow to grow by a rate in excess of 20% to 25% per year. As we move more gas to better markets, our gas prices should increase, along with liquids prices through the previously mentioned contracts.", "In addition, as the infrastructure in the basin builds out, our basis should improve with time, too. Importantly, our team has a track record of consistently meeting targets and doing what we say we'll do. Our reserve growth over the last decade has been impressive, and importantly, our performance reserve revisions have been positive for the last 6 years. Those are important aspects of our company.", "We're off to a great start after assuming 100% of operations in Nora, which is our Southern Appalachian division. Ray will discuss some recent technical breakthroughs, which have significantly enhanced that project. It has size, scale, repeatability, very good economics and one of the best gas prices in the United States. We have also made significant progress in the Mississippian Chat play, which will enable us to drill more there in 2015. Ray will talk about that, too.", "The third quarter for Range was a profitable one, in spite of a challenging pricing environment. Assuming stabilizing strip pricing and differentials, we still project that we can be cash flow positive in 2016, and then our planned growth beyond that can be within cash flow. Importantly, we project that we'll continue to grow 20% to 25% in 2016 and beyond, when gas demand is projected to grow significantly from LNG exports, petrochemical, power generation, manufacturing and transportation growth. With visible production growth for many years, price-advantaged end markets, balance sheet strength to exploit our deep inventory of low-cost assets and the capacity to increase our capital efficiency by leveraging our infrastructure as we continue to grow, we believe that we'll be well positioned as natural gas prices stabilize and strengthen over time.", "I will now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.", "Ray N. Walker", "Thanks, Jeff. For the third quarter, we beat our production guidance and either beat or met all of our operating cost metrics. And we continue to see exceptional well results, lower costs and improving capital efficiencies across all our divisions. Production for the third quarter came in at 1.21 Bcf equivalent per day, and we're currently right on track for our fourth quarter guidance of 1.35 Bcf equivalent per day with 30% liquids. This, of course, will put us at the high end of our year-over-year production growth guidance of 20% to 25%.", "For the third quarter, as compared to the same time frame last year, the company achieved 26% production growth. And our unit cost and cash flow improved, as Roger will discuss in his remarks. In the Southern Marcellus Shale division, our well results remain the best in the southwest portion of the Marcellus, and our finding costs are amongst the lowest in the entire play. Let me give you just a couple of examples illustrating recent well performance.", "In our wet and super-rich area, during the third quarter, 4 of the pads, which total 18 wells that we've brought online, had an average 24-hour IP of 16.1 million per day per each well. Again, it's important that I point out that these are actual 24-hour production rates to sales under production facility limited conditions. These 18 wells averaged 4,400-foot laterals and were completed with 25 stages. As I point out, one of those pads was a 5-well super-rich pad where 2 of the wells averaged over 1,000 barrels of condensate per day each, and 2 of the other wells on the pad averaged over 900 barrels of condensate per day each, all for a full 24 hours. In our Southwest PA dry area, we brought online a 3-well pad that had an average 24-hour IP to sales of 26.4 million a day. The 30-day average to sales for the 3 wells was 17.4 million a day per well, and they averaged 5364-foot laterals with 28 stages. These 2 examples illustrate both the quality of our core acreage in Southwest Pennsylvania, along with the technical and operational expertise of our team. On both an absolute and on a normalized basis, our results were consistently the best in the region.", "Operating efficiencies are also strong. For 2014, we will drill approximately 12% of our wells on existing pads. And just to remind you, all of our drilling has been pad drilling for many years, and as I've discussed on previous calls, this gives us the ability to go back and drill up to 20 more wells per pad in any horizon as capacity frees up in the gathering system, while at the same time, appreciating huge capital savings and improved well performance, as we've discussed before. This really allows us to optimize our investment in gathering and will provide us the lowest cost over time.", "As an apples-to-apples comparison to some recently reported metrics in the region, year-to-date, as compared to the same time frame last year in Southwest Pennsylvania, we've seen a 17% decrease in unit cost per Mcfe on a lateral foot basis, which is a clear indication of improving capital efficiency. And again, we believe the best in the basin, and we continue to execute more and more efficiently. Year-to-date, we've pumped 15% more frac jobs as compared to 2013, and we expect to pump approximately 42% more stages in 2014 as compared to '13. As you might suspect, this translates to a pretty good production and revenue increase as we bring wells on in a better pricing environment this winter.", "For 2014, our average lateral link for wells in Southwest PA, including super-rich wet and dry, is projected to be 5,402 feet. This is 55% longer than in '13. For 2015, we're estimating that our average lateral length in Southwest PA will be more than 6,200 feet, with 1/3 of the wells over 7,000 feet, and our longest lateral will be almost 12,000 feet. We expect longer laterals to continue to lead to higher EURs and even better returns. And on the volume side, our production from the Southern Marcellus Shale division for the third quarter is almost 36% higher this quarter as compared to last year. And we just set pipe on our Utica test in Washington County, PA, and are currently beginning our planned 32-stage completion. The logs and other diagnostic information from the well are consistent with our expectations. And the current schedule has us starting the completion this -- or as I just said, just now, followed by a flow test in December.", "Shifting to Northeast Pennsylvania. Production for the third quarter was 25% higher than last year, driven mostly by outstanding well results. We're still maintaining our activity level at 1 to 2 rigs, while the team is doing really well at lowering costs and developing bigger and bigger wells. At the last call, we announced the well in Lycoming County that flowed under constrained conditions at 25.1 million a day for 30 days, with a 6,550-foot lateral. The state data reports that well at 22.2 million a day for 53 days. To follow up, that well has now averaged 20.1 million a day for 90 days and is one of the top 10 wells in Pennsylvania, and I might add, the only well in the top 10 not operated by Cabot and not in Susquehanna County. We're planning in early 2015 to drill a full-well pad, offsetting this record well, with average lateral lengths of over 8,000 feet. For 2014, our lateral lengths in Northeast PA are 34% longer than last year, and the team is consistently bringing these wells in at less than $5 million. For 2015, we expect our lateral lengths will be approaching 6,000 feet, and we expect them to continue to get longer with larger EURs and improving economics.", "For the Midcontinent division, the team is making progress in refining the geologic model for the Chat play. Please refer to the earnings release for the details on recent wells. So far this year, our 2014 wells have shown a 33% improvement in their 30-day IPs over our 2013 wells. And with 37% of our wells, during the second and third quarters, having max 24-hour IPs greater than 1,000 Boe per day, we're confident that we've identified key reservoir areas to target going forward. For 2 quarters now, we've set records in well performance. And with continued success in the fourth quarter, we expect to be able to modestly increase the activity level in the Chat play next year. We're still finalizing those plans and will announce the planned well counts when we announce the 2015 budget.", "Moving to the Southern Appalachian division. We introduced our plans for the next 18 months at the last call, and I'm happy to report that operations are progressing with very encouraging results. Again, we have a lot of details in the earnings release. With Range now having a full quarter of operational control over the Nora assets in Virginia, the team has introduced new techniques and well designs, resulting in an improved performance and economics. In the short period of time, Range has already achieved some of the best CBM results in 15 years using a major well design change, incorporating higher-grade casing and higher-rate foam fracs. The additional costs are around $10,000 to $20,000 per well. With 6 CBM wells turned to sales using the new completion technique, average results are 100% better than the historical field average, with returns of 100% or better. On a particular note is a new CBM well that's produced at a 60-day average of 340 Mcf a day, which is 5x the average CBM rate. And we just turned in line a new completion that's at that same level. There's over 2,000 CBM locations identified at the current spacing with the potential of over 3,000 infill locations. Similar improvements have been achieved with the same well design and high-rate fracture technique on the vertical tight gas wells, with overall results more than 70% better than historical field average for approximately $10,000 to $15,000 in additional costs. With 7 tight gas wells turned to sales with these new designs, the 30-day production average of these wells is the highest in over 10 years. The estimated rate of return of these wells is over 74%, and there are over 1,500 locations that are de-risked for future tight gas development. The division is also drilling horizontal Huron Shale wells, and there are over 2,000 de-risked horizontal Huron Shale locations currently identified.", "And lastly, I want to remind you of the exploration potential beneath the 475,000 net acres that Range now controls in the Southern Appalachian basin. With only 4 penetrations below the Devonian Shale, we believe there's significant potential for exploration in the 6,000-plus feet of additional sediment between the Devonian Shale and the basement. Remember the old saying, the best place to look for oil and gas is in an oil and gas field.", "I want to reiterate a couple of important points about Southern Appalachian. Number one, we own the minerals, thereby, yielding better economics since we have 100% of the working interest and 100% of the net revenue interest for most of the property. And number two, like Jeff mentioned earlier, our Nora production sells into one of the best markets for natural gas on the East Coast. We expect the average NYMEX plus $0.20 year round, with some gas potentially achieving even better prices than the prime winter markets. The well-defined, large and de-risked inventory of projects, which totals over 5.2 TCF of de-risked resource potential in Virginia, coupled with the new well designs, improving well performance, large gathering system with capacity, expanding demand in the region and favorable pricing, gives us confidence that we have the potential to ramp up production in the coming years with economics that are very strong even relative to the Marcellus.", "In closing, we have an experienced and innovative team, a great portfolio of projects, a proven track record of execution, innovative marketing solutions with takeaway capacity, and all the infrastructure and financing security to achieve our growth projections for many years. There's really one clear message that I want to get across today. We have everything in place, soup to nuts, with the track record to support, to achieve our goals for growth in production and cash flow within a low-cost structure, building shareholder value for many years.", "Now over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny", "Thanks, Ray. The third quarter brought steady improvement in our cost structure and balance sheet, with continued year-over-year growth and cash flow despite lower realized prices.", "Starting with the balance sheet this time. Since our last quarterly call, Range has received an upgrade from S&P to BB+ and Moody's with our Ba1 credit outlook from neutral to positive. These upward moves by both rating agencies ratify our continued progress, both operationally and financially. As natural gas and natural gas liquids continue to become true global commodities in the years ahead, our improved credit standing and favorable export contracts will help us continue to compete for long-term customers and new and better priced markets, not just in the U.S. but all over the world.", "Following the ratings upgrade. Even though Range has continued to add significant, long-term, firm transportation commitments and now has sufficient contracted capacity to see us through many years of double-digit production growth, the amount of standby letter of credit collateral posted behind these commitments has declined by 21% from its peak earlier this year. Posting collateral behind pipeline contracts or taking an equity interest in a pipeline to avoid posting collateral adds the hidden cost of transportation and reduces available liquidity.", "Credit quality matters now, and we believe it'll matter even more later. Complementing our new credit ratings, Range restructured and renewed for another 5 years our bank credit facility. The facility size was increased to $4 billion. The borrowing base was increased to $3 billion, and we chose an additional commitment of $2 billion. Importantly, borrowings under the new credit facility are priced 1.25% below the old facility, and the new credit contains a fallaway collateral feature that will enhance our future transition to investment grade. Like the old credit facility, the new facility is comprised of a leading energy industry's savvy group of diversified domestic and international financial institutions, with no one bank holding more than 6% of the commitment. I wish to thank each of these 29 institutions for their continued support of Range, equipping us with a state-of-the-market credit facility.", "Now moving to the income statement. Cash flow for the third quarter was $257 million, 5% higher than last year's third quarter. EBITDAX for the third quarter was $294 million, 2% higher than last year. Cash flow per fully diluted share was also higher than last year at $1.54 per share. Given that the third quarter of net realized Mcfe prices were down 17% from last year's third quarter, these year-over-year increases in cash flow and cash flow per share were the hard-fought result of disciplined growth at low cost. Reported net income for the third quarter of $146 million was almost 8x higher than last year due to a pretax $125 million mark-to-market derivative gain, as our hedges became more valuable with declining prices. Third quarter earnings, calculated using the methodology used by most analysts, which exclude asset sales, mark-to-market hedging entries and various nonrecurring items, was $62 million, 8% higher than last year at $0.37 fully diluted share. As Rodney mentioned earlier, please reference the various reconciliation tables found on the Range website and earnings release for full reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP.", "Looking at our cost performance in the third quarter. Total unit costs were down by $0.36. In the case of interest expense, on an Mcfe basis, this expense was not only down year-over-year by 30% or $0.15 per Mcfe, it was also down by approximately $5 million on an absolute basis as well. Another noteworthy third quarter unit cost expense decline was in our DD&A rate, coming in at $1.28 an Mcfe, down 14% from $1.48 figure for Mcfe last year. The decline in DD&A rate continues to signal improved capital efficiency, which helps our cash flow grow faster with less capital. Please reference the third quarter earnings release for additional detailed expense item guidance for the fourth quarter.", "The earnings release also contains summary details of our hedge positions on both commodities and basis in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Additionally, detailed hedge volume and price information may be found on our website.", "In summary, the third quarter was a solid quarter, with the benefits of low-cost growth outweighing the negatives of significantly lower realized NGL gas and oil prices. Building off of the balance sheet improvements and restructured credit facility, based on current strip prices, we are positioned to finish strong in 2014, with a return to double-digit, quarterly, year-over-year cash flow growth to a company of double-digit production growth.", "Chad, over to you.", "Chad L. Stephens", "Thanks, Roger. First, I'd like to provide a little macro perspective on Appalachian natural gas. Northeast natural gas supply has grown to a current rate of roughly 60.5 Bcf per day. Half of that coming from Southwest Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, and the other half from Northeast Pennsylvania. Most of the recent volume growth has come from the Southwest Pennsylvania region, with Northeast PA supply flattening due to pipeline constraints in that area. Base demand in the overall northeast is approximately 12 to 13 Bcf per day, including summer injection. This seasonal oversupply has had a negative impact on regional Appalachian index prices during the current shoulder period. Index prices in other parts of the country have remained relatively stable. As the current shoulder period ends and winter season demand picks up, northeast regional index prices are expected to improve. The good news is the Midstream industry is bringing relief to the oversupplied Appalachian region. Beginning in mid-2015 through 2018, new announced pipeline takeaway capacity from Appalachia totaling an estimated 31 -- excuse me, 34 Bcf per day and representing over $35 billion of capital investment will provide improved supply/demand equilibrium, strengthening Appalachian basis differentials and improving net realized prices. Also, beginning in 2015 and growing through 2020, increasing demand, totaling an estimated 15 to 20 Bcf per day, is expected to come from DOE FERC-approved LNG exports, the majority of which is on the Gulf Coast, increasing exports to Mexico, power generation, especially in the Southeast and pet chem industry growth. As we have emphasized in our third quarter earnings release and in our IR presentations, Range's early entry into the Marcellus has allowed us to secure relatively low-cost, firm transportation, the in-service date of which follow our projected annual production growth of 20% to 25%. We want to assure we are not paying for capacity we won't be using. These firm transportation arrangements move our natural gas and natural gas liquids to markets, with strong year-round demand and stable index prices. As mentioned earlier, we're sending our gas to the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast. We believe that there are certain locations on the East Coast as well that have strong demand throughout the year, including the summer, and provide attractive index prices. We will continue to pursue those markets as well.", "I will direct you to our earnings release, which provides detail on our corporate gas price basis differential to NYMEX for the third quarter of minus $0.49, which is an improvement over the second quarter. As you know, Range extracts ethane from our wet gas at the MarkWest processing plants. We do this because our ethane sales contracts generate more cash flow for Range then leaving the ethane in the gas stream. For Range, we prefer to optimize cash flow rather than a higher gas price and NGL price per unit.", "Alternatively, some of our peers leave their ethane in the gas stream, creating richer gas, and reflect the impact of a richer gas as BTU uplift in their gas price realizations. Again, Range maximizes our cash flow by extracting the ethane from the gas and selling it separately into, by mid-2015, 3 different sales agreements. If you took our current ethane sales proceeds and added it to our total corporate gas production revenue, it would increase our corporate gas price realization by $0.32 for the third quarter. As a result of this, the third quarter corporate differential would be minus $0.17 rather than the minus $0.49 figure reported. We believe this to be the most accurate comparison of peer group gas price realizations.", "While in the near term, the Northeast regional oversupply subsides as Midstream industry builds out their announced expansion projects, Range will continue to direct our efforts toward finding the strongest, most stable areas of domestic natural gas demand. We also are expanding our NGL sales efforts to a broader, more global scope, seeking any available arbitrage in international markets.", "Back to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "You've talked about the increase in your takeaway contracts in detail in your slides over the past couple of months in 2016 versus 2014, but can you talk a bit about 2015 and how those contracts look if we would take away the benefit of Mariner East out of the equation and assume no changes to recent pricing? What you see as the benefits to your margins from the contracts that would be coming on in the next year?", "Chad L. Stephens", "Yes, Brian, this is Chad. As we've alluded to in the notes, there are other areas of the country where the indexes have remained relatively stable. One of those is in the Midwest. We do have, in 2015, some significant volume coming on to take gas through the Chicago, Michcon area, which is -- that's really the main amount that's coming on in 2015. Again, 2016, we have quite a bit coming on that's going to the Gulf Coast. It's really competitive, and we do have some other deals we're working on with NiSource and TETCO that we really don't want to get into specifically. So I can just say that, that level [ph] in lateral Michcon, Chicago volume that's coming on in 2015 is what we want to talk about.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, and I would just add to it. What Chad had mentioned earlier, we're going to get into winter pricing, assuming we have any kind of normal winter, which some of the weather forecasters are saying we will. So we'll get into winter pricing, which is good in Appalachia and with our contracts. And we get into Mariner East propane in the first quarter of next year of 2015. We get into Mariner East ethane at the middle of the year, and all these things are uplifts. And now we get into the better gas price contracts that Chad mentioned, coupled with just the increased demand with the LNG exports, Cheniere starting up, hopefully, and projected to be on time about this time next year. Plus some of the increased Mexican exports and also -- we think that Range is uniquely positioned with ethane contracts and propane contracts and some things that some of our competitors don't have that will give us an uplift in a stable price environment or steady price environment. But we have some incremental contracts and things coming on as well.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And as a follow-up, switching to the Utica. Your Utica heat map [ph] now focuses more heavily on Southwest PA. If your thesis is correct, how would that change how you think about your capital priorities between Utica -- between drilling the Utica versus the Marcellus within Southwest PA? And how strategic would that change, how strategic your Northeast PA position as to the company?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, let me talk a little bit about -- one of the things we do that you just mentioned is our map before for gas in place or hydrocarbon in place was for Utica/Point Pleasant. So we stripped it out and showed just the Point Pleasant since that's the real reservoir target, and that's where the more prolific wells are. And we think it's not just about gas in place, but we think there's other things that factor into it. Another key factor other than gas in place is we think the areas of the highest pore pressure and highest geo pressure really relate to where the high-quality gas wells are. And we've outlined that in green on Slide 14. So when you look at where those 2 things coincide, we have a really dominant position in there, of course, where -- there's old Trenton-Black River wells that gives us the ability to map that, and then we've just drilled, and pet logged, and cased our first well, and we're in the process of completing it. Importantly, when you look at our hydrocarbon in place numbers, there's no potential in there right now for Utica/Point Pleasant. When you look at the acreage map back on Slide 11, in that Southwest -- we have south -- 537,000 acres in Southwest PA on Slide 11. 400,000 of those acres are prospective for Utica/Point Pleasant. So you can kind of do the math yourself, take the gas in place numbers, times that, and come up with what the resource potential could be. Specifically getting into your question, our strategy is to have that well completed, tested, and if all goes well, announced towards the end of December. We'll put that well online and test it, and we have the capacity and ability to do that. And then we'll offset that well a couple of times with the wells spudding somewhere in the spring of next year, and we'll drill a couple of more wells. And then we'll watch their performance. Then the key is, really, the performance of those wells. Again, strategically, when you go into 2016, even with where prices are, where the strip is today, we still think that we'll be cash flow neutral to a little bit positive in '16, but we think in 2017, '18 and beyond, we throw off a lot of cash. So the Utica gives us optionality. One of the options with increased cash flow is to reinvest in the high rate of return projects and pull some of that value forward and potentially ramp growth in those years. Still living within cash flow but getting higher growth because of the incremental cash flow that we'll have. Another option that it gives us is to the extent the returns are strong, we can start rolling in Utica wells and get even more efficient capital growth. We think there's a lot of efficiencies coming. Another important part, I think, to our acreage position, stepping back away from your question a little bit, is the fact that we own all horizons. So we drill -- as we're drilling the Marcellus and driving up production and driving up cash flow, we're holding everything above and below. So there's no pressure on us to drill. It's a great option that I think will create a lot of value on our stock. Kind of a long-winded answer, but I wanted to -- hopefully, I answered your question and added a little bit to it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Doug, are you on? You may be muted, we can't hear you. Operator, we're not hearing anything on our end from Doug.", "Operator", "Okay, I'll go on to the next -- next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Say, Jeff, for you or Ray, the first question is, obviously, just -- I was looking at, I guess, the expected wells that come online in the fourth quarter. Certainly, a large number of the wet area in the Marcellus and then, obviously, in the Nora. So I guess, as you look out into 2015, is this an indication of getting kind of the -- indication of, I guess, the direction you're going to go there? Or how do we think about 2015 CapEx directionally?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Let me talk at a high level, and then, Ray, you may want to add to it. What we typically do every year is we -- of course, we have a long-range plan. We've revised that periodically. We present it to our board in December. Upon board approval -- and typically, what we've done is announce it towards the end of January. So our capital budget is not set yet. That being said, I think what you'll see -- and we've talked about it a lot through a number of things like longer laterals and more stages and better targeting and LOE coming down and unit costs coming down, ultimately, land costs coming down, you're going to see the capital efficiency roll through. Roger mentioned, we're already seeing it in the DD&A coming down strongly over time. So we haven't set that yet. Clearly, our budget next year will continue. The value driver will be the Marcellus. And -- but you may see a little bit of incremental capital go towards Nora and/or a little bit in the Midcontinent. But you're still going to see 90-plus strong percentage of our capital being directed towards the Marcellus with the longer lateral wells. Ray, do you want to comment about some of the wells lateral lines in the fourth quarter and a little bit maybe what you're thinking about for the '15?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, sure. Neal, what -- I think we're -- there is no question, we're striving to drill longer and longer laterals. We see that as really improving our capital efficiency. Our team is learning a lot of technical things about targeting and RCF completions and frac designs. We're making a lot of really great progress from what we think is already a leading position as far as well performance because we do have that core area. I think another thing to point out is the mix of wells, I think, will change from time to time just simply because we have -- remember, we have 1 million net acres. We're developing over 500,000 of that in Southwest PA. We have dry, we have wet, and we have super-rich. When you look at our presentation that the economics of those 3 different areas, you'll see they're all relatively close, something over 100% even at today's -- all of today's prices, today's EBITDAX, transportation costs, everything rolled in as it is. They're all very competitive. So HBP is not really an issue anymore. We've got that taken care of. And what we see going forward is just really a focus on driving up our capital efficiency even to higher levels than we are today. And I think you'll just see that kind of ebb and flow between super-rich, wet and dry as we go and as we build out infrastructure and make all that happen.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Ray, just a follow-up to that. How do the -- sort of the near term differentials play into your thoughts about what to drill? I mean, I was just looking, obviously, where your guidance -- we certainly know that just in the near term, the Northeast PA has a little bit wider differentials until some of your FT and other things come online. How do the differentials sort of play into this in the near term until some of the FT and other arrangements come online?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, we look at everything on a real-time basis. So we make real-time capital allocations throughout the year. And when you look at the economics in Northeast PA today, again, with all the basis differentials, with all -- everything that the Northeast PA market is challenged with right now, because our team is doing so well with those wells, our well costs are down below $5 million, and we're making wells that are -- have 90-day production of over 20 million a day. Well, some of the top 10 wells in the Northeast PA, those wells still, on a rate of return basis, compete very favorably, even with the wells in Southwest PA. And of course, in Northeast PA, we have -- everything is HBP-ed up there. We can maintain that area with the 1- to 2-rig program, but that's, again, like Jeff was talking about earlier, as we move into the out years, past 2016, when we go cash flow neutral or slightly positive, we're going to start throwing off lots of cash in the outer years. We see Northeast PA as another area that we can ramp up because we do believe, as Chad was speaking about earlier, the increased takeaway projects, the increased demand, that's -- there's billions of dollars being spent on, we believe all of this is going to allow us a great option to able to accelerate areas going forward. And one of those areas could potentially be Northeast PA.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And Jeff, one last one, if I could. You all mentioned just a large amount of mineral ownership that you all have. Would you think down the line, either '15 or '16, of some sort of monetization around this like one of your peers has done at Perm or? Have you all got any thought to that?", "Roger S. Manny", "Yes. Neal, this is Roger. I'll take a swing at that one. When you look back 8 years, Range has sold or exchanged over $3 billion worth of assets. So I think we've got a pretty clear history of when we have an asset that we feel is worth more to a different set of shareholders than ours, than we will part with that asset. And I don't -- we don't view this any different view. I think, though, in the case of the Nora royalty, when you look at the low decline underlying that field, I mean, this is an enormously high-quality royalty interest. And I think even as faulty is the valuation might look out there today, I think it's better than most of what's out there. So -- but looking back at our history, we're very reluctant to part with an asset until we know with a high degree of certainty what it's really worth. So for us, the issue isn't so much the front [ph] evaluations that might be out there today. But as Ray was mentioning, the extraordinary improvements that we're seeing in recovery, in production out there, what does that asset going to be worth a year or 2 out. We want to get our arms around that before we make those kind of decisions. I think that's very characteristic of how we've done things in the past and what you'll see us do going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Two quick questions, if I may. First of all, on the Nora. I don't know if you touched on -- or at least not to the extent that we wanted to on the deeper opportunity in the Nora. Is this a dry gas play in the deeper -- down the basement that you talked about? Or is there a liquids opportunity? I'm just -- and I'm thinking really more about the premium gas market. How does this impact your capital allocation decisions, particularly as it relates to Northern Marcellus? And I've got a follow-up, please.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, let me take that one. Yes, Nora is really interesting, and Ray mentioned we're doing some fairly low-tech things that are really inexpensive to enhance value of the tight gas sands in CBMs and having great success right out of the box. I think we're 10 for 10 or 12 for 12. But it's interesting, there's potential, deeper potential. Some of that deeper potential is in the Devonian section, literally. I mean, by deep, I mean, we're talking 5,500 feet. But there are other horizons as you go below that. According to our exploration, and we'll see over time, some of the upside or optionality is, even though the southern part of the Appalachian basin is subnormally pressured, our explorationists think as you drill deeper, and remember, deeper may be, ultimately, basement. We're not sure where basement is, which is really exciting. It may be 11,000 12,000, 13,000 feet because nobody's ever drilled that deep. There's only -- the deepest -- most of the well stop at 4,000. Some at the 5,500. There's a couple of wells, one goes to 7,000 and one goes to 7,500. But they're old wells, old technology. No 3D seismic and just a couple of old 2D [ph] lines. Our explorationists feel as you go deeper, you actually break back in to normal pressure, and then potentially, geopressure, which is exciting. And they also think some of those horizons, as you go deeper, may contain liquids or wet gas. Well, we'll see with time. The nice part about it is we have 475,000 acres that are basically unexplored deep. Again, deep, being below 5,500 feet, which isn't really that deep in most parts of the U.S. So we have that potential. We own 475,000 acres, 100% working interest and most of 100% net revenue interest. And we totally control the timing. So what you'll see us do in the short run is experiment with some of these completion techniques, which really is just running a higher strength pipe so we can pump at a higher pressure, pump at higher rates, pump bigger fracs and better stimulate the wells. And there, it's fairly inexpensive, and we're seeing, on average, almost double the rates for an incremental cost of, call it, $15,000. So long-winded answer again, but I think there is the potential for higher pressure as we go deeper and there is the potential for liquids.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So Jeff, just -- again, this is obviously arguably a better gas market than your Northern Marcellus. So I guess you're just running minimum activity there any way to hold acreage. But how does it stack up in terms of the overall portfolio, as almost like a diversification play if you like, now that you own the whole thing?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, and we have in the book and there's some slides in there, and Ray talked about it last time. We're just flipping through the slides. On Slide 19, you can see the returns in the -- under various gas prices in the southwest part of the Marcellus, depending on price you use and where you are. Anywhere between about 90% to 120% rate of return. You've got strong returns in the Northern Marcellus there in that -- really in that same range. And then when you flip to the Appalachian slides that we have in there, on Slides, really, 31 -- Slides 30 and 31, we're saying the returns of some of those projects are also up to 100%. So they're all strong returns. The one area that you'll see us focus on drilling again in the short run is the Southwest Marcellus in that that's the only area where, ultimately, we need to drill to hold all the production. To make it really clear, with the leases we have and the drilling plans we have, we'll hold all that acreage within the existing lease terms that we have. So there's no concern over losing it. But we need to drill it to hold it. So you'll see us focus our activity down there. It also happens to be where we have some of the highest returns, and it also happens to be where we have the flexibility of wet, dry and super-rich, plus we have all the stacked pay potential and information that we gather as we drill those wells. But in time, I think there's a great upside in the Nora. When you look at that area, we're making roughly 100 million per day. I think with what we've identified, I think we have the potential to drive it to greater than 500 million per day, with stuff that's already on the books, 500 million could become 700 million. You throw a little bit upside in, and I think there's great potential if we have some exploration success and stuff down in that part of the basin. And it's near good gas markets.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I don't want to labor the point, but can you put a time line on that? Because, actually, what I'm trying to get at is how quickly do you think you...", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. I think, what I mean, -- we have it again. We'll present our budget to the board in December because of the fact that we didn't have a JOA with EQT down under. And most areas, you do have a JOA. We couldn't spend capital. So really, capital allocation in Nora has been close to 0. And with last year, I think we had allocated -- or this year $20 million roughly. So we haven't set our budget yet. I think for next year, $20 million may become $50 million, something like that, $40 million, $50 million, $60 million. We haven't set it yet. The year after that, it may become something like $100 million, again, all subject to board approval. And then $100 million may become $200 million. And you'll see that ramp kind of in that time frame. And as we do that, we'll unlock what we believe is great value or out-of-the-box, I think, we're off to a strong start in enhancing the value. And then we can decide that ultimate ramp and how to ultimately maximize the value even from a financial perspective.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Jeff, I don't want to take out too much time here, but I've got a very quick follow-up, if I may. Just real quick. You've been very good about optimizing capital. When I look at the stock that you mentioned there, I just kind of wonder, when you start talking about Utica, Devonian and Marcellus, all in the same kind of area, what can you do to reduce your surface footprint? I'm thinking about is there a multi-stock gradual opportunity somewhere down the line? Or is it still too early to think about that?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, I think one advantage, as Ray pointed out, is we can put a lot of wells on those pads in excess of 20 wells on the pad and to whatever horizon we want. So then you get the ability utilizing the same pads and roads and a lot of the other infrastructure. So there -- but I think you're right with time, having stacked pay like that, there's kind of a free auction of technology in the future of stacked laterals. And clearly, you can drill stacked laterals right now. And then, I'm sure, with time, ultimately, we may be able to drill stacked laterals and effectively stimulate them. So there's a nice upside to what technology can bring. And there's a big advantage to having all those horizons on top of one another, let alone scattered out across different parts of the country.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Allman with JPMorgan.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Regarding the new completion techniques and the completion designs, I heard what you said on Nora. I also heard what you said on longer laterals and better targeting. But what design changes do you think are having the most impact? And what are some of the new techniques that you're trying? And can you talk about the differentiation by area?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Ray, do you want to take that one?", "Ray N. Walker", "Sure. I'll start with Nora. And like Jeff alluded to, really, what it amounted to there is, in the past, a lot of those wells were -- completed limited entry where you put a limited amount of perforations in a lot of different layers and try to accomplish the stimulation with one frac job. Essentially, what we're doing today, by running, investing a little more money in constructing the well with higher strength casing, we can pump at higher rates and higher pressures and allow us to pump more fluid at higher fracture pressures down hole, so to speak. You create more near wellbore complexity and fractures, which, therefore, yields more production. And that's been highly successful at this point. Again, we're early, but like Jeff said, I think we're 10 for 10 or 12 for 12. And some of the best results we've seen in 10 or 15 years, both in the tight gas vertical and the CBM. I think there's a huge potential for us to study and model that further and look at different types of frac designs, different volumes and a lot of things there. Like Jeff said for a number of years, we've not really spent much money there, and we just have really done a lot other than just maintenance type work. So we're pretty excited about that. Shifting to the Marcellus, we're doing a lot of the things. We're just continuing to refine and do a lot of the things that we've been doing all along. And you've seen us, year after year, continue to update our EURs. Our type curves continue to look better. Our results on a normalized per foot of lateral basis have been very consistent. And we think there's still a lot of work to do as we continue to refine our targeting techniques, we continue to define the spacing between our RCS completions and perforation clusters and different types of profit designs or some of things that we're working on, the profit loading, liquid loading that we're pumping into these wells. So a lot of that stuff is continuing on with what we've been doing in the past, and you've seen us just continue to get better and better results. I'm really proud of our technical team there, and my hats off to them continually because they just continue to make better and better wells, I mean, some of the wells I've talked about in my remarks. When you've got 4 out of 5 wells making close to 1,000 barrels of condensate per day, I mean, that's a tremendous fracture conductivity down hole. And we're really excited about what that means going forward. And we've seen just in the last couple of quarters some of the best wells we've ever done. And we're pretty excited about that and how we use that information going forward. So again, we're just continuing to capture that data, model it, understand it and continue to refine that going forward. And I think we -- like we talked about a lot of times in the past, I still think we're in the third or maybe fourth inning of the baseball game. We've got large core area there with a lot of diversity being super-rich, wet and dry. And I think there's no one pat answer for any one specific area. And I think as our team has learned to identify those things, which makes the best wells, I think we're just going to -- you're going to continue to see our capital efficiency get better and better.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "The only thing I'd add to what Ray said is we're in that maybe third inning of the Marcellus or so. And the Point Pleasant in Washington County, we have first batter up. So we're excited about the first batter.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And Ray, do you think we're in the third or fourth inning in terms of the technological leaps? Or do you think we're in the third or fourth inning in terms of the application across your acreage?", "Ray N. Walker", "I think it's -- mostly both is the way I would characterize it. I think there's some technological breakthroughs that are being looked at in a lot of different areas, whether it's modeling, whether it's frac design or just pure operations. Even in the well construction side of things, like Jeff referred to, being able to drill stacked laterals or even opposing laterals out of a single vertical wellbore, I think there's some major technological breakthroughs that will happen in the next, I think 3 years or 7 years out, but some of it exists and some of it is just not commercially applicable in our situation yet. But I think those things will happen. And when they do, it'll be a major step change. And none of that is built into our long-range plan, and I think that those kind of things are just going to be more upside for us going forward.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "But I would -- I agree with Ray, but what I would add, though is, again, what's really important is to be in the core part of the play, whether it's in Marcellus or any play. So you want to be in the core and about -- on average, about 10% of the acreage is core. And then it's important when you compare cores of the various plays. And the advantage that the Marcellus had is its higher-quality rock versus some of the other plays in other parts of the country. The big technology increases will really impact people in those areas. What you want to have is acreage in the core with high-quality rock, a lot of hydrocarbon in place. And then using high-quality teams, tighter spacing, new technology and better completion and drilling techniques to just keep driving up recovery factors. And I think we're in that position.", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And then are you convinced that you're getting increased EURs versus just bringing production forward?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes.", "Alan W. Farquharson", "Yes.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And the third yes was Alan Farquharson, our Senior Reservoir Engineer. If you heard 3 yeses on the call, so...", "Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I did. And I could say I got that confirmation. And then just quickly, in your Northeast PA, could you just remind us of your takeaway situation there? And is that also -- are you in good shape there, keeping up with production growth? And also talk about any asset, the after-sale right now or in the near future.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, let me just say it at a high level, and then I think we'll probably take one more question. And then we're already running over a little bit. I don't want to run over it too long. The marketing team's done a really good job. We have a long-range plan, which is important part. We have really well-integrated team, everybody from all the engineering, geology, marketing, finance, midstream, all the different pieces. So the plans that we have, long range for that acreage, the marketing team's done a good job of varying the takeaway to good markets for that team as well. So I think in terms of takeaway out of there, I think we're in pretty good shape.", "Operator", "Nearing the end of today's conference, we will go to Dan McSpirit of BMO Capital Markets.", "Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I have several questions, but will limit it to one and one that's maybe more philosophic. If you speak to an improving supply/demand balance in today's press release or yesterday's press release, what are the chief risks to that outlook, whether on the supply or demand side of the equation? I asked to not only get your view of the world but determine whether producers in the basin that are less well positioned have really felt maximum pain?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, let me start at the high level and then turn it over to Chad, and then there may be others on our team that want to talk about it. But I think the good news when you look on the demand side is -- there's a number of analysts out there, and I won't quote them, but there's a lot of people that show incremental gas demand, plus or minus 20 Bcf per day. Some people are saying 2018, 2019, 2020. I think on the high side, the University of Texas had 25 Bcf of incremental demand. And it comes from a number of things. So I think on the LNG side, again, Cheniere, the first project, everything that I hear is on time. And the second and third trains, they'll start in '16. All of that is on time, and it should happen. So I think the LNG stuff in the U.S. is important. I think gas is a superior fuel to coal. So in terms of -- gas has been displacing coal from power generation with time. I think that'll continue as well. Billions are being spent on the petrochemical side to convert the feedstock from an oil-based feedstock to a gas-based feedstock. So I think that'll happen. And slowly but surely, you're seeing transportation occur. So I think the demand is coming, the demand is coming timely, plus there's exports to Mexico. So I think those things will happen. On the supply side, again, I think most of the plays -- the core parts of the plays are about 10%. Our teams have looked at all the plays around the country. They range from a low of 6% being core to a high of 17%, according to our team, with an average of 10%, which means 90% is non-core. If you look at a lot of the non-core stuff, it's not going to get drilled in the next 20 years or 30 years. I don't think. I think it's way out there. So I think, ultimately, as that shakes out, there's help there. And then the other piece is the infrastructure build-out, and we have a slide in there in our presentation that addresses infrastructure build-out, and it's on Slide 22. And we think, in the Appalachian Basin, that occurs at about 2016. So I think all that stuff works out. And once it does work out, then it's where's the low-cost gas. The other thing that low-cost gas has done, it's not only going to be exported, but it's displacing coal for power generation. It's displacing oil, the feedstock for petrochemical. Displacing a little bit of oil to feedstock for transportation. The other thing low-cost Marcellus gas is doing is displacing high-cost gas in plays like the Haynesville and Barnett and Woodford and other areas where you've seen the rig counts come down and the production from those fields come off significantly. So I think all of those things are happening. Back to your question about maximum pain, I think, again, our team has done a good job, the marketing team working with the operations team to make sure that we can move our gas between now and then. I think companies that haven't done that maybe haven't felt maximum pain. But I think it's another competitive advantage and another differentiation for Range. So anybody else on our team want to add to what I said? Or did I...", "Chad L. Stephens", "It's Chad. I couldn't have answered any better, but I will say that where commodity prices are right now, we know the demand is coming. It's just a matter of when will it come and at what levels. So with that being said, you got to look at the curve and see at what price are you able to drill and deliver the supply to meet that demand. So you'll see the curve play out as that demand -- as the market starts seeing that demand take traction between the LNG exports, power gen in the Southeast, Mexican exports, we're displacing gas from Canada. It's happening. It's just a matter of exactly when the markets will see it coming, at what price to be able to supply that demand.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes. And again, I think it's not that far out there, weather clearly plays an issue. I read something from AccuWeather that, hopefully, it's snowing in parts of the country on Halloween or at least raining and cold. So that's -- from our perspective, it's a good thing. I feel bad for some of the kids trick-or-treating, but that's helpful in the short run. And then it's back to differentiation for Range. We have that firm transportation and supply to bridge us through those harder periods, Dan, that you mentioned. And then in addition, we have contracts that none of our competitors have in terms of some of the liquids, which give us an uplift starting in the first quarter of '15, not that far out. Plus the weather, if we get any normal winter, though. It's not that far out. And then, again, it's an advantage for us so...", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Okay. I'll conclude on the same themes I discussed in my opening comments. Fundamentally, we believe that Range is a simple story. Range has the largest acreage position in the core to play, largely in the stacked pay area in Southwest Pennsylvania. We have the wells identified, the field infrastructure being built and the necessary takeaway capacity contracted to grow 20% to 25% each year to triple our current production to 3 Bcfe per day and beyond. The acreage position largely covers the most perspective liquids resources in the basin, with necessary transport and export facilities being built to handle our multiyear growth.", "We want to thank our shareholders for their support. We believe that Range will be a leader in building shareholder value. Thanks for participating on the call.

This call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. ", "Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. ", "At this time I would like turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney Waller", "Thank you, Adam. Good morning and welcome. Range reported results for the 2014 with record production and reserves and a continuing decrease in unit costs which will set us up -- our operation for 2015. The order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, President and CEO; Ray Walker, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Range did file our 10-K yesterday with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on our website under the Investor tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition we have posted on our website supplemental tables which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and reconciliation of reported earnings to our adjusted non-GAAP earnings that are discussed on the call today.", "Now let me turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you, Rodney. In 2014 Range achieved some key milestones that I believe position the company well for the future. Range recorded record level of production, reserves, revenue, net income, cash flow and cash flow per share in 2014. Thanks to continued cost structure improvements and steady production growth despite declining realized prices our cash flow and cash flow per share have increased. 2015 is setting up to be a challenging year. Fortunately, we did several things in 2014 that will help us in 2015. ", "With the redemption of our fixed rate 8% bond with the proceeds from an equity offering coupled with the cash proceeds we received from our Conger for Nora swap we ended 2014 with less debt than 2013. Debt per Mcfe of proved reserves was $0.30 at year end 2014 compared to the prior year at $0.038. Last fall we restructured and extended our senior bank facility for five years to 2019 and increased our borrowing base from $2 billion to $3 billion. We have no bonds maturing until 2020. ", "We have continued with our capital and operating efficiencies. In 2014 we improved our operating efficiency by decreasing our unit cost $0.35 or 10% versus the prior year and expect continued improvement this year. Our capital efficiency improved as we continue to drill longer laterals, and more frac stages per lateral and utilized improved targeting of the lateral. We believe this trend will also continue in to 2015. ", "We currently have hedged approximately 65% of our projected 2015 natural gas production with a $4 floor and approximately 77% of our projected oil production with a $90 and $0.57 floor. ", "On the natural gas liquid side Mariner East project is still projected to be on time with the start up in the third quarter of this year. When fully operational, even with today\u2019s pricing, given Range specific contracts and the combined benefits from propane and ethane this is projected to be approximately a $90 million uplift as compared to selling the ethane as natural gas net of all transportation and processing fees.", "In 2014 we grew production 24%, we grew reserves 26% and we ended 2014 by testing our first Utica well in Washington County at a rate of 59 million cubic feet per day which we believe is a new record for any well in any horizon in the Appalachian Basin. ", "As I previously mentioned we accomplished a lot in 2014 that will help us in 2015. We also have recently taken additional steps to help drive our performance in 2015 and 2016. We cut our 2015 capital budget to $870 million. This is approximately $700 million reduction from 2014. Given the quality of our assets and team, coupled with continuing improved capital efficiencies we are targeting 20% growth for 2015 even with the reduced capital. Importantly this growth occurred sequentially throughout the year which sets up Range well for 2016. ", "We also made a tough decision to close our Oklahoma City office and operate our mid-continent properties out of Fort Worth, given that approximately 97% of our capital is currently targeted to Appalachia we believe this is the right decision for the company and it will lead to better capital allocation for Range and improved integration of technology coupled with cost savings. ", "Range\u2019s advantage given our core acreage position in the Marcellus, we have approximately 125 million net acres of stacked pay potential in southwest and northeast Pennsylvania that is prospective for Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian. Plus our acreage position is further advantage in that we can selectively drill -- direct drilling capital towards the dry, wet or super-rich portion of the plays. Coupling this with our processing pipeline takeaway capacity and unique NGL marketing agreements, Range is well positioned for 2015, 2016 and beyond. ", "Gas demand is projected to increase in 2015 from coal plant retirements, gas exports to Mexico and later this year LNG exports. Given the large capital cuts from a large number of companies in our industry which is resulting in a rapidly declining rig count and deferred completions we may see a production response in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids later this year. The combination of slowing supply growth coupled with increasing demand should help bring the market closer in balanced this year. I will now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr.", "Thanks Jeff. While we are focused on the headwinds that we faced in 2015 when we pause to look back at 2014, 2014 was a record year across many aspects of our operations. We set records in production, reserves, cash flow and earnings along with significant improvement in cost structure and capital efficiency. We continue to see great results in well performance in both Southwest and Northeast Pennsylvania and like Jeff said we completed our first Washington County Utica Well. While it\u2019s only a single well based on the early results and all the previous data we have approximately 400,000 net acres in what we believe to be the core of the dry Utica and gives Range another significant growth opportunity to add to our core positions in the Marcellus and Upper Devonian and Southwest Pennsylvania. ", "In 2014 we also put together both [indiscernible] as the Nora field in Virginia, giving us control of operations and the early results were outstanding. We have the ability to significantly grow that asset in one of the best gas markets on the East Coast in the future and in the Midcontinent area we saw continued confirmation of the geologic modeling in the Chat play along the Nemaha Ridge leading to some of the best well performance to-date in that play. ", "I am also really proud of all of our employees for working all of 2014 without a loss time incident; safety, environmental protections and regulatory compliance are a core philosophy at Range and I want to personally congratulate everyone across the company for a job well done in 2014. We had a great year adding reserves at record low drill bit, F&D cost while decreasing the pud percentage and the startup of Mariner East early propane was another significant step in our liquids marketing strategy in Appalachian further positioning Range with unique and advantage opportunities.", "Recognizing the challenging commodity price environment that Jeff described in his remarks I know most of you today are primarily focused on our plans for \u201915. As we announced previously we set the capital budget at $870 million, which is 46% lower than our 2014 CapEx and we\u2019ve targeted year-over-year production growth of 20%. Nearly 95% of that budget is directed towards the Marcellus with over 90% of those dollars directed to Southwest Pennsylvania. 85% of our total capital is directed to the drill bit for 2015 as we significantly decreased our planned spending on land exploration and seismic. ", "We are able to make these changes and still target 20% growth for several reasons. Let me walk you through just a few of them. Number one we have an experienced team and great leadership with a proven track record of growing production and reserves consistently with one of the lowest cost structures in one of best plays in the industry. This has been our philosophy at Range for many years. ", "Number two most importantly and one of my favorite sayings, the rock rules, and this has proven to be the case throughout history across many plays and through multiple commodity price cycles. It simply means that where you find the best reservoir quality, meaning the best rock the economics are substantially better than non-core acreage. And when a company can maintain a low cost structure in the core play that company can sustain its growth at attractive economics across the up and down cycles of commodity prices.", "Range has what we believe is a core position in the Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica allowing us to focus capital in those areas with the best economics, whether they are dry, wet or super-rich and continue to achieve production growth in 2015 and beyond. And number three Range has had a consistent strategy of 20% to 25% growth at a low cost structure for many years. This has allowed us to implement innovative, attractive and long-term marketing and midstream arrangements that position us well for what we face going forward. ", "It has allowed us to keep our balance sheet strong and maintain liquidity. This strategy has also allowed our operating teams to achieve continued improvements in well performance and operational efficiencies while at the same time lowering our cost structure and we expect to continue to see those improvements going forward. ", "So getting into some details about 2015 let me start with our Southern Marcellus shale division. For 2015 we\u2019re planning to turn the shales approximately 101 Marcellus wells, 35 dry, 40 wet and 26 super rich with average completed lateraling of over 6,000 feet with 30 stages. Well timing is expected to be similar to the prior years and therefore production growth profile is also expected to be similar with sequential growth quarter by quarter throughout the year giving us momentum as we go into 2016. To help investors in forecasting Range\u2019s production growth we\u2019ve updated our presentation for each area in the Marcellus for specific type curves that are representative of the wells planned to be turned to shales [ph] rather than the wells planned to be drilled as we\u2019ve previously shown. ", "The 2015 type curves as you\u2019ll find in our updated presentation on the website correspond to how our wells are planned to be produced and support our expectation of 20% growth for 2015. As we\u2019ve described many times in the past it\u2019s our practice to focus on optimizing our gathering system based on managing our cost structure to provide the best overall project returns. This results in lower initial rates to sales and flatter at times as the gathering system is built out overtime and new processing plants and compressors are installed. ", "Actual performance as it pertains to the overall project is what matters and in Southwest Pennsylvania in the current environment we believe our well performance and returns are some of the best. Importantly Range\u2019s EUR projection in each of the Marcellus area has increased in 2015 compared to the prior year estimate, while total well cost has come down again illustrating quality of our Marcellus acreage and the continued improvements in capital efficiency. ", "In the past we\u2019ve made substantial enhancements to our completion designs such as improved lateral targeting, RCS, enhanced asset placement, greener additives, super surfactants and substantial reservoir modeling, both historical and predictive just to name a few. These enhancements have led to bigger EURs and lower costs year-after-year. We\u2019ll be continuing with that focus on the innovation in new technology going forward and I believe we\u2019ll continue to see positive changes in 2015 and beyond. ", "Illustrating a specific example of this, I\u2019ll call your attention to a new slide in our presentation, slide number 35 which follows up on a couple of wells that we talked about several quarters ago. We drilled two in-fill wells on an existing Marcellus pad that has been provisioning for over two years. By applying the new designs and better targeting the initial sales of those new wells was significantly higher than the existing wells as we previously reported. After almost a year of production the new wells on average have yielded 53% more than the original wells and we should not forget that on a normalized basis the new wells were $850,000 less per well. This example illustrates just one aspect that the capital efficiencies, improved well performance and resulting economics that we\u2019ve demonstrated to-date and can expect to see in future years. ", "I\u2019ll call your attention to slide number eight and slide number nine in our updated presentation to point out efficiencies that we\u2019ve achieved over the past several years. Namely in the Southwest Pennsylvania area, since 2011 as compared to \u201915 we\u2019ve seen a 114% increase on lateral lengths with a 57% reduction in total well cost per foot of lateral. For 2015 as compared to \u201914 we\u2019re planning 20% longer laterals with a 37% reduction in total well cost per foot of lateral. Even though our current 2015 plan turns to sales of few less wells as compared to last year we\u2019re actually planning to pump about the same number of frac stages. This illustrates continued efficiency improvements resulting in lower cost but also results in a consistent activity level allowing us to continue to capture improved service and supply pricing. ", "Looking at pricing across the supply chain on an apples-to-apples basis, assuming no efficiency improvements we now have arrangements in place that have reduced our estimated 2015 well cost by 23% to 25% as compared to December 2014 pricing. We have seen reductions in pricing across all services and supplies and we believe we'll see more improvements as the activity continues to decrease across the industry. Let me point out again that we've embedded in our 2015 plan well cost improvements from high grading our program, continued improvements in designs, efficiencies and operations and the reduction in service and supply cost that we currently have in hand. ", "When you add all these together you achieve the 37% decrease in total well cost per foot of lateral that I described earlier. If we see further reductions in service and supply pricing, our total well cost will decrease further. This of course combined with the diversity of our large core position in southwest Pennsylvania allows us to grow with good economics in 2015 whether it's ground [indiscernible]. As a further update on the Utica we're still planning to drill two more wells this year. We believe the total well cost for the second well will be around $13 million and we'll still include some additional science. It's still very early in the program but I believe as time goes on and we drill more wells we could see the cost come down another 15% to 25% as operational efficiencies and design improvements kick in. ", "The play 11H, which holds a record IP of 59 million a day is now producing at our designed constrain of 20 million a day and albeit very early and with only a few weeks of production the well is meeting initial expectations. Just like I discussed earlier current production facilities for these wells are designed to optimize the long-term flow and project economics. The first well will be produced to sales on an interruptible basis until this summer when new infrastructure is completed. The second well is planned to come online about that same time and the third well is planned to be drilled later in the year. ", "In Northeast Pennsylvania on slide nine, you can see that the lateral length has increased 100% since 2011 with a corresponding 63% decrease in total well cost per lateral foot. For 2015 as compared to '14 we're increasing lateral lengths by 18% with a 20% decrease in total well cost per foot of lateral. The team there had a great year and we saw a 44% increase in our 90 day rates with a 30% reduction in well cost totally attributable to operational efficiencies and improved well designs that were implemented in 2014. We're planning a one to two rig program this year resulting an about 14 well to sales and we expect those improvements that we saw in 2014 will continue. ", "We\u2019ve cut the CapEx in the midcontinent division to approximately $26 million resulting in a CHAT [ph] well utilizing targets from the geologic model that has been developed over the past couple of years. As Jeff mentioned we've made the difficult decision to close the Oklahoma City division office and we'll now operating the property which is approximately 360,000 net acres and 80 million a day of production with our Fort Worth based operations team. The field officers across Oklahoma and in the Texas Panhandle will now report to Fort Worth. ", "In Nora, we have the distinct advantages of an asset where we either own the minerals or sale by production combined with having a very flat decline and receiving some of the best gas prices in the country. Our plan for 2015 is simply to complete our inventory of wells drilled in late 2014 along with minimal maintenance capital resulting in a total spend of about $15 million with about 25 new wells turned to sales. ", "In only a few short months since taking over the operations the team has implemented designs and techniques resulting in some of the best results we seen in that field and you can see some of those results on slide 45 in the presentation. 465,000 net acre position has a tremendous inventory of low risk projects combined with exploration potential for the coming years. Again this is an asset that we believe we can ramp to significant volumes with attractive economics in the future. ", "In summary our message today is that we have a great team with a proven track record. We have a large and consolidated position in the core of one of the best plays in the world and history has proven over and over that rock rules. We continually improved our cost structure setting us up well to continue to deliver economic growth in the current environment. Our plan of growing at 20% to 25% for many years has enabled us to plan and execute innovative and attractive marketing and midstream arrangements that position us well. We have the balance sheet strength and liquidity to support the operational plan. And finally we have a plan for 20% growth in 2015 at great value by achieving growth consistently and sequentially quarter-by-quarter at attractive economics. All positioning us for growth into 2016 and forward as commodity prices improve.", "Now over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny", "Thanks, Ray. The fourth quarter closed down an excellent financial year for Range. Revenue, cash flow and cash flow per share were all sequentially higher than the third quarter of this year and also significantly higher than the fourth quarter of last year, while total unit costs were lower. For all of 2014 we set record highs for revenue, EBITDAX, cash flow and cash flow per share. And while we understand that everyone is keenly focus on current commodity prices and 2015 budgets we should not overlook these record 2014 results as they properly position Range for a more challenging 2015.", "So starting with the income statement; the fourth quarter was much like prior quarters, where we offset lower oil, gas and NGL prices with higher production volumes and lower costs. Our net realized price per Mcfe was 17% lower than the fourth quarter of last year but production was 26% higher and unit costs were 11% lower and that drove our strong quarterly performance.", "Reported net income was $284 million for the quarter benefiting from a $341 million pretax mark-to-market gains on our hedge book. Fourth quarter earnings calculated using analyst methodology which eliminate these non-cash mark-to-market entries was $65 million or $0.39 per fully diluted share.", "Cash flow for the fourth quarter was $273 million, 8% higher than last year and cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.64. EBITDAX for the fourth quarter came in at $310 million, 5% higher than last year. Cash flow and cash flow per share for the full year of 2014 was just over $1 billion or $6.33 a share. EBITDAX for the full year was $1.2 billion and 2014 was the first year that cash flow topped the $1 billion mark. As Rodney mentioned earlier please reference the various reconciliation tables found on the Range website and earnings release for full reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP. ", "On the expense side, all of our fourth quarter expense items came in at or below guidance, reflecting heightened focus upon costs, as oil gas and NGL prices waned during the quarter. Special mentioned is the continue decline in our DD&A rate. DD&A rate for the fourth quarter was $1.20 per Mcfe, down from a $1.36 per Mcfe last year and $1.46 per Mcfe a year before that.", "The fourth quarter DD&A rate represents a 48% decline during the past five years from the peak rate of $2.41 in Mcfe back in 2009. We expect the DD&A rate to continue falling as we high grade our asset based and become even more capital efficient. While there are several non-material positive and negative non-recurring items passing through the income statement in the fourth quarter there is one item that is highly non-recurring. This item relates to the closing of Oklahoma City office that Ray and Jeff mentioned and the resulting $8 million accrual for severance costs.", "The office closing will reduce our total company wide headcount by approximately 8%. There are other overhead costs associated with the office closing besides severance and the first quarter results will likely include an additional accrual of approximately $8 million to account for these costs. When the closure is completed we expect an annual G&A reduction of approximately $15 million to $18 million or $0.04 per Mcfe. With these savings layered in, beginning in the second quarter of 2015.", "Jumping over to the balance sheet, the first number you may notice is that we ended the year 2014 with less debt than the end of 2013. Aggregate debt and leverage are both down from last year even though we added 2.1 TCF of proved reserves and grew production by 26%. The steps taken mid-year in 2014 to reduce leverage and interest carry by calling our highest cost notes has positioned us well for the current more challenging environment.", "Looking forward, our revised $870 million capital budget results in a very modest cash flow overspend which is easily funded by our recently renewed bank facility. At year-end 2014 we had over $1 billion in liquidity available under our $2 billion commitment and over 2 billion in available liquidity under our $3 billion borrowing base. ", "Another balance sheet number that you may notice is our retained earnings topping the $1 billion mark for the first time, considering that for six consecutive years we have seen our realized price per Mcfe come down, our cash flow and cash flow per share for the past six consecutive years has gone up we view retained earnings growth as yet another indicator of our improving capital productivity, the quality of our assets and our relentless focus on growth at low cost.", "Please reference our fourth quarter earnings release for detailed expense item guidance for the first quarter of 2015. The earnings release also contains summary details of our hedge positions on both commodities and basis for 2015, 2016 and 2017. Additionally detailed hedge volumes and price information may be found on our website. ", "To summarize 2014 brought record high revenue, operating income, cash flow and cash flow per share with record low cash unit costs. The progress we made in 2014 places us on firm ground as we enter 2015, with additional capital efficiencies and cost reductions still to come we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver consistent growth for many years. ", "Jeff back over to you. ", "Jeffrey L. Ventura ", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Ventura. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronic. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ron Mills of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Ronald Mills ", "Hey, Ray you talked about slides eight and nine and it shows that the cost improvement particularly adjusted for lateral length, it was a big decrease as expected, a much bigger decrease is expected in \u201815 versus \u201814. Can you talk about how much of that is related to the lower overall service cost environment versus ongoing efficiencies. I am just looking at the last bar and the well cost per lateral length and the pace of the decline is much greater in \u201815. ", "Ray N. Walker, Jr.", "Yeah, good morning Ron. Good question. The difference, when you look at those charts on page -- slides number eight and nine, what you've seen from 2011 to 2014 has pretty much been a factor of well design improvements, longer laterals, operational efficiencies and the capital efficiency that we have seen during that timeframe. ", "From 2011 seen through 2014 we really have never seen service and supply chain cost reductions. So the difference in the slope of that line, if you want to look at it that way, going from \u201814 to \u201815 is the service or the supply chain side of the pricing reductions that we're seeing. We're seeing discounts across all of the sectors, across all -- from drilling rigs all the way through every piece of it and I think the jury is still out on how much more of that we'll see during the year. But I think it will depend on activity across the industry but certainly with all of the capital reductions that we've seen across all the different plays we're taking advantage of those every opportunity we get. ", "But that's the big difference, so that what I quoted in my remarks, the 37% reduction that we're seeing from 2014 for the planned average in 2015 is really a combination of well design improvements, operational efficiencies, like we've seen in the past and we'll continue with of all those innovations and then the other is -- the thing this year is really the difference in well cost from the supply chain side of things. ", "Ronald Mills ", "Okay, great. And then later in the presentation you show each of the areas and you have the 2014 actual production versus the unrestricted type curves. Can you just give us a little bit color on what the restrictions are and is it just the build out of gathering and right-sizing the gathering for the long term as opposed to flowing unrestricted? And I assume your guidance is based off of how you are actually flowing them I suppose to the unrestricted type curves?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr.", "Right, right. Another great question. We have done a couple in our presentation this time. One is in 2014 we were showing you an unrestricted, unconstrained how you want to say a type curve that was based on the wells that we plan to drill that year. Going forward we are giving our predicted forecast for the wells based on all the other system that we have out there, the timing and so forth and we are basing on the mix on the wells that we are actually going to put to sales. So it will actually help the investors more correctly model our production forecast going forward and that is the big difference in the curves.", "Alan W. Farquharson", "Yeah, and Ron this is Alan Farquharson. With that I think we have covered a couple of things that and really talked about we are trying to make the forecast easier for people to model one. Two, I think at the end of the day what it looks -- what you are seeing is well EURs on a per normalized basis are exactly the same as what they were before. Overall, we are going to have higher EURs because that will be driven by longer laterals and we are also realizing the benefit of lower well cost. ", "With that this is the constrained situation if you want to call or restricted is really the result of success of the drilling programs that we have had over the last several years. It\u2019s, traditionally you design systems to maximize the overall value of the whole product as opposed to individual well economics. So with that we have kind of modeled everything from that standpoint. That\u2019s not to say we are not going -- we are going to stop to not plan improvements. We still think that they are going to able to realize some improvements going forward in terms of looping lines, additional compression. We have a plant coming on scheduled to come on in 2016. We are also looking at improving the pipeline hydraulics that are out there. ", "So we think with that there are also going to some improvements that hopefully we will be able to see over coming in 2015, 2016 and beyond but with that we believe this is great model to be able to get to the 20% growth that we have.", "Ronald Mills ", "Great. And then the optimized versus original curves on slide 35, is it fair to assume that the plan is to really do the 700 foot spacing going forward or are you still in early days?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr.", "What you will also see Ron in our presentation, the slide before that, on slide 34 is an update of the 500 foot space test that we had talked about several quarters ago, probably over a year ago and we are updating that. We now have basically five years of production almost and our original projections of about 80% of the thousand foot examples is still holding very true. What slide 35 -- what the example I called out in my remarks does is show you not only a version of that, but it also shows you the improvement in well designs and operational efficiencies and just better targeting, you know all of those impacts basically showing the two new wells on a normalized per foot of lateral basis produce 53% more production you know over a year\u2019s timeframe, then the original wells which were only two years par. ", "So I think going forward we have a mix of both of those cases. Now whether the spacing is 500 foot or 700 foot or 900 feet or what the ultimate space is going to be I think when you look at our core position at Southwest Pennsylvania it is very large and is very diverse. We go from super-rich all the way to dry and I think as we develop overtime you are going to see some areas in the liquid, I would think we are probably going to get wells closer together there and maybe not as close in the dry are but I don\u2019t think at this point in time we could say it is going to be only 500 because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the case. ", "But it\u2019s certainly going to be a lot more well in-fill well drilling and when we go back on those existing pads, what\u2019s -- it is really important to point the improvement in well performance that we are seeing but you can\u2019t also -- you can\u2019t forget the decrease in well cost. When you are looking at $850,000 less per well those economics are going to be outstanding going forward as we go back and redevelop those areas to fill in the gathering system as we get more room. Gathering costs will come down in those areas, those -- there\u2019s going to be some real upside for us going forward.", "Ronald Mills ", "Great. Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Just to summarize that a little bit, that slide 34 all those wells were drilled at the same time. So you had a pilot of 500 foot wells versus opposed to a thousand all drilled with old technology of five years ago and in-fill looks very attractive. However when the wells were wider spaced divisionally and then we\u2019ve gone back years later and in-filled rather than that in-fill well getting 80% of the original well it\u2019s actually better because the longer laterals, RCS, all the better landing, all the things that Ray said. So the in-fill wells rather than being a fraction of the original well are actually better. ", "Ronald Mills ", "Thanks again. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, this is John Attis [ph] speaking for Doug Leggate. We just had a couple of questions; apologize if they had already been asked. With regards to Mississippi Line is that even considered core anymore and if it\u2019s something that you can potentially consider divesting? And considering and what -- and if so when you look at Nora, I mean is there a possibility of -- what would you need to see in order to pick-up activity? And then my follow-up question is it looks like based on your new program for 2015 budget there is the possibility that you may generate free cash flow. If so where would you allocate the cash? Thank you. ", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "This is Jeff. Let me start and I would imagine you\u2019ll hear from two or three more other than me. Yeah, I think what you\u2019ve seen us do is focus our capital on the Marcellus where we have very strong returns, the ability to dry, wet and super rich. So we get -- and we get strong returns, we get good growth. It\u2019s also an area where there is an infrastructure ability to grow it, there\u2019s contracts in place. We have to hold acreages, a lot of different factors that blend in to that decision to focus in the Marcellus. ", "And I think if you step back and look at it, I would argue there are returns in the Marcellus there as good any play really in the U.S. today. So strong returns and yeah that\u2019s an area we need to drill to continue to hold to acreage which we\u2019ll do. But when you look at Nora it\u2019s a totally different decision. It\u2019s all HPP in fact it\u2019s better than that, in that we own the minerals under the bulk of it. So it has strong returns, strong economics and good gas markets but that\u2019s an area we have the ability to ramp up, when we\u2019re ready to do that, great asset. ", "I think we created a lot of value by putting it together. Again it\u2019s all the strength that Ray said. We put the two pieces together that creates value, we try new technology, there\u2019s some great slides in the book that show what those new wells look like in the appendix. And we still get a premium to NYMEX there and we have the ability to grow and ramp that and probably one of the best if not the best gas market in the U.S.", "In the mid-continent the decision to slowdown there was given the returns that we have in the other areas, we were putting like I said in my notes approximately the number was, 97% or so plus or minus more capital in Appalachia. So we thought the most efficient thing to do is to really operate those properties out of Fort Worth, there\u2019s significant G&A savings that Roger mentioned, several million dollars a year in savings. We still think the properties have potential, big footprint stack play, a lot of that\u2019s controlled. ", "Let me switch gears a little bit and just talk abstract, in the abstract you talked about -- when you look at asset sales, clearly over the last several years we have sold almost $3 billion worth of properties. So if we ever get to the point where we think those assets are worth more to somebody else than us then clearly we\u2019ve done that multiple times. ", "And to be honest with you, it\u2019s early in the morning and I don\u2019t remember all the other questions. I\u2019ll turn it over to Ray now. ", "Roger S. Manny", "Yeah, John this is Roger, yeah, your free cash flow question, I think your modeling is correct. It\u2019s a very, very modest overspend by projection, the lowest overspend we\u2019ve had that I can remember. And the interesting thing about it is it\u2019s not contingent on some asset sale. So there\u2019s not sale risk in that number. It\u2019s not contingent on some capital market transaction, so there is no market risk in that number. And you\u2019re right more cost savings and/or higher prices could easily flip us to cash flow positive and if we find ourselves in that position we\u2019ve got a lots of places to put the capital and we\u2019ll take that decision at that point in time. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "I appreciate it. Thank you. ", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you. ", "Ray N. Walker, Jr.", "By the way a little color, we\u2019re sitting here looking at the window in Fort Worth and it\u2019s an intense snowfall. It\u2019s extremely rare for those of you that don\u2019t know Fort Worth, it\u2019s very beautiful. Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Holly Stewart of Howard Weil. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Hello?", "Operator", "I'm sorry. Our next question comes from the line of Phillips Johnston with Capital One. Please go ahead with your question.", "Phillips Johnston", "Hey, guys thanks. In your prepared remarks you've referenced sequential production growth throughout this year and I'm wondering how the quarterly progression of that growth is expected to look like in the second, third and fourth quarter. Is it expected to be fairly smooth at close to a 5% sequential per quarter growth rate or would you expect some lumpiness in the progression?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yeah, Phillips, it's a great question, and I think it's -- we still feel very comfortable with the 20% growth for the capital that we said. We have given you the first quarter guidance. So by definition it\u2019s kind of backend loaded. I think if you look at the company historically it's looked that way for the last decade. So I would just look at the last few years and model it that way. ", "Phillips Johnston", "Okay, and then as we sort of look into next year it sounds like, Jeff you're pretty confident that you can sort of maintain that 20% growth rate. Obviously drilling efficiencies are a tailwind for your growth rate and you have some mix shift from the mid-cont Appalachia, but can you give us some comfort as to how you can continue to grow at that level despite the fact that your planned well count this year is down more than 25% year-over-year. ", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yeah, well I think it's fixed to when you look at the well, the quality of the wells have gotten better year-after-year and we've talked about that a lot. For longer laterals this year we're targeting 6,000 foot on average roughly and I think you'll see the laterals progress with time to longer laterals better technology, better landing, better capital efficiencies. And if the pricing, share pricings holds in there with this and I think we'll be in pretty good shape. ", "So I think the other thing is our probably like other, a lot of other companies for 2015 our production curve will progress throughout the year towards backend loaded. So it gives us a good start on 2016. So I think that coupled with capital efficiencies puts us in a position where gas today, we still feel that targeting 20% growth is very reasonable. ", "Phillips Johnston", "Okay, thanks Jeff. ", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Now our next question comes from the line of Holly Stewart of Howard Weil. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Holly Stewart", "All right, let's try this again, can you hear me?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes.", "Holly Stewart", "Okay great. Maybe just switching gears to NGL realization, because you guys talked about in your presentation, how in the second half of the year there will be a higher percentage based off of natural gas and obviously the fourth quarter NGL realizations were a lot better, I think than everything was expecting. So could you just maybe walk us through how to think about that in 2015 and beyond?", "Chad L. Stephens ", "Yeah hi, Holly, this is Chad. So there is probably three things that affected or influenced fourth quarter NGL realizations or improvements. One, you got to realize or remember that range has a PLP processing arrangement with Mark West. So as prices come down the fee we're paying Mark West comes down, which improves our realizations. October, November the market saw little bit colder temperatures so demand for propane, heating demand for propane increased. So propane prices improved a little bit. And approximately half our NGL barrel is ethane and 80% of our ethane is currently tied to natural gas index as we sell on our Mariner West project, all of the ethane is sold on a gas equivalent and some of the ethane on ATAX [ph] is sold at a gas equivalent price. So that's why you saw that realizations improve in fourth quarter. ", "Holly Stewart", "Okay, that helps. And then maybe just kind of a bigger picture question for Jeff. You've laid out in the slide deck, you kind of going from 1.4, I think it is to 2.5 Bcf a day of transportation agreements between 2015 and '18. So maybe strategically can you reconcile that growth in sort of ST capacity to the growth in expected production, should kind of prices remain weak. ", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yeah, I think one thing we've had for a number of years now is a long range plan. So we have a very integrated process when we look at that production profile that we expect and well integrated with the Chad and the marketing team in terms of the amount of firm transportation that we need to hit those targets. And it's not just on the gas side but on the liquid side as well. We do have -- so we have good plan, capital efficiencies like we said will continue to improve. I think you'll see us move out to longer laterals, more frac stages, all those types of technologies that help on that side, so our capital efficiency should improve. ", "I think another key thing to think about too is really think natural gas demand is going to improve with time as well. And I mentioned it in my notes early on with the mass retirements on power plants start kicking in, in the spring of this year, increased exports to Mexico and LNG starting up later this year, we think demand will be up 1 to 2 bs this year and then we think for every year thereafter demand increases 3 to 4 bcf per year and there is a slide in our book that points that out, peaking out we think the incremental gas demand could be 20 bcf by 2020. ", "So we think there is going to be a lot of gas demand and gas is going to be a good place to be and we're in the highest quality, in the core of the highest quality best gas play out there with the ability to drill wet, dry and super rich as well as Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian.", "Holly Stewart", "Thank you, gentlemen. ", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Brian Singer", "Thank you. Good morning. ", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Good morning. ", "Ray N. Walker, Jr.", "Good morning. ", "Brian Singer", "Just one question on how you're thinking about longer term, Marcellus production relative to your takeaway capacity. What scenario do you see relative to the very large takeaway that you have lined up to get gas out of the basin for you to be producing above that number versus below that number and how are you thinking about scenarios in what to do with, in terms of contracting additional takeaway capacity, if your plans are to produce above that in 2018 or what you would do with any excess takeaway capacity if you're producing below that?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "I think if you look at us now that we're basically fully covered and well integrated for the plan that we have. And right now there is a benefit to having all that from transportation, there is value to that portfolio and yeah I think we have a very forward thinking team that's been able to line up pieces and let me flip it over to Chad to talk about that a little bit more. ", "Chad L. Stephens ", "Yes, thanks. So getting to where we are today the firm transport capacity we have through 2018 has been a very thoughtful methodical process getting with our drilling teams and understanding what our volumes are going to be up through 2018 and beyond. And when you look at slide 37 in our presentation we show regionally where that firm transportation is and what we deem is relatively cheap firm transportation costs, that dovetails or fits real well with our projected volumes. ", "Going forward we think that there is release capacity markets we've already been involved in and getting again relatively cheap or inexpensive firm transport to layer in to the areas we want to get our markets too. Obviously slide 37 shows our main objective is to try to get as much of our volume out of Appalachia into other areas Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast and in the future we want to try to do that as well. We think that with rig rates coming down, CapEx budgets being cut, volume -- projected volumes will be coming down in those companies that committed to firm transportation volumes will not be using all of that capacity. ", "So we're going to take advantage of that and get into the release capacity markets and when needed speak up for some of that released capacity. We're also in discussions with some of the midstream companies about adding layering in additional strategic firm transportation projects they would fit our volumes and our needs again getting the volumes out of the Appalachia basin to other areas of the country where the basis has not been quite as volatile and we don't think it will be in the future. ", "Brian Singer", "Got it. Thanks. And then with regards to the cost reductions that you seem to be showing here at least on per thousand foot of lateral basis in the super rich and southwest wet Marcellus plays. Can you talk to how much of that's lower cost and what the split is in terms of what you would call -- we would call cyclical service cost reduction that maybe in a higher oil and gas environment would go away versus what you would consider secular. ", "Ray N. Walker, Jr.", "Sure Brian. It\u2019s Ray. In my remarks I tried to do that as best we could. But one of the things I said was that on an apples-to-apples basis if you look at the contracts that we -- I call them arrangements, if you look at the arrangements we have in place today with all our folks on the -- or our partners on the supply chain side of things and you look apples-to-apples compared to December of 2014 through today which is what we have in hand again, our well costs are down 23% to 25%. ", "The operational efficiencies, design improvements renewed technology all those things that we have done over the past four years are going to continue going in \u201915. So when you add those together that\u2019s where you achieve that big change that you are seeing from \u201914 to \u201915 which is a bigger decrease then the slope of that line have been previously adding those two together gets you a 37% decrease on a per foot basis. ", "We haven\u2019t put that in our total well cost basis just because all the lateral lengths are different and it is just too difficult to talk about from that standpoint. But again the service price reductions and supply side of thing reductions, those add up to about 23% to 25% on an apples-to-apples basis compared to December of \u201914.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And I think if you look on slide eight and nine there is a lot of detail and you can kind of see like Ray mentioned earlier there wasn\u2019t much of change in service industry cost from 2011 to 2014.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr.", "If anything it went up.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yeah, so those are pure operational efficiencies.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr.", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from -- GMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.", "Sameer Uplenchwar", "Thanks for squeezing me in guys and congrats on a great quarter.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you.", "Sameer Uplenchwar", "My first question it relates to slide 17, if I look at the IRRs now, I understand the upcoming balance between the super-rich and wet gas window driven by the oil pricing but how does this change the plan longer-term plan for Range going forward with gas competing well with the super-rich and rich window? And then I have a follow-up.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, let me start and Alan might have some follow-up. But one of the advantage we have is we do have a big acreage position in Dry, Wet and Super-Rich and again across those three things as well as up and down through the various horizons, Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian. So we have some ability to shift capital back and forth to try to drive further capital efficiency and better returns. So that is an advantage of the portfolio and the size of the footprint that we have and we will do that with time. ", "Obviously as prices swing, as oil swing high to low or gas swings high to lower NGLs it is going to affect the economics and we will do our best to capture the most optimum returns that we can. Alan, do you want to add to that?", "Alan W. Farquharson", "Yeah, really I think comes down to -- it\u2019s kind of - to add on to what Jeff said we have the opportunity to be able to drill in any one of the three areas, number one. Number two, you saw that in 2014 as well that we had a balanced portfolio. We talked about that early in the year last year and so you saw a mix of wells that are going to be in there. I think it still comes down to well performance is still really strong, recoveries are still on a normalized basis still the same but overall EURs are going up cost are coming down so as we continue to work to that process we are going to continue to put the capital in the area in the areas it is going to give us a best return that we can realize. But I think you see those two things really coming at the end of the day and it just allows us more enhancement to the portfolio.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And that is an advantage of having a really large footprint in the core deploy with high quality mark with a strong team. Through multiple years but you can make those kind of continue to improve.", "Sameer Uplenchwar", "Okay. And the follow-up is, middle of last year there was plan to get to investment grade by middle of \u201916 maybe late \u201816 how has that plan changed with the commodity coming down now?", "Roger S. Manny", "Yeah, hi, Sameer it\u2019s Roger. Yeah, I don\u2019t believe we have put a date on which we desire to be investment grade and agencies tend to take -- their customer telling them that. So there was never a firm date but you are exactly right we are on a trajectory and still are to become investment grade in the future, with sort of the lowering of the tide effecting oil companies it appears that it\u2019s going to take a little longer than it otherwise would have us to be there. When we look at our core metrics and the fact that were our bond trade. I mean every one of our bonds, even though coupons are like 5%, all of our bonds are trading over 100 cents on the dollar. I mean our spread to treasury on our longest notes are about 298. So our bonds are trading right at the crossover mark. ", "So I think the people that really understand credit liquidity are voting with the market and we know we\u2019re still on that trajectory. But again we\u2019re not going to project when that might occur in the future.", "Sameer Uplenchwar", "Perfect. Thanks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We are nearing the end of today\u2019s conference. We\u2019ll go to Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley for our final question. Please go ahead with your question.", "Drew Venker", "Good morning, everyone. Was hoping to get a little bit more color on the Utica program. You mentioned building out some infrastructure. Are you expecting to produce that well at a higher rate once the infrastructure\u2019s in place?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Good question. We\u2019re excited about the Utica, the first well, it\u2019s only been on line a few weeks. We purposely designed the production facilities to basically limit that well at 20 million a day, because again we tend to focus at Range on the long-term project economics and not initial production rates or anything like that, because the projects at the end of the day is what\u2019s most important. For the first half of this year that first well is actually producing on an interruptible basis as we have room to kind of [indiscernible]. ", "We are currently building a new pipeline segment that will take it directly to the big pipe essentially, that will be finished sometime this summer and that is also corresponding with about the time we believe -- and all this is plus or minus a month at this point. But that corresponds with about the same time that the second well is ready for initial production. We will design those facilities for that second well to also limit it to about 20 million a day, but we do expect for the last half of the years that both those wells will be able to produce at their full rate which is going to again be limited to 20 million a day each, but we think they\u2019ll come online this summer time and produce the rest of the year on an uninterruptible basis.", "And the third well we\u2019ll drill later in the year. At this point it\u2019s too early to tell we are kind of in the planning process and permitting process to know if it will actually produce this year or not, but it will be somewhere around the end of the year or beginning of next year when the third well\u2019s ready. Second well, we think we can do at about $13 million, we still got some science in it and again I am fully expect and I think our team is pretty pumped about what we see so far and they think we believe that as we go into that program that we can lower those costs another 15% to 25% and now as we take in well designs and different things that we learn and going through first couple of wells. And I\u2019ll also point out that third well, it will be in that same area, but it will actually be on a different pad, is the current plan.", "Drew Venker", "Okay, understood. So it\u2019s obviously very early. How much production history or well control would you want before moving the Utica into development mode or before your let\u2019s say allocating a significant amount of capital to the play?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Well, we have a lot of information about the Utica. We had, as we talked about in quarters past, a lot of old trend Black River tests and a lot more test wells that were done back in the very early days before the Marcellus even. So we have a lot of log data. Industry has certain drilled a lot of Utica wells all around at this point. There is enough production history now to prove out some other things on pressure and the reservoir parameters that we were looking at. ", "So the Utica is a lot different than the Marcellus, we won\u2019t have to be stepping out and delineating acreage like we did it in the early days of the Marcellus. This is going to be more of a manufacturing tied process. We\u2019ll actually be able to just to put existing pads with existing infrastructure and start layering those wells in overtime.", "We generally like to see, I mean we\u2019ll update you quarter-b y-quarter as we see the production from these wells, just like we did in old days of the Marcellus and I think once we\u2019ve seen three six to nine months of production on these various wells we will be pretty comfortable with what we have going forward and at that point I think it's going to be a factor of the economics. It's going to be pretty easy to grow with those kind of wells. It's got to be -- the economics are going to be very competitive and I think that we'll have to look at what the market is telling us at that point, \u201816 and beyond as we develop these plans as what we do next. But it's another really strong option for us and that's what we like. ", "Drew Venker", "Thanks for the color. ", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for closing remarks. ", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "2014 was a record year for Range. Cash flow was over $1 billion for the first time in the company's history, reserves reached a new record level of 10.3 Tcfe with the Conger-Nora swap we now have operational control over essentially all of our property. We ended the year with lower debt and improved bank facility with plenty of liquidity and no bond maturities until 2020. 2014 was also a challenging and difficult year with falling commodity prices that have continued into 2015 with our current plan to spend approximately $700 million less in 2015 and 2014 and still target 20% growth, we believe that we'll be one of the most capital efficient companies in our industry. ", "These capital efficiency coupled with our large footprint in the core of the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian and the optionality of being able to drill dry wet and super rich acreage have us well positioned for 2015, 2016 and beyond.

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney L. Waller", "Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome.", "Range reported results for the first quarter 2015 with record production, a continuing decrease in unit cost and some outstanding well results. The order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, Chairman, President and CEO; Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ray Walker, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins and the reconciliation of reported earnings to our adjusted non-GAAP earnings that are discussed on the call.", "Now let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Thank you, Rodney. I'm going to begin my remarks with some macro comments about our industry and then focus specifically on Range.", "Starting with the macro, as you all know, U.S. gas supply has increased ahead of demand causing low gas prices in most of the U.S. and negative basis differentials in the Appalachian basin. We believe that over the last year, the U.S. gas market typically has been oversupplied by about 2 Bcf to 4 Bcf per day. However, we see positive things that are happening on both the demand and supply sides of the equation. On the demand side, I believe that most people would agree that additional natural gas demand is coming and coming in a very meaningful way.", "In our presentation on our website on Page 19, we have a projection on natural gas demand with time. The good news is that gas demand is expected to increase about 2 Bcf per day this year. This projected 2015 increase in gas demand as driven by the conversion of coal-fired power generation to gas, increased industrial demand, plant exports of gas to Mexico and LNG exports from the Gulf Coast coming online.", "For 2016 through '20, natural gas demand is projected to increase by about 3 Bcf to 4 Bcf per day each and every year. It shows about 20 Bcf per day of incremental natural gas demand by 2020. There are multiple other reports that project natural gas demand with time in the report we reference as consistent with our internal work and within the range of other reports that I've seen.", "The other side of the equation is the supply side. The supply side can be broken into 2 pieces: natural gas associated with oil wells and natural gas from gas wells. We believe that prior to the recent oil rig count reduction, there was approximately 16 Bcf per day of natural gas being produced associated with oil production. That's almost the equivalent of the Marcellus and Utica combined. Of the 16 Bcf per day of natural gas production associated with oil, about 8 Bcf per day is estimated to be associated with shale oil or unconventional oil plays.", "For the first time in a long while, oil isn't $90 to $100 per barrel, it's roughly half that. The industry's response has been to cut their 2015 capital programs to about 40% to 50% of their 2014 budgets. Given these reductions so far, the oil rig count is down about 56% and appears to be going further. Given that moving oil through low permeability rock is harder than moving gas through low permeability rock, the first year declines of unconventional resource oil wells are much steeper than gas wells and typically are in the 70% to 90% range. Given the continuing steep drop in the rig count and typically steep first year declines of those oil wells, I believe that we'll see a production response in the second half of this year. Some are predicting that we'll see it before then and they may be correct. Not only will this help on the gas supply side, but since about 40% of all NGLs are derived from natural gas associated with oil production, it will help with the NGL supply as well.", "The other big piece of the supply equation is in Marcellus and Utica. Even in these plays, operators have typically cut their 2015 capital spending plans by about 40% to 50% versus 2014. The rig counts for both of these plays are down by about 42% and 44%, respectively. By late summer, some are forecasting that the rig count in the Marcellus and Utica may be down to about half of what it was last year. Cutting capital spending and cutting the rig count will affect production. In addition, the infrastructure is significantly constrained in the far Northeast portion of Pennsylvania. One pushback I get from this argument is that when the gas rig count plummeted in the second half of 2008 and beyond, the production response was unaffected and it kept going up into the right. I believe that it's different this time for multiple reasons. Back in 2008 timeframe, there were still vertical rigs drilling for gas. The operators dropped their vertical rigs first, and those rigs were not driving production. It was the horizontal rigs that were doing so. Today, there are no vertical rigs drilling the Marcellus or Utica, so decreasing the rig count should have an impact.", "The second thing that happened is the lateral lengths back in 2008 and early on were short, maybe 3,000 feet or less. As operators dropped horizontal rigs, they drilled longer and longer laterals with some operators now consistently drilling 8,000 to 10,000-foot laterals. In addition, the number of frac stages increased and the spacing between stages decreased and same concentrations went up. All of this led to higher production. I believe that today, operators who have consistently been drilling 8,000 to 10,000-foot laterals with reduced cluster spacing and high sand concentrations are in the later innings of the game.", "Combining the coming growing natural gas demand with the probable response on the supply side, the outlook for supply and demand coming in to balance and improving natural gas prices are on the horizon. In addition, given the significant infrastructure build-out underway in Appalachia, coupled with multiple companies moving their gas out of the basin and improved demand outlook, we believe the basis differentials in Appalachia should narrow and improve. Therefore, I believe pricing should get better later this year and on into 2016. Range is well-positioned for this upcoming event. We have the largest position in the core portion of the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian. This is the area where all 3 horizons are stacked on top of each other. It's also the area where there's an option to drill either wet or dry acreage. In total, we have about 1.6 million net acres of stacked pay potential. About 900,000 acres are dry and about 700,000 net acres are wet. We have some ability to move our drilling between these areas and horizons.", "Looking at the economics with strip pricing on Page 17, although the economics for the wet wells are good, currently the dry well economics are better. For 2015, we've moved more of our planned drilling into the dry area.", "The other key on the same page is the date in the second row, which speaks to the quality of the acreage. Range's EURs per thousand foot of lateral are best in the southwest portion of the play. And when considering the total Marcellus play, they're second only to Cabot. It's interesting to note that Range's and Cabot's lateral lengths are both about 6,000 feet, which is less than most everyone else in the play. Both companies EURs are tops in the play, which speaks to the quality of the rock. One upside for Range is that we only drilled a small number of our potential locations. And as we continue to drill longer laterals with time, our capital and operating efficiencies should continue to improve given that we are in the earlier innings of the game.", "Utica could be another enhancement to our capital efficiencies and returns. On Slide 14 of our presentation, there are 2 new bullets that we added to this slide. We, along with multiple other Utica operators, are members of the consortium for the Utica. We record our well and contributed the data to the consortium. The Utica well we drilled in Washington County, Pennsylvania, was calculated to have the highest gas in place of any of the analyzed consortium wells in Ohio, West Virginia or Pennsylvania. It also has the highest reservoir pressure of any horizontal Utica well drilled and some of the best permeability in the play. This combination of high gas in place, high pressure and high permeability for the Utica led the Range testing to Claysville Sportsmen's Club well at 59 million cubic feet per day, which is a record 24-hour rate for any well in the Utica or in the Marcellus. About 2 weeks prior to Range announcing this test rate, Hart published a summary of the top 10 shale wells in any play at any time. If our well had been included in the study, it would have been the #1 well. More importantly, this was -- been online at 20 million cubic feet per day on an interruptible basis for about 12 weeks and has produced about 1.2 Bcf so far. It's extremely early in its life but the performance so far is encouraging.", "As I mentioned previously, on a stack-pay basis, we have about 900,000 net acres of dry gas potential to drill and about 700,000 net acres of wet gas potential. I've seen some analysts paint all Appalachian NGLs with the same brush and value them all the same. Fortunately for Range, that's not true. There are 2 key items to consider: The first is a richness of the gas and the second is the sales contracts, the NGL they're sold under. Because we have the richest gas in the basin and what appear to be more favorable contracts than others, we receive a significant revenue uplift from our NGLs as shown on Page 18 of our presentation. Our peers might say their ethane should stay in the gas stream. And if their gas is leaner and if their contracts are not as favorable, maybe they should.", "For Range, we continue to build on our portfolio of agreements for all products, which spreads the market risk of our products across multiple pricing structures, multiple outlets and with multiple counter-parties. For 2015, the strategy is serving us well as more than 80% of our Range's ethane is tied to gas or oil-linked indices rather than Mont Belvieu. When Mariner East comes online in the third quarter, Range will be further advantaged as a producer exporting NGL products outside North America. In addition, our propane will be transported more efficiently on pipe rather than trucks and rail adding approximately $50 million to cash flow annually just on propane transport savings.", "Going forward, as we continue to grow in size and scale, we'll have the opportunity to find new markets, and I expect our teams will continue to find innovative ways to maximize cash flow. I'll now turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny", "Thank you, Jeff. Winter weather usually brings higher oil, natural gas and NGL prices paired with higher operating costs. Despite a colder than average winter, the first quarter of 2015 did not follow this pattern.", "Realized price for mcfe is 28% lower than last year's first quarter. However, 26% higher production and 15% lower unit cost combined to generate $423 million in first quarter revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales including cash-settled derivatives. This top line figure was only 10% below last year's first quarter, despite the headwind from 28% lower prices. The operating and administrative expense story for the first quarter is an exceptionally good one effectively bearing the brunt of much of the decline in prices.", "As I mentioned earlier, the winter weather of each year usually brings higher expenses as our field professionals cope with the challenges of an often brutally cold operating environment in Appalachia. This year was even colder than normal, but our operating teams really delivered. Not only did we beat all of our unit cost guidance figures, direct operating expense was lower than last year on an absolute basis as well.", "The same applies to G&A expense and interest expense during the first quarter, all below unit cost guidance and all below last year on an absolute dollar basis. Cash flow for the first quarter was $207 million and EBITDAX for the quarter came in at $244 million. Cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.24. These figures were 21%, 20% and 23%, respectively, lower than last year due to realized prices. First quarter book net income was $28 million, and earnings calculated using analyst methodology was $31 million, generating earnings of $0.19 per fully diluted share.", "The non-GAAP measures that I just mentioned, including EBITDAX and analyst earnings, are fully reconciled to the GAAP numbers in various supplemental tables, which may be found on the Range website under the Investors tab.", "Looking forward to the second quarter, please reference our first quarter 2015 earnings press release for detailed expense item guidance.", "Now turning to the balance sheet, our first quarter trailing 12-month debt-to-EBITDAX ratio was 2.9x, roughly equal to last year's figure of 2.8x and below the 3x figure from the year before. Despite lower realized prices, our first quarter leverage is essentially the same as prior years. Range added additional natural gas, oil and NGL hedges during the first quarter for the remainder of 2015 as well as additional hedge volumes for 2016 and 2017. Details of these additional hedges may be found in the earnings release, the 10-Q and the Investors tab on our website.", "The first quarter of 2015 reflects the impact of lower year-over-year prices for all of our products. However, the quarter also reflects an appropriate response to this environment by the company: strong production growth, significant reductions in cost on both the unit and absolute basis, additional hedges and continually improving capital efficiency regarding some of the best well results in our history.", "Ray, over to you.", "Ray N. Walker", "Thanks, Roger. At Range, we believe there are 3 key facts that differentiate us from our peers: Number one, we have a large and high-quality position that is low risk and repeatable. Having stack-pay potential of 1.6 million acres in the core of the highest hydrocarbon in place in the Appalachian basin opens many doors for us in the market. And historically, throughout this business, the rock rules. And our results indicate we've captured some of the best rock in North America.", "Number two, our team continues to lead the way in innovation while delivering great well performance and capital efficiency. And we believe our track record over the past several years supports that. And number three, we have product diversity with large positions in both liquids rich and dry gas. Coupled with our first mover advantage, low-cost transportation and favorable sales contract, this gives Range a unique and significant competitive advantage. Execution is the key in 2015, and we're on track with our planned $870 million CapEx budget and to achieve our targeted annual growth of 20%. Maintaining our low-cost structure and continuing to improve well performance is a core focus at Range. And even though Range is already one of the lowest cost operators, our cost metrics continue to improve. As Roger pointed out, our cost structure is improving on both an absolute and unit basis. Our operating teams are continuing to find ways of increasing efficiencies, enhancing our well designs and lowering cost, while achieving better and better well performance, all allowing us to get 20% growth from a bigger base with $700 million less capital than last year.", "For the first quarter, our production averaged 1.328 Bcf equivalent per day with 33% liquids and represented 4% growth over the fourth quarter of '14 and 26% growth compared to the first quarter of '14. Our growth profile for the next 3 quarters shows production being more heavily weighted to the third and fourth quarters, just as it has been in the past. And it should set us up well with momentum going into 2016. Guidance for the second quarter is 1.345 Bcf equivalent per day with approximately 30% liquids.", "In Southwest Pennsylvania on the drilling side, Range is in an excellent position regarding the terms on our drilling rigs. We're presently on well-to-well contracts on 6 of our 9 rigs. Of the 3 rigs that aren't well to well, all contract terms will expire within the next 4 months. This has allowed us to capture significant reductions in day rate and other services along with providing us flexibility in shifting rigs and capabilities around to optimize our fleet. We believe this gives our operating team a huge competitive advantage in driving down costs, introducing new technologies and improving the overall performance of the fleet.", "On the completion side of our operations, the team pumped over a thousand stages in the first quarter averaging over 6.5 stages per day. That's 84% more stages in the quarter and 43% more stages per day than the same quarter last year with 2 crews versus 1.6 crews last year. In March, they set a new record of 424 stages for the month with a new one-day record of 23 stages. I want to offer my congratulations to the team for an outstanding job. These types of games promote high utilization rates for our service providers allowing us to work together with them to achieve some of the lowest cost and best value services in the industry. These operational gains also shorten the time between capital being spent and the realization of production revenues, translating to better use of our capital and quicker returns at the bottom line. It simply allows us to do more, do it quicker and do it for less cost and will allow us to grow more efficiently in 2016 as these improvements continue.", "Late in the first quarter, we brought online a new Southwest Pennsylvania dry area pad with the first well going to sales at 31.3 million a day with a lateral length of 7,906 feet with 41 stages. We've been flowing this well now for 20 days at an average rate of 21.4 million a day. And there's still 2 more wells on the pad to be brought online in the second quarter.", "And just last week, we brought online a new well in our wet area with an 8,668 foot lateral completed with 45 stages. And it produced the sales for 24 hours at 43.4 million cubic feet equivalent per day. That's 19 million gas, 520 barrels of condensate and over 3,500 barrels of NGL. We believe this well has now set the record for the highest 24-hour production rate through sales in the entire Marcellus play.", "As a quick reminder, I want to make 3 important points. Number one, the production rates that we report, whether they're initial sales, 30-day averages or production reported over any length of time have been and will always be reported at actual conditions as constrained by the production facilities and the gathering system. Number two, the wells on the pad tend to come online at staggered times, very rarely are we able to bring more than 1 or 2 wells to sales off the same pad at the same time as we simply don't design a system to handle those high and short-term initial rates. What we've demonstrated over the years is this is the most cost-effective way to manage the compression and gathering system for the long term.", "And number three, while these are outstanding and record-setting initial sales rates, they are not appreciably different from what our team forecasted that these wells would produce. In other words, wells like these were built into our model and production forecast, and I believe our team is one of the best out there in understanding the rock and getting the most out of it. The initial sales rates only tell part of the story. What's really important is how these wells perform over time.", "Just about a year ago, we announced a record 5-well pad in our super-rich area that came online with a per well average of 28.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day or 4,773 Boe per day with 65% liquids. And they had an average lateral length of 6,635 feet and 34 stages. The record well in that pad that we announced a year ago and still the record liquids-rich well in the basin, meaning wells that have more than 60% liquids was $38.1 million a day from a 7,065 foot lateral with 36 stages.", "As of the end of March this year, that pad has produced 10.6 Bcf equivalent, which is 5.7 Bcf of gas, 223,000 barrels of condensate and 831,400 barrels of NGL. I believe if you look at that pad on an absolute or normalized basis, it's among the top performers in the region. Also, about 6 months ago, in the Southwest Pennsylvania dry area, we announced a pad with 3 wells that had an average -- 30-day average rate of $17.4 million a day per well, averaging 5,364 foot laterals in 28 stages. As of the end of March, those 3 wells have produced over 6.1 Bcf with the largest well at 2.6 Bcf. Again, in the dry gas area, we believe these wells are clearly among the top performers in Southwest Pennsylvania.", "In addition to the quality of the rock, we believe these examples of long-term performance also illustrate the diversity and highlight our ability to manage long-term sustainable growth at very attractive economics whether it's dry or liquids-rich gas.", "As Jeff referred to in his remarks, our first Utica well in Washington County, Pennsylvania, has now been online since late January, constrained at a designed maximum rate of $20 million a day and has produced 1.2 Bcf of gas thus far. Albeit early, the well is meeting all our original expectations. It's producing on an interruptible basis, meaning it's up and down and not at a constant rate. And before anyone asks, it's still too early to make an EUR prediction.", "The second well, which is an opposing lateral on the same pad, is being drilled and is still on target to be ready for sale this summer, which is about the same time that our permanent facilities will be ready. And the third well is still on schedule to be drilled later this year. Costs for the second well are still targeted to be approximately $13 million gross, which still includes some science [ph]. And as we get a few more wells under our belt, we believe those costs could come down another 15% to 25%. We expect that the Utica will be different from the early years of our Marcellus play and that it can be drilled on a true development mode right from the beginning. Most all our Utica wells are expected to be drilled on Marcellus pads making use of the existing infrastructure.", "Step-out wells won't be necessary, since we have deeper penetrations, lots of offset wells and 3D seismic over most of the area. Essentially, we can drill the wells like a very efficient manufacturing process. The Utica infrastructure will be easy, as it's dry gas. And we have existing right-of-ways in which we can lay additional pipes. Considering that early results indicate we have 400,000 net acres of core dry gas Utica potential under our Marcellus position in Southwest Pennsylvania, we believe this play gives us another attractive option for significant growth in value creation going forward. Our team is working on options to begin a Utica drilling program as early as next year if the market conditions support.", "Shifting to Northeast Pennsylvania, our team continues to lower cost and bring online really impressive wells. And we expect to continue the year with 1 to 2 drilling rigs. Of note, our most significant well in the quarter had an initial rate to sales of 26.1 million a day with a 30-day average rate of 21 million a day and a 60-day rate of 19 million a day. The well is completed with a 5,514 foot lateral and 28 stages for a total well cost of approximately $5 million. And we expect an EUR of over 3.3 Bcf per thousand foot of lateral. Following up on our top well in the same area that we announced about a year ago, the initial 30-day rate to sales on that well was 25.1 million a day, and it produced over 4 Bcf in 12 months. Again, in this area, we're also seeing significant operational gains, along with up to 25% lower cost. Like the super rich, wet, dry, Upper Devonian and Utica in Southwest Pennsylvania, this area offers yet another highly attractive area for long-term and sustainable growth.", "Like Jeff said in his remarks, 2015 is a challenging year for commodity prices, but I'm happy to report that Range is continuing to work safely, improve our operational efficiency, lower our cost structure, and at the same time, continue to improve our well performance.", "I also want to note that we have relayed to all of our employees that a tightened budget does not mean cutting corners. In fact, despite current market conditions, we've increased our focus on environmental compliance and safety. Safeguarding the environment and our employees, along with our contractors and the communities where we live and work, is a core philosophy at Range. When you think about the fact that we had our best operating efficiency gains today, combined with some of the best well results to date, this quarter again demonstrates our ability to grow value at the bottom line more and more efficiently. As I've often said, the rock rules. And we believe we've captured a large position with stack-pay potential and the best rock in the basin. Coupled with an experienced team, we've been able to achieve these results and have a consistent track record of growth with lower and lower cost. And we believe we're still in the early innings of the ballgame as we continue to drill longer laterals, implement improved completion designs and improve operational efficiencies. We still haven't drilled our best well yet. Now back to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Jeff, clearly, I'm going to take Ray at his word. I'm not going to ask about the EUR and Utica. However, as clearly, the results are pretty stunning obviously. So I guess I'm trying to understand is, things are pretty well set up. It looks like they really move very quickly on this program. What gives that basically makes space for -- in other words, how would you prioritize what you're seeing in the Utica versus, for example, equivalent opportunities in the Marcellus? And I've got a couple of follow-ups, please.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Okay. Yes, what our plan is to -- we've got the first well online, 12 weeks, you're right. So far we're very encouraged. Permanent facilities for that first well will be there about middle of the summer. We've spud our second well. And our plans are to put both wells online in the permanent facilities at summer, and then we'll spud a third well after that. Obviously, we're doing a lot of preplanning for a success case. How would we move the gas and also -- the key then will be as we get to the end of the year, and we have 3 wells, and we have longer production history, what do the economics and returns look like versus the Marcellus? You're correct, it could be a change in capital efficiency or another way for us to grow with better returns or better capital efficiency. To the extent it looks like that in the end of the year and it could be, then you'll see us work the Utica into our 2016, '17 programs and beyond.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I appreciate that. I guess it's kind of a related question then. So you've obviously now got a very large opportunity literally under your feet. So lack of any mention in this quarter of the Mississippian, and I guess it really raises the question of what do you consider a core or rather what do you consider non-core now? And I would ask specifically about Nora and the Mississippian in terms of -- whether they're going to be able to compete for capital. And I've got one final one, if I may?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, I mean it's a good point. I'll answer it in this way. If you look at Range historically since 2004 when we sold roughly $3 billion worth of assets, that's done several things for us. It's allowed us to continue to focus our capital into our highest return, best projects that keeps us focused. It's driven down our cost structure. It's driven up our returns. It's been a source of funds. So clearly, when we see that other people value those assets higher than we value them, we'll do the right -- what we think is the right thing for the shareholders. In the Mid-Continent area, we have roughly -- I don't remember exactly. I'm going to say 75 million per day and about 360,000 net acres. So we have a big footprint, lot of production, and we'll do what we think is the right thing there ultimately for shareholders. And then we have $170 million per day and 460,000 net acres, basically in the Southern Appalachian Division, basically in Virginia. So yes, we always look at those things, and we look at how -- what competes for capital and what's the best way to manage those assets going forward.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Is it an active process underway at this point, Jeff?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "We're always active. I mean we're always looking at the opportunities and considering how to best to maximize the value of the assets for the company.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. My final one hopefully is quick, so OpEx and CapEx cuts, the prospect of our gas price recovery. If you're growing at 20%, having already cut your capital $700 million, what do you do with incremental cash flow, whether it comes from CapEx adoptions or better gas prices? And I'll leave it there.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Yes, I think in the short term, if you're looking into 2015 to the extent we get service cost reductions or other things happen, I don't think -- we're not going to change our guidance for 2015. It's 20%, CapEx will be the same. To the extent we're more efficient, it might help us better set up 2016. Plus I think the other thing to remember that maybe helps to distinguish Range from its peers, we're one of, I think, several things, is our production profile is back-end loaded. And it's been that way every year for the last 5 years. So we see relatively little bit of growth in the second quarter, but the big growth in the third and fourth quarter. What that does and it's really helped set up 2016. And then with the portfolio we have, looking at 2016 and beyond, then it's a matter of -- we're in a fortunate position that we're in the core of the Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica. We have 900,000 acres of dry and 700,000 acres of wet. We can drill up and down that section and back and forth, so we'll be able -- we'll maximize returns as best we can going forward from there.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein.", "Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "You all replaced your debt-to-EBITDAX covenant with an EBITDAX to interest expense covenant. Can you talk about how easy or hard that discussion conversation was? And what the new covenant lets you do?", "Roger S. Manny", "Sure, Bob, it's Roger. It's a good question. It was actually a pretty easy conversation. As evident by the fact that all 29 banks unanimously approved the change. And on our part, a 51% vote, no bank chose to be carried. They all stepped up, doing the right thing. And we're very pleased and proud of them for doing that. So the reason is that the covenant really no longer fits. We redid our bank facility in the fourth quarter of last year. And in that process, we went to an annual Borrowing Base determination. A lot of folks really didn't pick up on that. But it was pretty big changes, saved us a lot of money. It helps us manage our affairs better over the long term. But when the banks do the Borrowing Base determination, they basically take all your cash flow until your next review date and toss it out. So in our case, when you went to a full 1 year redetermination, they took essentially over a year of our cash flow out through April of the next year, which encompasses a lot of our hedges and everything. So you can see, with the $3 billion-plus Borrowing Base that they approved, we're real pleased that, that ratified our liquidity and our position. The Borrowing Base is -- because that's their primary tool to manage leverage. And the reason is pretty simple, it's a forward-looking test. It's basically a PV-9 coverage test. So the best way to work your growth is to be looking out the windshield and working the brake and throttle accordingly. And that's why the banks rely on that test first and foremost. The debt-to-EBITDAX covenant, that's a rearview mirror test. So it's really not as applicable to managing leverage over time. So in our case, the covenant was kind of a no-harm-no-foul covenant. We're never anywhere close to that ratio, never intended to be anywhere close to that ratio. But looking at it after getting through the restructuring process, we just decided that an interest coverage test was more appropriate. We rely on the annual Borrowing Base determination to work with our banks to keep leverage where it needs to be. And that rearview mirror test just didn't make sense for us anymore. And the banks agreed with us, and we made the swap. And it just removes a source of potential concern from investors that may not have an in-depth knowledge of the process.", "Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "That's great color. Quick follow-up, you talked about your rig contract roll-off in the strategy there. Can you talk about your completions contract and the strategy for keeping them busy? Do those contracts roll? Or are they longer term?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, Bob, this is Ray. We really don't have any long-term frac contracts. We have what we more commonly refer to inside the company as relationships. We've had, for instance, frac-ed the majority of our completion work in Southwest PA, really for almost -- since 2007. So that long-term relationship allows us to work with them on key performance indicators that help us work more efficiently, and then we're able to arrive at pricing, kind of based on the market and utilization that allows us to do things that a lot of our competitors can't do. And that consistent strategy over the years has allowed us to innovate with a lot of things like new manifolds that our teams designed and new liner systems to protect the pads. And all those sort of things that have allowed us to go forward. So we don't really technically have any long-term frac contracts. And that was one of the things that allowed us, like on the drilling rig side, to take advantage of what we were seeing happening back in December and January, work with our supply-side vendors and suppliers to create prices where they could still work and we could still continue on with some pretty significant savings. And I think that was way in advance of what a lot of our competitors were able to do.", "Operator", "The next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Your lateral length in the 2 Southwest Pennsylvania, Marcellus that you highlighted today was in the 8,000 to 9,000-foot range, which is well above your average. Could you just update us on how significant your ability to drill wells of this lateral length in your southwest dry and wet gas acreage is from a contiguous perspective? Whether you see these type of results as repeatable? And maybe I'll ask an EUR question on this, what the impact on EUR and well cost per thousand feet of lateral is versus your base case Slide 17 assumptions?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, Brian, good questions. We have only -- like Jeff said in his opening remarks, we've only touched a small, small number of the total potential locations that we've got left to drill. We don't have -- while we do have a lot of units formed, we don't really have a lot of limits on the lateral length that we can do going forward. So we do expect to continue to significantly increase lateral lengths by year going forward. And I think eventually, you'll see our average up there in the 8,000 to 9,000-foot range. And of course, every area will have a different optimal at-lateral length depending on liquids and as [ph] well pressures and all the different things. Because remember, we have a huge position there in Southwest Pennsylvania. So the Marcellus is not the Marcellus -- it's not the same all across that property. We have super rich, wet, dry. We have thicker areas, higher-pressure areas, a little bit deeper areas. So all of those wells will be designed differently. But we do expect to get significantly longer each year. Those wells, longer wells that we talked about in the remarks today, they were in the plan. That's part of what makes our average go longer this year. And our team is continually able to push those wells out. We have, in fact, to drill the wells that are much longer than those. So technically, mechanically, from a land standpoint, there's really no limits to what we can do. What I would like to point out is, look at some of those wells, for instance, in that 8,000 to 9000-foot range and compare them to some of the offsets in the plank areas that aren't as good a rock. And I think you'll start to see what we get excited about talking about the longer laterals and how much more capital efficiency the well improvements we're going to see going forward. From your standpoint of...", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And totally to clarify that, I know what Ray means. When he's saying plank areas, he's saying our acreage is core. You can look at other operators who have drilled outside of what we feel are core areas who have already drilled longer laterals like that and then compare them on a rate basis or EUR per thousand foot or per stage. But sorry to interrupt, Ray. For listeners, I want to make sure that was crystal clear.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, good to point out. And then your point on cost -- well cost. I mean, again those were also forecasted into our model and our plan this year. But if you'll look on Page 8 in our presentation for 2015 in Southwest PA, we give you a cost per foot for those wells. That's for the average well that will turn to sales this year. And if you were to think about it from a standpoint, longer is certainly better because economies of scale kick in and so forth, so longer laterals do get cheaper on a per foot basis. And we have seen well performance hold rock steady. And in fact, I think these 2 wells will probably end up having some of the highest performance on a per thousand foot basis of any of the wells in the area. So we do see good improvements going forward. And the third point I want to make is we really did forecast -- our team is getting really good at understanding this rock. And I think our track record supports that. But they were forecasting rates pretty close to these in our model. So that's part of what was a significant point in allowing us to reach 20% growth this year to $700 million less capital. That's what we've been saying for many years is our capital efficiency is going to flow through as we drill longer laterals, and our team gets better at getting more out of the rock. And like I've said, you probably get sick of me saying it, but I'm going to keep saying it, the rock rules. And we think we've got a core position where all of this is possible. And we're in the very early innings of the ballgame, because we've got thousands and thousands of more of these wells that we can do as we get better and better.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And I'd just add again a little bit to what Ray said. I totally agree with what he's saying, the rock rules. But you want to have the high-quality rock in the core in an area of good infrastructure with favorable takeaway and contracts to external markets. And I'm sure Chad, at some point, will hit on some of those.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. My follow-up is that you highlighted in your opening comments the unique attractiveness of your NGL's contracts. Beyond the startup of ethane exports later this year, can you talk to what you see as differentiating your ethane and propane FX versus others? And whether you see a situation in the market whether to maintain pipeline stacked portions of your ethane, or propane production would at least temporarily be a drag to cash flow?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "Let me -- I'd like Chad to answer that question. But, Chad, if you would, could you also talk about some of the gas contracts for second half of the year? Because it's all, really all 3 products, natural gas and NGLs and condensate.", "Chad L. Stephens", "Yes, this is Chad, Brian. As Jeff mentioned in his notes earlier in the call, 80% of our ethane is tied to either oil or gas index. So that's already reflected in the prices we show in our financials. Once Mariner East starts up, 20,000 additional barrels of ethane will be going to market, so it can go into international markets priced at a common Naphtha Brent crude sliding scale formula, which will again improve our cash flow. We focus more on improving our cash flow than we do our per unit metrics. So that's an important point we try to make in our slides on 37, 38 and 39 in our slide deck. Once Mariner East is in service and flowing in later this year, we, going forward, our LRP forecast, we don't need any more ethane projects to meet spec. We can grow our production under the LRP up to as much as 3 Bcf a day. So we don't need any more projects. Mariner East will also help in propane service because we can float 20,000 barrels a day and load ships at a very high rate once that's in service. Jeff referenced our gas contracts. As reflected in our slide deck, we show what our firm transport capacity projects are. And later this year, we have our specter Uniontown to Gas City project coming online, which takes 200,000 a day of firm capacity over to the Midwest, where we get much better pricing. It's -- the indexes over there are very stable. And then later in 2016 and 2017, we have other firm transport capacity projects coming online, which again will take our gas away from the Appalachian basin to more stable of indexes and help improve our cash flow.", "Operator", "The next question is from Dave Kistler of Simmons & Company.", "David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Real quickly, looking at the CapEx this quarter, it's down 45% quarter-over-quarter and keeping your full year CapEx guidance, which would imply that it continues to step down similar to kind of what you outlined with rigs falling off contract, et cetera. Can you break down for us how that CapEx declined both this quarter and going forward? It's split between lower activity, lower service cost and better efficiency gain.", "Roger S. Manny", "Dave, this is Roger. Let me answer the first half of your question. I'll switch it over to Ray to talk more about where the capital is going later in the year. Just one thing I wanted to highlight, there was a big working capital swing in the first quarter. So over $100 million of the incremental debt and spending was due to working capital. So there's a delta between the cost and current schedule and the cash flow. So please go through the queue or give our guys a call. They can walk you through that. So the CapEx increase, depending on how you measure it, is not as large as it first may appear, but I'll let Ray tell you where -- exactly where the money is going.", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, we -- Dave, when we put together the CapEx plan for '15, we did plan in there some service cost reductions. And I talked a lot about that on the first call that if you looked at a well in Southwest Pennsylvania, the lion's share of our CapEx is gone. And if you looked at a well in February compared to December, on apples-to-apples basis, we're seeing 23% to 25% less total well cost as a result of service cost reductions. Those numbers were built into our plan this year, but it's also important to realize that all those savings didn't kick in on January 1. They really kick in towards the end of the first quarter, and then they start flowing through the rest of the year. So I think you'll see the CapEx will come down quarter-over-quarter because we tend to -- we have more rigs running at the first part of the year than we will at the last part of the year. And that's pretty, pretty much the same that it's been every year. So I don't see that as a whole lot different, but hopefully, that's a little more color on how that comes together.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "And then to just reemphasize, we still feel comfortable and are confident with the 20% growth at $870 million.", "David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Great, I appreciate that clarification. And then maybe switching a little bit to some of your slides where I know you put some of this out last quarter as well, but you highlighted the benefit of the optimized completions and the down-spacing in the Marcellus and then in the optimized completions in the Nora area. And obviously, nice step uplift in production associated with those. Does that maybe argue for going back to existing wells and doing optimized completions or refrac on those existing wells, just given that they'd be even lower cost and probably generate with 50% uplift of production versus what you've done before, maybe even a better rate of return than drilling original wells?", "Ray N. Walker", "Yes, Dave, I mean we did talk about that example that we put in there last conference call on Page 36. And that was an exact case that you just described where we went into a well, a pad that had 5 wells on it that were 2 years old, had been online for 2 years and we put 2 new wells sort of in between the laterals. And there were really 3 things we wanted to test. We wanted to test how much less would the wells cost, drilling them on since all the existing infrastructure roads, pads, water, gathering system and all that sort of thing was already there. Number two, did the new wells interfere with the older wells? And then number three, how much better would the new wells be with the new completion -- newer completion technology. And number one, the wells were $850,000 a piece cheaper. And we think that number could even be higher as we begin to do more of this as we go forward. Number two, there was no impact to the older wells, which I think is very significant. And I think you've read a lot about our competitors that are in noncore areas. They have not been able to do that, where they've seen big hits on their offsetting wells. And then third thing, the wells produced 53% more production than the first year as compared to the older wells that had -- I think early on, the eyepiece were 4x higher. So clearly, we see that as unbelievable upside going forward, because we clearly have a lot of those pads already out there, some of them as much as 8 or 9, 10 years old on those. So I think that going forward, you're going to see us probably in about 2017, '18 as we get into our further plans down the road where a bigger and bigger percentage of our wells each year will be going back on to those existing pads. We see that as a huge step change in both well cost, efficiencies and well performance and then in -- also in gathering system cost. Because your gathering system's already there, already been mostly paid for. So essentially, those wells will produce at a much lower gathering fee. So we see that as big potential going forward. There's not really any of those wells planned at this year as we're still trying to really optimize our program to try to get the wells, the final HBP work done that we need to get done, the infrastructure buildouts that we're still doing over this year and next year. And I think that, that is big potential that we see going forward.", "David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Okay, appreciate that. But maybe one just clarification. Other than drilling in kind of a tighter spacing, would you look at going back to an existing well and refrac-ing it. We're hearing about recompletions from other folks that are seeing that as a positive, and obviously, from some of the service companies commenting on that. How do you guys think about that in your inventory? Or is it really, hey, we're going to finish HBP and then we'll consider those things?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, our teams, I think it's probably technically one of the most gifted teams in the industry. And they are continually coming up with innovations and new ideas and concepts and sort of things. We have studied and talked about refracs for some time. I personally have a lot of experience with refracs, most of which was not that good. So we don't really see refracs as big potential going forward. It's certainly not anything we're counting on. But we will clearly study it as we go forward. And my overall statement for refracs, if you really mess something up the first time, then there's potential that you could do something if you went back in there. But we don't see that as big potential and it's not certainly -- not anything that we're counting on going forward.", "Operator", "The next question is from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just a kind of follow-up on the Slide 36, that somebody was asking about the down-spacing, guys. Just a question now, is -- have you kind of looked at that as far as in the entire Southern Marcellus and the Northern Marcellus area? And are you confident now that, that's working -- going to work in most of the area? Or is that still isolated to kind of core areas of each of those respective regions?", "Alan W. Farquharson", "Neal, this is Alan Farquharson. I think that what we've seen so far is we've done a fair amount in -- we've done a fair amount of activity in the wet and super rich area. Our plans are to do some -- a little more testing in the dry. We're also looking at what some of our competitors have done as well. Obviously, we don't have to spend all the R&D work, but we believe fairly comfortable that you'll be seeing a significantly tighter spacing in the wet and super rich. We also believe, but we don't have yet the data to kind of really feel comfortable yet that we'll probably see some of that happen in the dry areas as well. And we think some of it has to do with just the quality of the rock that we have at the end of the day compared to what our other competitors have.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Yes, got it. And then obviously you've had 2 monster wells within the Southern Marcellus between this recent Washington County well, the 43.4 million a day test rate, and then obviously, on the heels of this one in December. I guess a couple of questions around that. First, on that, I noticed I think both -- or you mentioned I think in here that your Utica's flowing around 20 million a day. Could you just talk about how you see -- I mean given these monster test rates that you have, how you guys sort of think about the sales or the choke program that you have that once you see these huge test rates?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, that's a good question Neal. And one thing I want to correct you on, those aren't just monster wells, they're monster pads. Because they both are multi-well pads, and we just simply hadn't been able to turn the other wells on yet. But we expect actually pretty similar results from other wells on the pad. Part of our long-term goal that the team works on, sometimes 3, 5 and 7 years in advance, is looking at the gathering system. And we have very intricate models of the gathering system. We're working with MarkWest on deliverability at any given point, compressor stations, upgrades, process and plant and so forth. So all of this has been built into that plan. And we don't have a choke management program as a gimmick or a fad or anything like that to manage the wells. We're simply trying to produce those wells of what we believe is the optimum performance that will generate the best economics for the project at the end of the day. It's a long-term look that we take at it. Initial production rates are great. They're fun to talk about. It's kind of a yardstick to compare wells. And these -- in a case like these 2 monster pads, you had a lot of facilities there for maybe 3 wells or 5 wells, depending on how many wells were on each pad. And what you end up doing is bring one well on and just let it produce through the facilities that all 5 wells might use to see what it's capable of. In actuality, we'll probably choke that well back and then start opening up the other wells and try to get them online. They'll all be produced or constrained conditions for quite a while in that case. But that's the way we designed it going forward. And we think that keeps our cost structure down. It's better planning with MarkWest, which allows them to keep their cost structure down, which in turn gets us lower gathering fees. And again, we're really focused on the years ahead and watching that gathering fee fall off as we go back in and fill in on these areas. We think that's the most efficient way to develop this project long term. Because again, we've only touched a very small portion of the total number of locations that we can drill going forward just in the Marcellus. On the Utica and places like that, the other stack-pay potential, we've got a long ways to go on that also. As for as the Utica well, when we get the permanent facilities online in the middle of the summer, those wells will be put online, and they will be uninterruptible. In other words, we'll be able to hold them at a constant rate. And these production facilities are designed to limit those wells at 20 million a day. And again, that's not necessarily for any sort of choke management or anything that we're worried about on that end of it as much as it is trying to optimize the cost for those facilities in that gathering system that we're putting in play.", "Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Ray, if I can have just one last one. Just again, I know it's not just Washington County, obviously, that's where these huge pads where for this Marcellus and Utica, but kind of in this surrounding area. Near term, do you have -- I guess when you have the takeaway for each of the -- all this Utica production on top of the existing Marcellus production you have there, what do you have sort of near term, I guess? I mean could you flow it, I guess, in the same line? I guess you could, but you really don't want to, maybe you can just, maybe talk about takeaway if you would start with kind of Washington County, that generally, given these huge pads, takeaway for both the Utica, Marcellus in this specific area?", "Ray N. Walker", "Well, I'll start and let Chad jump in. But again, like Jeff brought up earlier, there's really 3 keys to a big successful play like this. One is, you got to have the rock, and we've clearly done that. Number two, you've got to have the infrastructure. And we request that 75 years plus of infrastructure was built right through this area. And we were able to tap into all of that. We were first movers in the play. And working with MarkWest, we've been able to put a huge system of interleaks and placed there for the wet gas. I think what a lot of people forget is there's clearly also a lot of dry gas lines in that system as there's a lot of residue gas that comes off the plant, a lot of meter taps into the different pipelines, Tennessee and Columbia and Line N [ph] and so forth. So we have all of that together growing over time. And then the third piece, the third cornerstone of it is the market and having actual customers on the other end to use the product. And that's also been a core philosophy of ours for years is to cultivate, not only the firm transportation and the actual infrastructure to get there, but also the consumers on the other end to use that. So in part of our plan that the team is currently working on today, to put an effective Utica development program together, which could begin as early as next year depending on market conditions. All 3 of those pieces have to be in place, and I'll let Chad refer to how we might expand going forward.", "Chad L. Stephens", "Yes, so to expand on that a little bit, because of all the existing infrastructure, we are currently working on a short-term solution to be in service, be it the late 2016 for what we're calling a header system, which is some pipe that would run through this particular area of Utica development to get the gas to our existing capacity that we have to take it to market. And then long term, that header system, we're going to be able to expand it to whatever direction the Utica and dry gas development takes us. So having the existing infrastructure allows the optionality to be able to quickly as we -- as the drilling teams come up with these new monster pads as you described them, we have the opportunity to build out the infrastructure, and we'll do so. So we have short-term projects that we're working on for mid 2016 and much bigger projects beyond that in later years to help get the gas out of there -- at good economics, at good prices.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura", "2015 is a challenging year for our industry. With our current plan to spend approximately $700 million less in 2015 and 2014 and still target 20% growth, we believe that we'll be one of the most capital-efficient companies in our industry. These capital efficiencies coupled with our large footprint in the core of the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian and the optionality of being able to drill dry, wet and super-rich acreage, as well as the shape of our 20% growth profile for 2015, which is back-end loaded, have us well-positioned for 2015, '16 and beyond. Thanks for participating on the call. If you have additional questions, please follow-up with our IR team.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Welcome to the Range Resources Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risk and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers' remark, there will be a question-and-answer period.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney L. Waller - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome. Range reported results for second quarter 2015 with record production, a continuing decrease in unit costs, and some outstanding well results. The order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, Chairman, President and CEO; Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ray Walker, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer.", "Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on our website under the Investor tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we've posted to our website supplemental tables which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins, and the reconciliation of reported earnings to our adjusted non-GAAP earnings that are discussed on the call.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Rodney. The past several months have been a challenge. Appalachian natural gas differentials have widened as the basin awaits takeaway expansions and a more balanced regional supply and demand picture.", "In addition, NGL netbacks have been weak in Appalachia, particularly propane, as regional supply has outstripped summer demand. In the face of these current pricing issues, we remain focused on things that will improve our netbacks in the near term and things that will make Range successful in the long run.", "We're focused on executing our plan and driving down costs in the field and at the corporate level while operating safely. The good news is that we put some arrangements in place years ago that will come to fruition later this year, which should make some of this pricing pain short lived for Range.", "For the second half of 2015, there are two projects that will benefit Range, specifically. The first is Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City project. Range is an anchor shipper on this project and has approximately 200 million cubic feet per day of capacity. The first leg of the project is anticipated to commence on August 1, and the second and final leg is projected to start up on September 1. This will move about 200 million cubic feet per day gross or about 170 million cubic feet per day net of our production from the local Appalachian M2 markets to premium Midwest markets.", "Under current strip pricing, this should increase our realized price by approximately $1.00 on this production. For the next 12 months, we've locked in a significant portion of the price uplift by hedging the basis. The uplift from this project is expected to have a significant impact on our Southwest Marcellus realized pricing for future periods. The 170 million cubic feet per day net capacity would equate to 28% of our average Southwest Marcellus gas production in the second quarter.", "The second project, which we expect to be very impactful for us, is Mariner East I. Range has 40,000 barrels per day of capacity on Mariner East I and is the anchor shipper on this project as well. The capacity is for 20,000 barrels of ethane and 20,000 barrels per day of propane. We'll also have access to 80% of a 1 million barrel propane storage cavern at Marcus Hook.", "Sunoco is projecting Mariner East I to start up in late September with commissioning completed a few weeks thereafter. Mariner East I will lock in our Appalachian propane transport costs and result in significant transportation savings. It will also enable us to choose between Northeast markets and international markets, depending on demand and pricing. When Mariner East I is fully up and running, this project, in combination with Mariner West and ATEX, is anticipated to result in about a $90 million increase to our net cash flow on an annualized basis without counting the potential propane price uplift opportunities.", "The marketing team has not only put in place good projects for the second half of 2015, but also, looking forward into 2016 and 2017, there are other projects that should benefit Range. Range is an anchor shipper and has 150 million cubic feet per day gross of capacity on Spectra's Gulf Markets Expansion Project. Start-up is targeted for the fourth quarter of 2016 and this will move 128 million cubic feet per day net of Range's gas to the Gulf Coast.", "Rover Phase I is also planned to start up in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, at the end of 2017, Range has participated in several pipeline expansion projects that will allow Range to move an additional 900 million cubic feet per day of Range's gas to the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Canadian markets.", "On a macro basis, good things are happening inside the Appalachian Basin. The overall rig count for the Marcellus is down 55% from its peak. Total Marcellus production has been flat to declining since the beginning of the year based on pipeline flows. The Utica rig count has dropped 66% from its peak. In addition to dropping rigs, the remaining rigs are moving out of the wet gas and liquids-rich portion of the Utica, which should help rebalance the oversupply of liquids in the basin. Given the steep declines of most of these Utica liquids wells, the rebalance should happen sooner rather than later. With the drop in Utica rig count by two-thirds, coupled with the lack of hedges for 2016 and beyond by most companies, and with lower strip pricing for 2016, the Utica rig count will probably stay low for a while, which will help on the supply side.", "Good things are also happening outside of the Appalachian Basin. Looking across the U.S., the oil rig count is down about 60%. There's a lot of associated natural gas with oil, and the associated gas now accounts for a significant portion of total U.S. gas production. Per flow data, it appears that the gas from some of the key oil basins may have peaked in April. Since the associated gas is very rich, about 40% of all NGLs come from this source. Therefore, the NGLs from this source should follow the trend in associated gas.", "On the demand side, LNG gas exports from the U.S. are still on target to begin in the fourth quarter of this year and ramp with time. Natural gas continues to take market share from coal, and I believe that this trend will continue, given that natural gas is a much friendlier fuel from an environmental perspective than coal. In addition, natural gas exports to Mexico, industrial demand for gas and natural gas for transportation, directly as CNG or indirectly as electricity, are projected to grow with time.", "We believe these supply and demand side forces are working together to rebalance the market sooner than it was currently priced into the strip. Consequently, we believe that as supply and demand equalize, that natural gas will move up. Equally important, as the infrastructure within the Appalachian Basin builds out, the basis should narrow with time. In combination, this should result in better netbacks for Range.", "In a commodity business, it's important to be low cost and have scale. On slide four of our IR presentation, we've included a new slide from Wood Mackenzie. According to their work on the Marcellus, Range not only has the largest resource base, we have the lowest breakeven cost. In addition, we have the upside of potentially 400,000 net acres of dry Utica gas beneath our Marcellus acreage.", "Coupling this resource base with our capital discipline and diversified portfolio of marketing arrangements, which gives us multiple options that our competitors do not have, Range is positioned to create value as we move forward into an expected better market that balances supply, demand and infrastructure.", "I'll now turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Jeff. The second quarter traditionally brings the mildest weather of the year, which tends to amplify the pricing impact of a supply surplus. This year's mild second quarter occurred against the unusual backdrop of seasonal market surpluses for all of our energy commodities: oil, natural gas and NGLs. Fortunately, as Jeff discussed, better days are ahead; and in the meantime, our results are supported by significant cost reductions and a strong hedge position.", "Quarterly financial performance since 2008 has been a tug-of-war between low-cost production growth and realized price. With the help of consistent and significant unit cost reductions during this timeframe, more often than not at Range, growth at low cost has won the contest. Production growth of 24% and 11% lower unit costs in the second quarter, however were no match for a 38% year-over-year reduction in realized price. Despite significantly higher production, revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales, including cash-settled derivatives, was $383 million, 15% below last year.", "Second quarter cash flow was $161 million and EBITDAX for the quarter came in at $203 million. Cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.97. Year-to-date second quarter cash flow totaled $367 million, while year-to-date EBITDAX was $446 million.", "GAAP net income for the second quarter was a loss of $119 million. Non-GAAP earnings, calculated using popular analyst methodology, was $2.3 million or $0.01 per fully diluted share.", "The second quarter was another good one on the expense reduction side, with direct operating, production, taxes, exploration, G&A and interest expense totals all coming in below last year on both a unit cost basis and absolute dollar basis.", "The only expense item to slightly exceed quarterly guidance was interest expense, as the second quarter included one month of negative interest carry from our issuance of $750 million in 4.875% 10-year senior notes. We issued these notes in favorable market conditions several months ago, well before next month's redemption of our callable 6.75% notes.", "Second quarter cash unit costs were reduced by $0.25 per mcfe and total unit costs were reduced by $0.36 per mcfe from last year. At current realized prices, these are very meaningful reductions. We believe additional unit cost reductions are possible as we become even more efficient with both our operating and capital expenditures. Third quarter specific line item expense guidance may be found in our second quarter earnings press release.", "The big news over on the balance sheet was the $750 million issuance of 10-year senior notes. At May issuance, the 4.875% notes represented the lowest yield of any non-investment grade energy and power sector issuer of any maturity in 2015. Many thanks to the institutions on this call who helped make this possible as the transaction demonstrates the credit worthiness of our company and the quality of our long life, low-cost, high-return assets.", "Lower prices and the front-end loaded nature of our capital budget in 2015 pushed our leverage a bit higher in the second quarter with second quarter trailing 12-month debt-to-EBITDAX ratio coming in at 3.3 times. I should mention that this leverage ratio is charted territory for Range, as we have been over 3 times on several occasions over the years. Even though we no longer have a debt-to-EBITDAX loan covenant and our next annual borrowing base determination isn't until May of next year, our stance on leverage has not changed. When leverage exceeds 3 times, we will begin working on ways to bring it down. It would be premature to discuss the specific things we are working on right now, but as Range has sold over $3 billion in assets over the past 10 years, this is the first option we consider to reduce leverage.", "Range added new hedges for 2015 and 2016 across all commodities during the second quarter, the details of which may be found in the earnings press release and Range website.", "As Jeff mentioned, the second quarter was a challenging one. However, Range is structured operationally and financially to handle this kind of adversity. Our low-cost structure, high-return projects, long life assets, strong balance sheet, plentiful liquidity and consistent performance history provide welcome stability and the means to navigate through these tough times. Until times are better, we will continue to drive down costs, high grade our portfolio, and prudently allocate capital.", "Ray, over to you.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Roger. During times like these, it's critical to have a great team, quality assets, size and scale, a strong balance sheet and a low cost structure. Range has all of that, but we also have the unique ability to drill in high-quality core areas of dry, wet or super-rich with the operational flexibility to reallocate capital when needed and maintain capital discipline.", "During the first half of this year, we've clearly exercised those abilities and changed the lay of the land. And I'll walk you through some of those changes now. Of course, the first step happened at the beginning of the year when we adjusted our 2015 plan by cutting CapEx by 45%, or $700 million less as compared to last year, while still delivering 20% production growth. And we're still on track to execute that plan. Another step we took was to allocate more of our capital to dry gas drilling in Southwest PA due to the challenges we saw coming in the NGL market. The dry gas economics were substantially better.", "In Southwest PA, our normal year-end inventory of wells ready for completion would normally be in the range of 20 to 30 wells. Our current forecast is that we should have between 50 and 60 wells in inventory, and about half of those wells are expected to be in the dry gas area. Of course, it's very preliminary and those numbers will likely change, but those wells can be brought online in 2016 with less capital since we're only looking at the completion cost rather than the total well cost.", "In addition, we've increased the number of wells being turned to sales in 2015 as we now expect an additional 16 Marcellus wells to be turned in line at the very end of 2015 rather than early next year; all of this allowing us to start 2016 with good momentum into the historically better winter pricing environment.", "With our new contracts and low-cost transportation, we will be positioned well to start off next year while maintaining good capital discipline. Our capital spending was front-end loaded this year with us spending approximately two-thirds of our capital budget during the first two quarters. In January, we had 15 rigs running. Currently, we have 10 rigs running and we expect to average seven rigs in the third quarter, going down to six in the fourth quarter. We'll also be tapering off frac crews in the second half of this year. So, as you can see, our CapEx spend will be substantially less during the second half of the year, and I want to reiterate that we remain committed to meet our planned $870 million budget.", "We beat production guidance for the second quarter and came in at 1.373 Bcf equivalent per day, largely driven by better-than-expected performance in the dry gas area of Southwest Pennsylvania. For the third quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.39 Bcf equivalent per day to 1.4 Bcf equivalent per day with approximately 28% liquids, and are still on track to deliver 20% production growth for the year.", "The Mariner East I project has been delayed from the original expectation of a July start-up, and we forecasted the project coming online late in the quarter with full operations during the fourth quarter. Like Roger pointed out in his remarks, our costs are consistently improving on both an absolute and unit basis. Corporate LOE per mcfe is down 20% for the quarter as compared to last year, and G&A per mcfe is down 21%.", "We've demonstrated discipline and a continued focus on costs. Reacting to the current environment, we had to make some tough decisions in closing our Oklahoma City division office and making substantial personnel cuts in our legacy fields in Pennsylvania. Those decisions resulted in layoffs of approximately 11% of our workforce. Those decisions were not made lightly, but in this environment, tough decisions like these become necessary.", "We've updated our Marcellus economics on page 16 in our presentation to reflect the current pricing and differentials. We left the well cost and type curves unchanged in order to get an apples-to-apples comparison. As you can see, our economics are still good in all cases, but the dry area economics have improved, supporting our decision to direct more of our capital towards dry gas in Southwest PA. The improved economics in the dry area are driven primarily by the improvement in basis differentials coupled with our transportation contracts going forward.", "In the Marcellus, we continue to upgrade our completion designs by optimizing proppant loading, sizes and concentrations along with reduced stage spacing across our very large and diverse acreage position in Southwest PA. For example, stage sizes today range from 200,000 pounds of proppant per stage up to 500,000 pounds per stage, depending on the area and the particular reservoir characteristics in that area.", "Well performance this year is on target, and I'll point out a couple of examples of recent performance. In the wet area, we brought online a five-well pad averaging 28.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well initial rate to sales with a seven-day average rate to sales of 20.8 million a day per well under constrained conditions. Those wells averaged 5,204-foot laterals with 27 stages per well.", "In the dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, we had a two-well pad come online with an average initial rate to sales of 34.2 million cubic feet a day per well under constrained conditions. The average 90-day rate is 20 million cubic feet a day per well. Those wells average 9,074-foot laterals with 45 stages, and have cum'd over 1.8 Bcf each well in 90 days.", "Expanding on that area where these two wells are located, we have a total of six offset wells with up to a year of production history. The average cum'd production at 90 days to sales under facility and gathering system constraints was 1.5 Bcf per each well. These were shorter laterals averaging 5,064 feet with 26 stages. Our EUR in this area is currently 3 Bcf per thousand foot, with some of the older wells over 3.2 Bcf per thousand foot, putting this area on par with some of the best production in the basin.", "We believe our dry gas area in Southwest PA will be very prolific and it's clearly exceeding our expectations thus far this year. In Southwest Pennsylvania, we completed 52% more stages in the first half of this year as compared to last year.", "Our stage count per day improved by 20% for the first quarter and by 30% for the first half of the year. Highlighting the second quarter, we averaged 6.3 stages a day per frac crew, which we believe is the best in the basin. As we've front-end loaded a lot of the activity this year, our total stages and stage counts per day are expected to be less during the last half of this year.", "On the drilling side, during the second quarter we saw a 13% decrease in days while drilling 21% longer laterals as compared to last year. To put that in perspective, based on recent data, we would estimate drilling an 8,500-foot lateral well in less than 18 days. These efficiencies have been critical in helping us deliver 20% growth this year with 45% less capital, and we're far from done as these improvements will keep on coming.", "Other than having a great operating team, a critical factor in achieving these operational and well performance gains is being in the core of the play. As I've often said, the rock rules. We list the normalized EUR and cost results of our Marcellus areas in a table in our earnings release.", "Achieving results comparable to these are very difficult when you're not in the core. When you combine these results with our lower transportation costs and all the great work our team has done at securing better markets, it drives what we believe to be one of the best capital efficiencies in the industry.", "Operational gains, coupled with further service cost reductions, have helped to reduce our overall well costs significantly. When comparing the first half of 2015 with the second half of 2014, we're seeing total well cost reductions on an apples-to-apples basis of up to 25% or more, and we're continuing to see costs come down on things like steel, along with other goods and prices \u2013 services.", "Like I said on the last call, Range did not have any long-term drilling or service contracts and, therefore, our operating teams had, and still have, a tremendous competitive advantage in optimizing our service provider relationships. Coupled with our operating practices, we can achieve attractive pricing while our service providers maintain high utilization rates and reasonable margins.", "Over the long term, we expect that this will differentiate Range versus our peers as we believe our well planned, disciplined and growing operations have allowed us to attract some of the most favorable service pricing in the basin.", "Our Washington County, PA Utica well is still producing into our wet system on an interruptible and constrained basis, and it's still too early to make any reasonable estimates of ultimate performance. We're finishing up the completion on our second well and expect that both wells will be online in the permanent new dry gas infrastructure over the next couple of months.", "You can see some of the details on that second well in our earnings release. I expect that we'll be able to give more information on well performance after both wells have been online consistently for a few months, and we still expect to spud our third well before year end and it will be completed in 2016.", "Our Fort Worth operations team, which now also runs our Midcontinent division in addition to our Northern Marcellus division, is doing a great job focusing on cost while delivering great well results. In Northeast PA, we just drilled and set pipe on a well for $284 per lateral foot as compared to $394 per foot estimated for 2015. That's a 28% reduction in cost from what we originally planned.", "Since that team has taken over the Midcontinent assets in a very short time and with just a few wells under their belt, they've reduced the total completed well cost in the Nemaha Chat play by over 31% to approximately $2.2 million per well with the last few wells. And the initial production from those wells is consistent with our expectations.", "Our Southern Appalachia Nora team is also doing great, and while they have a very limited capital budget this year, they're continuing to bring online some of the best coal bed methane wells we've seen in 25 years. Utilizing the new high rate frac technique, the recent CBM wells are 60% better than their average offsets with significantly better economics.", "Although Range's operational tempo has been high, employee safety remains a top priority. Employee and management commitment to safety has resulted in Range having no OSHA recordable injuries thus far in 2015 and zero hours of lost time in the last 18 months. We are really proud of all of our operating teams for working safely and being good stewards in the communities where we live and work.", "Like I said in the beginning, times are indeed tough and every penny really counts. Maintaining capital discipline and a low-cost structure are extremely important. I'm proud to say that we believe we have a deeper, more diverse and better inventory than anyone in the basin with minimal type curve risk at one of the lowest cost structures, with one of the best capital efficiencies, great capital discipline, and one of the best teams in the industry.", "Now, back to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Ventura. The question-and-answer session will now begin. Our first question comes from Ron Mills with Johnson & Rice. Please proceed with your question.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "I know it's still early, but do you have any preliminary thoughts on 2016, in particular, in light of your 3 times leverage ratio, how CapEx versus growth can look at either varying levels of CapEx, depending on how the cash flows look like they'll settle out?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, that's a great question. And I'll start by saying it is early. Typically, we work that really hard, present it to our board in December, and then after their approval announce it in January. But let me give you a lot of thoughts around it that, hopefully, will put some sideboards around it and give you a lot of color.", "I'd like to start by talking about this year, 2015. In this year, we're getting a 20% growth with $870 million of CapEx. And we feel good about those numbers, and that's where we'll end up. And if you look at that, I think, versus any of our peers, I think we're at the head of the class. Our dollars go further than almost any operator. We're, I believe, one of the most, if not the most, capital efficient company out there. So, we'll start with 2015.", "If you look into 2016, I think our pricing gets better. The netbacks will get better. One, we'll have a full year of Mariner East in 2016 and we're \u2013 again, have the lion's share of Mariner East. We're the only producer that has capacity on it. We have 40,000 barrels per day on it. So, our netback pricing for our NGLs should get significantly better for ethane, for propane, et cetera.", "Also, we'll have a full year at Uniontown to Gas City, which is a big uplift and one that's a really significant portion of our production in the Southwest. It's initially $1.00 uplift in that $0.75 to $1.00 range, and we've hedged and locked a lot of that in. So, our netbacks should get significantly better in 2016.", "And, as I mentioned on my call notes, there's other projects that come on in 2016, like Spectra's Gulf Markets Expansion and Rover Phase 1. And as each of those projects occurs and the supply and demand inside the basin equal out a little bit, basis should contract. So, I think we're one of the most capital-efficient companies in terms of growth. Plus, we're \u2013 given our unique portfolio of marketing contracts, I think our netbacks improve next year.", "But I think a really important slide that I'd like to refer everyone to is slide eight on our website. And it's a slide that shows what our production growth has been with time plotted against the dollars of capital per incremental mcfe of production. And if you look at that, you can see consistently, really for the last five years, our capital efficiency has gotten better. If you hone in just on 2015 versus 2014 and you look at the blue line on the graph, we're getting 20% growth, but the blue line, our capital \u2013 our costs are down literally 50%. Dollars per incremental capital were 50% less in 2015 than they were in 2014 through a combination of better completion, better targeting, lower service costs.", "And I really applaud Ray and the entire operations team. If you had asked me at any point in time, this time last year, where would we have been, I wouldn't have predicted we would have been able to reduce that by 50%; but it speaks to the quality of the team and the ROC in our position.", "So, when you \u2013 20% growth in 2015 for $870 million CapEx is, I think, outstanding. Next year we get better pricing, but I don't think our efficiencies go to zero in 2016. I think \u2013 I'm not saying we're going to knock 50% off, but I think that you'll see significant improvement in capital efficiency when you look at 2016 versus 2015 if we're sitting here at this time next year.", "So I think that's really important. And that efficiency will come from \u2013 again, where our laterals this year averaged about 6,000 feet with x stages that's in our work, you'll see us, I think, continue to migrate towards longer laterals with more stages and all of those types of things, plus we'll have a full year's worth of service contract benefit that we didn't have this year. So I think all that speaks to better performance in 2016 than in 2015.", "I think there's a couple other ways to look at it as well. Ray mentioned we're going to be carrying in almost double the number of wells into 2016 that we normally would in a typical year; so almost 50 wells to 60 wells instead of 20 wells to 30 wells. So, the drilling costs are in this year. The completion \u2013 just the completion costs are in next year, so that's going to be really capital-efficient growth with that.", "And I think if you look at us versus our competitors, if you look at our fourth quarter 2015 exit rate versus fourth quarter 2014, we should be growing roughly 15% fourth quarter 2015 over 2014. So we've had that continual ramp up in growth, so we're going to be entering 2016 with good growth versus a lot of our peers, who'll be flat over that same timeframe \u2013 or, in fact, some of them will be down.", "So, I think all those things are important and, again, hopefully give you some things to think about in terms of how you might model 2016. We don't want to be premature. Again, would I have predicted we would have knocked 50% off of our capital efficiency and grown 20% for $870 million? I wouldn't have, but I predict Ray and the team will step up, again, big time for 2016 and you'll see good improvement in those numbers.", "But I can also tell you we'll look hard as we go throughout the year at what oil and gas prices are in 2016. We'll look very hard at the returns. We just recently updated the economics and returns of all of our areas where we're spending money in the book, and we'll continue to do that. We will be very prudent with our balance sheet and will be sensitive to that. And given that, I think we're in good shape for 2016. Kind of a long answer, but an important question.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "I guess a follow-on to that \u2013 maybe if you don't want to give more clarity, that's great, but the second half capital run rate of plus \u2013 a little bit under $300 million, if you were running on that run rate, can you just still \u2013 with those completion backlog, can you still kind of stay on track and hit that 20%, or 15% to 20% type growth or \u2013 I'm trying to get a sense of growth versus CapEx dollars to be able to compare with cash flow/liquidity.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me try it at a high level and maybe Roger or Ray will chime in. You're right. I mean, we're not going to come out with specific numbers at this point in time. Again, if we would've done that last year \u2013 I've been with the company, now, 12 years or 13 years. I would have missed \u2013 every year our team has outperformed my expectations year after year. Plus, we don't want to get ahead of our board. We want to run it by them. And we want to look at prices as we get closer to the year.", "That being said, I think you'll see significant improvements. Just like on page 8, you've seen year after year after year with better contracts, better netbacks; so carrying a big inventory in, exiting the year high with improved capital efficiency. So I think, again, if \u2013 in terms of growth for the dollar spent, if we aren't at the head of the class, I think we'll be near the head of the class with some of the best contracts there. And actually on page 8, our IR team has looked at all of our competitors and looked at every single company in the basin and out \u2013 peers out of the basin and, based on our work, I think we're \u2013 if we aren't one, we're two; but I think we're actually one.", "Ray or Roger, do you want to add to that or no?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I think, talking about the run rate the second half of this year, we're still absolutely committed, again, to the $870 million CapEx budget that we had set, and we're still on target to deliver 20% growth for the year. So all of that has been part of our model going forward. Typically, capital budgets are always a little bit front-end-loaded, but just taking that run rate and running straight through 2016 I don't think is a good way to look at it because we'll probably ramp activity up a little bit in the first half of the next \u2013 or the first quarter, for sure, into that better pricing environment, and so forth, as we always try to do.", "So I think the kind of the shape of our growth profile will be about the same as it's been most years.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "But I think we're in good shape. We're going to \u2013 2015 should be a good year and, particularly, we should end strong with two new contracts kicking in, Spectra and the Mariner East. And with carrying the wells in, exiting high and with the continued improved efficiencies, we'll be sensitive to the balance sheet and to the economics; but I think we're in good shape.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "All right. Let me get back in queue. Thank you, guys.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Ron", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, everybody.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Jeff, I apologize for laboring the last question. Maybe I'm going to ask it slightly differently, or a different take on it. What would it take, in your view, to hold 2016 production flat? I know that's probably \u2013 with Range, that's probably a bit of an unrealistic scenario, but from a CapEx point of view, do you have a kind of ballpark? What do you think it would take to just hold the production flat from here? And I've got a follow-up, please.", "Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Doug. This is Roger. Let me take a swing at it. I'll answer some of that how we've answered this question before. When you take our anticipated 2015 production times our F&D costs \u2013 and you can pick any F&D costs. It's in the appendix of the book on any of our key plays. You end up with a maintenance capital to replace our reserves of around $200 million to $220 million. So, I think that's one bookend for you \u2013 for folks to think about.", "The other bookend, of course, is what Jeff just mentioned, that in 2015 we've gotten 20% growth at $870 million with anticipated additional efficiencies going into 2016 for a lot of the reasons that were just mentioned. So I think you can look at those as two bookends.", "Another thing I would add is just that something a lot of folks forget about is we really have, if not the highest R/P ratios, one of the highest R/P ratios out there, particularly of a shale producer and \u2013 especially if you look at just the proved developed producing reserves and that ratio. So, we have a much shallower decline, which means it's a lot easier to replace production.", "So I know I'm not getting to the exact number, but, like Jeff said, we don't have a micrometer for 2016 right now. But I think, hopefully, that will help you with bookending the answer.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "It does, Roger. But it kind of begs another question, I guess, which is, I suppose, an issue facing all you guys right now is that if your assets are that good, which they clearly are and with the Utica, they're probably \u2013 the portfolio shift is probably going to see an even better aggregate for the whole high-grade portfolio, if you like. Why accelerate or push the growth in this environment when, historically, your shares have been given an equal recognition for debt-adjusted growth; in other words, the shoring of the balance sheet, the strength of the balance sheet and so on, as opposed to growing the top line? I'm just \u2013 from a strategy point of view, how are you guys reconciling that? Why not wait a year and then push the growth once things sort themselves out from a commodity standpoint?", "Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, again, Doug, I mean, it's not like we have a growth number and we're just not telling you. I mean, we just don't have the facts to make that decision, yet. So, in answer to your question, we've never been about growth for growth's sake. And we're not going to start now. We're going to be mindful of the forward curve. We're going to be mindful of the supply and demand balance, our optionality to drill, where the best opportunities are and the balance sheet. So, we're going to triangulate on all of those variables to come up with the right growth percentage. But at this point, it's just too early to predict on what that might be.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, and I would add in a little bit. Historically \u2013 if you go back historically over the last several years, we've talked about growing 20% to 25%. And I've always \u2013 and I'm sure you've heard it, and all the people in one-on-ones, and to draw home the point I take silly examples of gases and nickel. We're not going to grow at 20%; or if gas is going to be $10 flat, we'll grow higher than 25%. But that's been kind of reasonable target. It's interesting over that timeframe, for the most part, prior to the last year, people have challenged us, why didn't we grow faster?", "And we also stuck to our guns on what we thought was a reasonable and prudent plan. If you look at this year, it's very interesting. Again, we wanted to be reasonable and prudent where prices were. We cut $700 million out. And at that point, we weren't even targeting growth. We were just saying: how capital efficient could we be? The 20% fell out of that and then happened to be kind of in line with 20% to 25%, but there was really nothing magical. That's just the quality of the team and the rock.", "And, again, if you had asked me, could Ray and the team, on page 8, knock 50% off of our capital efficiency from 2015 versus 2014, I wouldn't have said that last year. They did \u2013 went above and beyond, which, again, speaks to the quality of the rock and the team. We'll approach 2016 and 2017 and beyond in that same fashion.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I appreciate the full answer, fellows. My follow-up is hopefully a little quicker, because we're only talking about six rigs at the end of the year. Given you're still, I guess, testing the Utica set of your portfolio mix, how should we think about allocation of those rigs as we roll into the end of the year? And I'll leave it at that. Thank you.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, the Utica, like I said earlier, I think we'll have both of the first two wells online here in the next month or so into the new infrastructure, and we'll be able to produce them consistently at that point. And we're going to need to watch them for a couple of three months or so to get an idea what those wells are going to look like on an ultimate performance standpoint.", "The third well will get completed sometime early in 2016. So, we'll have three wells. And one of the things I'll point out, when you couple that with some of the recent wells that have been announced around us, it really proves up our math that we've had in the book for over a year now. And I think it really helps delineate our 400,000-acre position, which is the biggest position out there. And it's going to give us a big, big lever going forward for some really capital efficient growth when the time's right.", "But like Jeff and Roger have pointed out really well, I think, at this point it's just too early to know how we're going to allocate those rigs to potential Utica wells in 2016 or not. I think we'll look at the economics. We'll look at the cost. We'll look at the markets and our new transportation deals and the customers that are coming online. We'll have to look at all of those things to see how that rolls out when we present our budget to the board in December.", "And then, like we've done every year, we'll continue to manage that budget as we go throughout the year and reallocate capital to the best returns. That's what we've always done and that's part of what's been able to drive our capital efficiency.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And I would just point out, it's nice that the Utica stacked with the Marcellus and with the Upper Devonian. Really, the Marcellus that we're drilling will hold all of that acreage. So, in essence, it's kind of a free option on what may be the biggest and potentially the best Utica position out there, which could drive capital efficiencies in 2016 and beyond and continue to make us more capital efficient.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Appreciate the answer, guys. Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Doug.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Wolff. Please proceed with your question from Jefferies. Jon, your line is live.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Hello. It was on mute. Good morning. How are you?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning, Jon.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Few things, since I'm getting a tremendous amount of questions, maybe we could just clear up. So, number one, on \u2013 a little bit of confusion out there on Marcellus versus Utica. And my response has been that there's quite a long inventory, a very differentiated inventory, in the Marcellus that is highly capital productive and people are thinking why does Range need Utica right now. I completely understand why you want to test the potential. I guess, so just thinking about that and the high rates of the wells and the added midstream infrastructure or the takeaway from the pads, how does that sort of color your view, or is it \u2013 I assume it's a low capital item that may kick in over time.", "And related to that, CONSOL reported a very strong well test in Westmoreland, which is kind of in around your acreage. Any reactions to that? But the bigger one is just the capital productivity returns at this point given your just huge Marcellus inventory. How do the two compete, and how do you think about that?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me start, and Ray or Roger might chime in. You know, we agree. I mean, the low-risk, high-quality, strong return is the Marcellus. That's where we're focused and that's where \u2013 95% of our capital is going into that. It's important, we think, to drill a few wells, and we picked three to give us a feel for what the Utica could be; plus, like Ray said, it's encouraging with the well in Westmoreland County and the ETP well.", "Actually, you can see it on our website. I think they're still up there. Bill Zagorski did a presentation with SunTrust that's much more detailed in terms of the Utica. And you can see where those wells are and how they delineate our acreage and help de-risk our acreage. And again, being stacked pay is important. We're getting some phenomena right now. Some of the strongest returns we have are in the dry Marcellus, but the takeaway for the dry Marcellus could be used at some point for dry Utica. And so all that stuff kind of stacks together. The wells we're drilling are off of existing Marcellus pads with Marcellus roads. It's the same team. We've already paid for the acreage. It's already held by the Marcellus. So it's kind of an option.", "So we'll stay focused on the Marcellus, but to the extent we learn more about the Utica and to the extent the Utica economics ultimately compete with the Marcellus, then you may see us allocate some capital there in a very disciplined way in order to maximize our returns and to \u2013 as we go forward.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Jon. I mean, one of the things that we're considering is \u2013 the Utica we're three wells into this, or two-and-a-half wells into it if you want to say that that way right now, and we're \u2013 a couple of things we need to understand is the production characteristics of the well and what we believe the cost can get down to. And so far, everything is meeting our expectations that's not exceeding our expectations.", "We still believe we can get the costs down, and we still believe the wells are going to perform. And, clearly, with the Westmoreland County well from CNX and the EQT well, which I'll be the first to congratulate both of them, those are monster wells. But we really believe that just helps prove up what we've been saying for a year or so now, that this is going to be a great lever for Range to push going forward. And when you start thinking about the gas markets three years, four years, five years out, that's where we really see the Utica being highly potential for us.", "Like Jeff said, we're holding all the acreage with the Marcellus wells. That's where our best returns are. Some of those Marcellus wells, there's probably nothing in the world that's going to compete with them. They're just that good.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "But if the Utica ever does, even in the shorter term, we'll just allocate a little bit of the capital there.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "You'll see us work it in...", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, from a land perspective, any one well (46:55) one horizon holds all of it so...", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Right. Right. I'm just \u2013 just wanted (47:02) \u2013 yeah.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "(47:03) Okay, Jon.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Is the messaging really that \u2013 I mean, is this going to be potentially a 10% capital item next year? I would assume less than that. I mean...", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It's too early to say.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I know we're driving you guys crazy a little bit. We think about those things hard, but we actually try to factor in the most recent data as we go into the year and most prudently allocate capital to where it's best for the company.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. That's fair. And on the Westmoreland results just on a closeology basis, or however you want to think about it, what does that tell you about some of your more eastern acreage?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, if you \u2013 like Jeff said, if you look at on our website, there's a presentation that Bill Zagorski made at a SunTrust conference. And on page five, there's a great map and has that well and the recent EQT well highlighted. And if you look at the map, it fits right in with what we've said all along. And if you see the outlines on the map, you'll see we've got a considerable amount of acreage offsetting both those wells. So, again, it helps just prove up what we've been saying for some amount of time. We've got 400,000 acres that we think is highly prospective. And as time is going forward, it's just getting better and better.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We probably have the largest position, and the good news is it's stacked right underneath our high-quality Marcellus. And there's still good Upper Devonian on top of it. Yeah, it all helps.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Two more quick ones on \u2013 I think I get the concept around the weak NGL realization in the field, like you had to deal with other ways to evacuate, like rail, which we're hearing $0.25 to $0.30 cost. Obviously, it's transitory for Range, but is that \u2013 I know you got some sales into Marcus Hook, but I imagine it was a small number. As you \u2013 as the Mariner East gets commissioned, my guess is that that $0.25 falls to something less than $0.10. Is that fair?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I'd answer it this way. It's \u2013 again, we have \u2013 we're the only producer that has a position on Mariner East I, and we have 40,000 barrels per day, 20,000 barrels per day of propane, 20,000 barrels per day of ethane. The 20,000 barrels per day of propane covers basically all of our propane production. And we've said, and we still believe, when you consider \u2013 take Mariner East, Mariner West, and our whole portfolio, once that's up and running, and Sonoco is still saying end of the third quarter, a little commissioning, so call it early fourth quarter, on an annualized basis, it's about a $90 million uplift for us net of transportation; about half of that is savings on the transportation side on propane. So, hopefully, that's enough clarity into what that looks like.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Yeah. And last one on the \u2013 yeah. Go ahead.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, and, again, don't forget Spectra. That's August 1 of this year. So, that's like next week, the 200 million cubic feet a day. That takes a huge portion of our production out of M2 into a better market and we've hedged that uplift, which is \u2013 it will be a nice uplift for us. And again, we have \u2013 we're an anchor shipper. We have a huge part of the volume on that project, 200 million cubic feet per day.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Right. Last one. When I saw you last time, you talked about there being at least a small arb between Mont Belvieu to Europe, or rather versus \u2013 Mont Belvieu to Europe versus Marcus Hook to Europe. Do you feel good about being able to at least market those propane barrels overseas?", "Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development", "Yeah. John, this is...", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Just in terms of liquidity?", "Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development", "This is Chad Stephens. Yeah. One of things we're excited about is the ability to take advantage of any available arbs. To date, we've been selling the propane on what they call handy ships, very inefficient loading, less barrels. You've got to use more ships. Transportation costs are higher.", "Once Mariner East is in service, we'll be loading VLGC ships, about 500,000 barrels per ship, and we'll be taking advantage of the arb between Rotterdam, the ARA Rotterdam Index, South America, Mont Belvieu, and the FEI Index in Asia. And that's both \u2013 you can take advantage of either lower transportation costs and/or better index prices as you play those arbs around the world. And so, we're real excited about the ability to do that.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And we think we'll get better pricing. The $90 million does not include any uplift on pricing. That's just counting the transportation savings and the other contracts. So it could be better than that, and we expect that it will be better than that.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Got it. I had one more, but I forgot it. So that was long enough. Thanks so much for the color.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Jon.", "Operator", "We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Blaise Angelico of IBERIA for our final question.", "Blaise Matthew Angelico - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Blaise Matthew Angelico - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC", "Just one quick thing. Can you talk about well costs and where service prices are trending? Do you see any additional relief coming over the balance of the year? And then, second, I know you don't have long-term service contracts in place. Do you maybe step in now and lock in that lower service cost with long-term contracts? Just kind of curious as to how you guys are thinking about all of these given the macro environment.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, great question, Blaise. The service costs have clearly come down a lot this year. And like I said in my prepared remarks at the beginning of the call, on an apples-to-apples basis, when you look at what we've seen the first half of this year compared to the second half of last year, and you just pick Southwest PA, for instance \u2013 some areas are more, some are less, but just pick Southwest PA. We're 25% or more less total well cost. And that's a range of all sorts of things: less cost for the drilling rigs, frac costs coming down, directional drillers, all of that sort of thing. And we are still seeing some of those prices come down because, like Jeff said in his remarks at the beginning, the rig counts are down in the Utica by 66%. They're down in the Marcellus by, what, over 50%; I think close to 55% now. The other basins are seeing the same kind of thing.", "So there's a lot of competition out there. The service providers are having to really pick the people they want to work for and really having to hammer down on their suppliers. So, you're seeing this continual bump down of lower cost, going all the way down into things like steel and proppants and guar gum for friction reducing \u2013 all those sort of chemicals and everything else are getting cheaper.", "So I think it would be pretty aggressive \u2013 probably too aggressive to think that we're going to see as much of a decrease as we've seen so far, but I do think we'll see more as all of this tries to settle out at some level of constant activity. I think because of our kind of well-planned and disciplined approach and the way we try to really focus on utilization of the frac crews and so forth, that gives us a leg up. And the fact that we didn't have any long-term contracts was a big advantage to the team. I think it's still a big advantage to the team.", "We're much more a believer, philosophically, in long-term relationships rather than long-term contracts, because we really try to make it a win-win relationship with our service providers. And when you \u2013 I think we're living proof of the fact that that's allowed us as a company to attract some of the best pricing and some of the lowest well cost. And all that translates into the best capital efficiency, I think, in the basin. So that's our philosophy going forward.", "I think the other thing you'll see going into 2016 is we'll have a full year of these price reductions, which will really help our capital efficiency. So, I don't know that \u2013 we'll probably still see some decrease here and there, but the fact that we'll be able to apply what we've seen thus far to a full year is really what's going to help us next year, plus the fact that we have a bigger inventory. We got better contracts. We got Mariner East up and running. We got Spectra Uniontown to Gas City. We got Rover and the Gulf expansion coming on late next year. All of those things that we've been talking about on the call are really going to help set 2016 up very, very well.", "Blaise Matthew Angelico - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC", "Appreciate the color, guys.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his closing remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "The first half of 2015 has been challenging for Range and our industry. The good news for Range is that we have two significant marketing events that are projected to commence in the second half of the year, which are Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City project and Mariner East I. Combined, they should result in a significant increase to our netback price we receive for our gas, ethane and propane. We're on track to spend approximately $700 million less in 2015 than 2014 and grow our production volumes 20%.", "We believe that we'll have the most capital efficient growth versus any of our Appalachian peers on a corporate basis. Importantly, with our 1.6 million acre of stacked pay potential in the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian, we have the option to drill dry, wet gas or super-rich acreage since about 900,000 net acres are dry and the rest is split between wet and super-rich.", "In essence, this gives us a portfolio within our portfolio. Coupling this resource base with our capital discipline and diversified portfolio of marketing arrangements, which gives us multiple options that are our competitors do not have, Range is positioned to create value as we move forward into an expected better market that balances supply, demand and infrastructure.", "Thanks for participating on the call.

We apologize immensely for the delay for today's call. Thank you very much for standing by today. We want to welcome you today to the Range Resources Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney L. Waller - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome. Range reported results for the third quarter 2015 with record production, a continuing decrease in unit costs and some outstanding well results. The order of our speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, Chairman, President and CEO; Ray Walker, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Executive Vice President and Chief Finance Officer.", "Range did file our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on your website under the Investors tag, or you can access it using the SEC's Edgar system. In addition, we've posted on our website complemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins, unit costs per mcfe and the reconciliation of reported earnings to our adjusted non-GAAP earnings that are discussed on the call today.", "Now let me turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Rodney. It will come as no surprise to anyone on this call when I say that the third quarter was difficult. In the commodity business you go through cycles. Those of us who have seen a few of these cycles recall what they feel like, the difficult decisions that must be made, but ultimately the companies with the right assets and strategy will emerge better for it. The Range team has navigated these cycles before, and has designed the company to consistently create value for its shareholders over time. You have all heard these tenets before, but they bear repeating when we distracted by minute-by-minute price updates.", "We believe value is created year after year by having a large position in the core of a low-cost play, a great team that consistently and safely executes the business plan and a strong simple balance sheet. Going a little deeper into each of these points, first, Range has the largest position in the lowest-cost play in North America. There is also tremendous additional potential upside in form of the Utica, downspacing in the Marcellus, the Upper Devonian, extending laterals and having size and scale. This resource has been captured and is largely held by production, which allows Range to be disciplined in its activity levels.", "Second, a team that consistently executes. For over a decade, the Range team has grown production at almost a 20% compound annual growth rate. This was accomplished despite periods of declining prices and high service cost. This team pioneered the Marcellus and helped bring other technical innovations into the mainstream, for example, water recycling and reduced cluster spacing.", "Marketing has been another area of solid execution with a history of firsts, including our first in obtaining takeaway capacity and the upcoming exports of ethane and propane out of Marcus Hook. I believe that you'll see more firsts from Range.", "Third, the balance sheet is a foundation that enables the company to execute its strategy. Range has prudently managed its balance sheet in a consistent manner for many years. As an operating-strategy driven company, we focus first on rigorous capital allocation to be good stewards of our shareholders' money. That has focused Range on building one of the best drilling inventories in the business. It has also led us to shed noncore assets totaling north of $3 billion over the last 10 years. Liquidity and financial flexibility are important, and we develop this just as we do our drilling inventory. We are well positioned, with a carefully structured bank credit facility with ample liquidity and a long-term debt portfolio with staggered maturities.", "In addition, we continue to make progress on our noncore asset sales, and we expect to announce one or more asset sales and close them by the end of this year. We will use the proceeds to pay down debt, further strengthening our balance sheet.", "Turning to the third quarter, another three months of strong operating performance drove 20% growth in production. A relentless focus on costs and efficiency yielded a 12% reduction in our unit costs over the prior-year quarter. This came against a continued backdrop of weak product prices, which more than offset lower costs. The good news is that two of the projects which I mentioned last quarter should help with fourth quarter pricing netbacks.", "Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City project became fully operational on September 1. This transportation allows us to move about 170 million per day net from local M2 Appalachian Index to Midwest markets. The net effect is it has increased our netback price by more than $1 on this volume, and we expect that we'll see a continued uplift of $0.75 to $1 for the fourth quarter.", "The other project I mentioned during our last quarterly call was Mariner East I. Our understanding is that Mariner East I will be fully operational by the end of this year. When operational, this project should result in a significant uplift on our ethane and propane pricing netbacks. We are the only producer that has capacity on this project, and we have 40,000 barrels per day comprised of half ethane and half propane. We expect a $90 million uplift in our net cash flow on an annualized basis when combing the net effects from Mariner East, Mariner West and ATEX.", "For 2016 we have projected bookends for capital spending of $550 million to $890 million. Both cases give us good growth within or near cash flow, depending on the price forecast used. We believe that if you look at the capital we're spending in 2015 for the growth we're achieving, we have the most capital efficient growth on a corporate basis versus any of our peers in the Appalachian or in any other basin. We believe in 2016 our capital efficiency will also be at or near the top of the peers.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ray.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Jeff. During the first three quarters of this year we've demonstrated capital discipline, we've increased operational efficiency, we've further lowered our cost structure and continued to meet our production targets while staying within our $870 million capital budget. Third quarter production was better than expected at 1.445 Bcf equivalent per day, again largely driven by improved performance in the dry gas area of Southwest Pennsylvania, and we're still on track to deliver approximately 20% year-over-year production growth.", "Our Marcellus growth is forecasted to be 26% year over year. With our reduced capital spending in the fourth quarter and Mariner East starting up later than originally planned, our fourth quarter production is expected to average about 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day. Our latest communications with Sunoco indicate that the Mariner East startup should occur in the next month, with full commercial operations for propane and ethane by the end of the year.", "Thinking ahead about the bookends for next year's plan, we expect that our production growth profile in 2016 to be consistent with previous years. Importantly, our 2016 exit rate being higher than this year's exit rate, again setting us up for growth in 2017. Our cost metrics are consistently improving on both an absolute and on a per-unit basis. Corporate LOE per mcfe for the quarter was down 21% as compared to last year, and G&A per mcfe is down 26%.", "We've made additional progress in operating efficiencies and reducing capital costs. I'll start with some highlights from Southwest Pennsylvania, where most of our capital is being invested. To give you an idea of just how much progress we've made in drilling cost, for the last two months, August and September, our average lateral length has increased by 38% over the average for 2014. Despite drilling 38% longer laterals, our drilling costs per well have actually declined by 10%. We recently finished a five-well pad at 45% less cost per foot as compared to 2014. This was all accomplished by a combination of service cost reductions, the application of improved drilling technology and improved drilling efficiencies.", "On the completion side, we've achieved a 44% increase in frac stages per day as compared to last year. Three recent pads totaling 427 frac stages achieved an average between 8 and 10 stages per day. Combined with service cost reductions, we've seen completion cost drop by more than 34% compared to this time last year. We believe that these efficiencies can continue to improve going forward. We also believe that this is not the case for everyone. It's a distinct advantage for Range on two fronts, both on the capital efficiency side and the operational side. Today we have some of the best recoveries per foot of lateral combined with one of the lowest total well costs per foot of lateral generating some of the best economics in the Basin. Of course this is largely driven by our team and our large scale, stacked pay and high quality acreage position in Southwest Pennsylvania.", "One of the most important factors in improving capital efficiency is drilling longer laterals. Our average lateral length this year is about 6,000 feet, and we expect to see it closer to 7,000 feet next year and still growing longer after that. Most of our competitors in the Basin are already drilling long laterals and will not see the same gains in efficiency going forward. Therefore, we see an advantage with our capital efficiency increasing steadily in the future as we go forward with longer and longer laterals.", "The other distinct advantage is our operating efficiency. For example, we know that we frac more stages per day and have less downtime on our completions than any operator in the Basin. Service providers know this and benefit with better utilization rates when they're on one of our locations. This generates a win-win situation for both us and the service company, resulting in Range receiving some of the best pricing in the Basin while the service companies maintain their margins.", "Importantly, we're also continuing to see outstanding well performance. Recently we brought online a new five-well pad in the dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania. The wells are producing under constrained conditions into a high-pressure gathering system, with an average initial sales rate per well of over 26 million a day. The five wells averaged 8,200-foot laterals with 42 stages. I also want to emphasize that the total well cost, including facilities, was less than $900 per foot.", "Now that we have more production history, I would also like to update you on a five-well pad in the wet area that we reported on earlier this year. The average initial sales rate of the five wells was 18 million cubic feet equivalent per day under constraint conditions and had 120-day average of 8.5 million a day. The average EUR per 1,000-foot for the five wells on the pad is 4 Bcf equivalent per 1,000-foot, and those wells averaged 5,700-foot laterals completed with 30 stages. The total well cost for these wells, including facilities, was less than $1,000 per foot, again, emphasizing class leading costs with 4 bcfe per 1,000-foot, which is one of the best recoveries in the entire Basin. Again, the rock rules. Both our dry and liquids rich wells in the Marcellus and Southwest Pennsylvania continue to deliver outstanding results and are a real testament to our operations and technical teams.", "As we continue to drill longer laterals, we expect to see even better performance. Our first two Utica wells in Washington County, Pennsylvania are now producing into the new dry gas pipeline, and we're currently drilling the third well on a nearby pad, expected to complete that well early next year. Our reservoir modeling for the first well, which is based on extensive reservoir measurements and production history, puts the EUR in the range of 15 Bcf from a 5,400-foot lateral with 32 stages.", "On a normalized basis that's approximately 2.8 Bcf per 1,000-foot of lateral and is in the top tier of Utica wells to date. Again, looking at all the production data from across the entire Utica play, our first well appears to be in the top-10 performers on both an absolute and a per-1,000-foot basis. And the second well is better.", "Remember, the first two wells are opposing laterals off the same pad, but the completions were different. The first well was completed with 400,000 pounds of proppant per stage, or approximately 2,400 pounds per foot. And the second well was completed with 500,000 pounds per stage, or a little over 3,000 pounds per foot. Both wells incorporated 100 mesh sand and 30/50 ceramic proppant and were similar in reservoir pressure, as you would expect, being direct opposing offsets.", "On the second well, we also utilized the choke management program designed to manage the near well bore drawdown. The second well is currently flowing to sales at approximately 13 million a day. It's been online a very short time, but early indications suggest it will be better than the first. It was a 5,200-foot lateral also completed with 32 stages. As we evaluate these two wells and continue to develop our reservoir modeling, we will let the data and the modeling guide us in optimizing the completion design for our third well.", "The third well is AFE-ed, (15:10) for a total completed well cost of $15.9 million for a 6,500-foot lateral. This includes facilities, diagnostics, additional science and new technology, mainly managed pressure drilling equipment, allowing us to keep drilling under the large pressure swings that have been seen by us and others in Southwest Pennsylvania. We believe as time goes on and we get more of these wells under our belt that we'll see between 20% and 30% reductions in total well cost resulting from technology advancements and operational efficiencies combined with improving well performance.", "We have 400,000 net acres of what we believe is core dry Utica. Early wells drilled by us and our offset competitors in Southwest Pennsylvania are promising, and certainly help to prove up and delineate the Range acreage position. But those five or so wells have only limited production history to date. We plan to gather data from the offset activity combined with our wells, and while we focus on the Marcellus in the near term, just like the super rich, wet and dry Marcellus and Upper Devonian, our Utica play could be another complementary large-scale and low-risk option in our portfolio, with good economics for dry gas growth. Activity in Northeast Pennsylvania and in our Midcontinent division slowed dramatically in the third quarter, and today both areas have finished their capital spend for the year.", "Our Fort Worth team, which now operates both areas, has done an excellent job of lowering costs and focusing on optimizing production and revenue. Our Southern Appalachian team in Nora is also finished for the year with its capital spending. They're continuing to bring online some of the best coalbed methane wells we've seen in years. In fact, over the past 30 years, four of the top-five wells are the new design, and 11 of the top-30 wells are wells that we have drilled and completed since taking over full operational control of the properties in 2014. Utilizing the new high rate and larger size frac technique, the recent CBM wells are 75% better than their average offsets, with significantly better economics. And again, this area has some of the best gas pricing in the Eastern U.S. It's large scale, low risk and has very low declines.", "Environmental protection, regulatory compliance, employee safety and having positive relationships in the communities where we live and work remain top priorities in our operations. In Southwest Pennsylvania, we had no reportable spills in the third quarter, and we'll work hard to repeat that success going forward.", "Employee and management commitment to safety has resulted in Range having only one OSHA-recordable injury thus far in 2015 and zero hours of lost time in the last 21 months. We are really proud of all of our operating teams for working safely, protecting the environment and being good stewards in the communities where we live and work.", "Now, over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Ray. Financially, the third quarter of 2015 was much like the second quarter, with significantly lower realized prices across all commodities set against significantly lower costs and consistent capital efficient growth. Year-over-year production growth for the quarter was 20%, and all-in realized prices were down by 36% from the third quarter of last year. We continue to improve our already low cost structure by reducing cash unit costs by $0.23 from last year, a 12% decrease. All of our individual unit cost categories were at or below guidance, with another quarter of most expense categories coming in below last year on an absolute dollar basis as well.", "Fourth quarter line item expense guidance may be found in the third quarter earnings press release. Revenue from natural gas, oil and NGL sales, including cash settled derivatives, was $390 million for the third quarter, a $7 million increase from the second quarter of this year but $73 million below last year's third quarter. EBITDAX for the third quarter was $209 million and third quarter cash flow was $169 million or $1.01 per fully diluted share. Year-to-date third quarter EBITDAX was $656 million and year-to-date cash flow totals $536 million.", "Net loss on a GAAP basis for the third quarter was $301 million, driven primarily by $502 million of pre-tax proved property impairments from some of our legacy shallow gas areas in Northwest Pennsylvania and oil properties in Northern Oklahoma. The properties impaired are non-core assets. Year to date, less than 3% of total company production came from these impaired assets.", "Non-GAAP earnings reflecting common analyst methodology, which removes many non-cash and nonrecurring items, was $5.5 million or $0.03 per fully diluted share. Both non-GAAP earnings and cash flow per share for the quarter were higher than the second quarter and above analysts' consensus.", "NYMEX strip oil prices were 16.5% lower at September 30 than June 30, and strip gas prices were 10% lower. The fact that revenue, cash flow, EBITDAX and adjusted earnings were all higher in the third quarter of this year than the second quarter speaks to the responsiveness of the company to the current industry environment through continued cost cutting and capital efficient growth.", "Turning to the balance sheet, the most significant improvement completed during the third quarter was the redemption of our old 6.75% notes. Listeners may recall that we issued $750 million of 4.875% notes during the second quarter, effectively replacing our 6.75% notes, which were not callable until the third quarter. Having used the bank credit facility to bridge the two transactions, we redeemed the 6.75% notes in August using the bank credit facility.", "The refinancing reduces our corporate weighted average bond interest rate by 42 basis points, generating just under $11 million of annual interest expense savings. Also, the redemption of our 6.75% notes places our earliest bond maturity in the year 2021. We remain well hedged in 2016 with a floor gas price of $3.42 an Mcf on over half our anticipated 2016 gas production. Hedging activity during the third quarter, summarized in the earnings release and Range website, consisted of several new oil hedges and some natural gas basis swaps. All in all, a challenging but solid quarter with higher revenue, production, cash flow and lower costs sequentially from the second quarter.", "In the fourth quarter we look forward to continued year-over-year growth, cost focus and balance sheet improvement. Jeff, over to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Ventura. The question-and-answer session will now begin. The first question comes today from Matt Portillo with TPH.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, guys.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Thank you very much for the color on your initial thoughts around the Utica. I was hoping to get potentially a little bit more around development plans on the asset. You've laid out an EUR for the first well and an updated well cost. How do you think about incremental capital spend on the Utica heading into 2016 and 2017 versus the current Marcellus and how those two projects potentially compete for capital?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. It's a great question. If you look on our website on slide 11, it lays out the economics for the Marcellus. And the good news for us is, our wells, we have all depth rights. So we hold everything, basically: the Marcellus; the Utica; the Upper Devonian; and every horizon up and down the wellbore.", "So what we know is we're encouraged by our first and second Utica wells, and the wells in and around us. And we think, just like we've been saying for a long time, that the drycore, the best part of the drycore of the Utica, we believe, will be down in Southwest Pennsylvania. We hold a big chunk of it; a few other operators do too. But the good part for us is it's stacked on top \u2013 it's right below the Marcellus. So we're encouraged by the Utica. We've drilled our two wells, as Ray said, we're drilling the third, and we'll complete it next year.", "When you look at our plan for next year, our focus is going to be really on the Marcellus. We think, with those three wells, coupled with the activity in and around us, it'll give us a really good handle on what the Utica ultimately is. And we're encouraged by what it could be. But what we know is we have 10 years' worth of production history and thousands of wells that delineate, really, our position. So that's the low-risk piece.", "And again, on slide 16, when you look at our Marcellus wells right now, the EURs per thousand-foot average for this year 2.5 to 3, and Ray said, our better pad is as high as 4 Bcf per thousand-foot. Coupled with costs that range down there, you're looking at about $900,000 to $1 million per thousand-foot. Or maybe said a little more simply, our Marcellus wells down there are basically 17 to almost 18 Bcf wells that cost roughly $6 million. So we view it as a complementary development, and we can speak for Range, we're going to put our capital where we're getting the most, the best returns and the best capital efficiency, coupled with the lowest risk.", "So we're excited and encouraged by what the Utica could be. But in the short run, you're going to see our focus be totally on the Marcellus. And we think with our wells and the other wells that'll be drilled in and around us, that'll help delineate our Utica position, but we won't be spending a lot of dollars on science. We'll put them into the strong return Marcellus wells that we have.", "Kind of a long-winded answer, but hopefully, Matt, that addressed your question.", "Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. I know that you have a short queue so I'll jump back in.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bob Brackett with Sanford Bernstein.", "Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Can you give a little more color on noncore asset sales? What's noncore? Is there a preference for oil versus gas? How do you think about pricing that you might get for those assets?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Great question, Bob. And I really look forward to sharing the details on the asset sales, and when we can. We feel, I feel and our team feels, very confident that we're going to get one or more of those done prior to the end of the year. It's interesting, when you look back, it's a consistent part of our strategy. We've sold over $3 billion worth of noncore assets really over the last 10 years. Thinking about that another way, the remaining assets that we have are noncore are high quality. So we've seen a lot of interest in those assets that are high quality. And basically, you can see us putting almost all of our capital into Pennsylvania and into the Marcellus. Therefore, we're not funding some of these high quality areas where some of our peers and competitors are showing a lot of interest. But again, I really look forward to sharing the details on those when we can, and feel confident that we'll get one or more done prior to the end of the year.", "Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Do you consider the Marcellus and the Utica core?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Clearly, the Marcellus is the engine. The Marcellus is what's driving our company. Again, we're looking at 17 Bcf wells for basically $6 million. That's about as good as it gets. And with our being a first mover and in essence \"having discovered it or pioneered it\" we have the cheapest transportation to some of the best markets. Some of these new transportation deals, like we have Spectra Uniontown to Gas City, an uplift of $0.75 to $1 on a huge portion of that in the fourth quarter. Mariner East propane and ethane are on the verge of starting up in the next 30 days, and it'll be fully on by the end of the year. That'll be a big uplift in our netbacks owning both of those. So clearly, we think that's core and strong. We have a big position. We have 1.6 million net acres of stack pay potential. That's clearly size and scale on what we believe is the highest quality play in North America.", "Even though those other assets are by definition noncore for us, they're not competing for capital and are not competing for returns, they're good properties. And we're seeing a lot of interest. So it would be the areas outside of there.", "Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question is from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Co.", "David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International", "Morning, guys.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International", "Real quickly on the Mariner East piece of the equation, can you talk a little bit about what's contributing to those delays? I know you've been informed by Sunoco that they'll have it fully operational by year end, but is it purely just timing of facility development, items like that? Or is there any regulatory issues? Just any kind of additional color you can give us there?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Dave. It's a good question. I can give a little bit of color. In the original plan, the startup was going to be in July with full operations for ethane and propane being basically full up and running in the fourth quarter. Of course, that's certainly been delayed. And again to repeat, they should have startup operations begin within the next 30 days, and we expect full operation to be basically right at the end of the year. And so that's sort of how we've got it in our plans going forward. I think I would characterize the delays as mainly construction.", "There were some permitting issues, and so forth and so on, but as you get closer to the imminent time that it starts up, sort of the over under, gets a lot \u2013 it's a lot more clarity in that decision. So we feel very confident. We, of course, we're in partnership and working with Eneos guys, the Chicago Bridge and Iron Works guys, we're almost in daily conversations with Sunoco. We've got people on the ground there. So we're very confident that things are going to begin commissioning and so forth in the next 30 days with, again, full operations right at the end of the year.", "David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International", "Okay. So just for clarification, you mentioned permitting. Has all of that been completed at this point or are you still waiting for something there?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. All the permits are completed. At this point, it's literally just the last part of electrician work, and commissioning of new operating systems and things like that.", "David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International", "Perfect. I appreciate that clarification. And then just one on CapEx for the balance this year. I know you guys are only going to be bringing 18 wells to sale since you brought a larger amount in Q3. How much or how many of those wells are yet to be drilled? Just trying to triangulate, because it's a pretty significant step-down in CapEx quarter over quarter to stay within that $870 million guidance?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Let me start by saying as strong as I can that I am absolutely confident we will be within our $870 million CapEx budget. I talk to the guys almost daily in the different operations. And like I said in my prepared remarks, clearly in Midcontinent, Northeast PA and in Nora we're finished. There's really not anything going on there. In the Marcellus we started the year with 15 rigs. We're down to five. I think we'll be four or five for the next couple of months. We may drop an air rig or something like that, but we literally watch that to the penny today. So we are absolutely confident that we'll end up there. And I think what they've laid out in the press release is exactly what we're going to bring online. That plan has been in place literally from the first and second quarter of the year. We went into it knowing that that's how it would turn out.", "David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International", "Great. I appreciate it.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "And again, our production \u2013 let me add one more thing. Again, our production profile, we don't expect to be going forward from starting next year we expect the growth profile in 2016, wherever we end up in the bookends, will be pretty consistent with quarter-over-quarter growth, just like we've seen in previous years. So we don't feel like we're sacrificing anything. The first quarter is going to be big. I think you're going to see us add a couple more frac crews in the first quarter, probably pick up a rig \u2013 all those things that we do every year when we start out a brand new budget year.", "David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International", "Okay. That's helpful. Just to that point, I guess, so you'd be leaning on those 50, 60 drilled, uncompleted wells to get Q1 production kind of up robustly versus the decline in Q4. Is that the correct way to think about it?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I know there's been a lot of questions about the drilled and uncompleted inventory, and when you look at the well counts, maybe it looks like there's more or less going into a year. But the way we typically tend to think about it today is in number of frac stages coming online, essentially. And if you look at the number of completed frac stages or yet-to-be-completed frac stages that we're going to bring online at any given time, it's about the same going in to 2016 as it was going into 2015. So there's not a lot of difference there, in our mind. And then going forward into 2017, I would expect it will be something very similar.", "David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International", "Okay. I appreciate that added color. Thank you, guys.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Dan E. McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you and good morning. Just to follow up on the last series of questions on 2016 and to clarify. Where we sit today, what growth scenario is more likely next year: the 10% or 20% case? And where does leverage sit in either case, applying strict pricing and assuming no proceeds from the asset sales?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me start the discussion and then I'll turn it over to Roger. In terms of capital budget for 2016, we have a process and we're going to continue with the process. We have a board meeting in December and we don't want to get ahead of the board. We'll present it to the board and typically we announce that in January.", "But to specifically answer your question. If where pricing is today, we would tend to be on the low end. We have the, of the bookends, given what we see today. And before I turn it over to Roger, let me say, as I said earlier, I feel very confident that we will complete one or more asset sales prior to year-end. But, Roger?", "Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I think when you look forward, it all depends, obviously, on the points you've made, Dan. What are prices going to be and how much you're going to spend. And on the lower end of the bookends, you're really not overspending at all, if not underspending. So in that case, like I said, the EBITDAX is up third quarter versus second. So if your EBITDAX is increasing, you're not overspending, then your leverage is improving, even without any asset sales. So if I look at the balance sheet; I don't lose any sleep over the balance sheet. It's in great shape. As I mentioned, our earliest debt maturity is in 2021; we've got billions in liquidity Our interest coverage for third quarter is 6.1 times. So we're very pleased with the balance sheet.", "And again, you don't have to take my word for it. Both the rating agencies just ratified in the last two weeks Range's credit rating. That's not the case for many other companies out there. And you look at where our bonds trade, very tight spread to treasuries. Our 2025s are trading below 400. That's kind of investment grade land. So we couldn't be happier with our current balance sheet and look forward to managing that leverage as we go forward.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And I would just add to it a little bit. When you look into the fourth quarter and first quarter specifically, in terms of netbacks, we think netbacks will get specifically significantly better, maybe on the order of 50% better. I think there's some numbers in the release you can look at or you can follow with the IR team for modeling. That's a combination of new projects starting up for us that result in better netbacks in pricing on the natural gas side as well as seasonality.", "Coupled with that we think with Mariner East being fully up and running, those real low propane quarters that we had, we've probably seen the low there as well with Mariner East enabling one, lower transportation costs and therefore better netbacks, but also the opportunity potentially for better pricing by having the optionality of either selling in the Northeast markets when they're good or being able to export in a much more efficient way.", "Dan E. McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Got it. Many thanks. Have a great day.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Good morning. Ray, on the dry gas pad you highlighted the five wells that had a 4 Bcf per 1,000-foot. Those obviously were over 8,000-foot laterals. Is that kind of the plan going forward compared to your type curve of 2.5 Bs per well? I'm just trying to get a sense as to, is that the new normal?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, actually that five-well pad, Ron, was a wet area pad. I think I said that in my notes. I hope I did. But there was a five-well dry pad that I talked about with the new IPs that we just brought online, and then the five-well pad that has a significant amount of history, because we talked about it almost a year ago when it came online, we're pretty confident in those EURs. It fit our modeling. We've got lots of offset history and reservoir models built all around it. So we're very confident in that 4 Bcf. They were about 8,100-foot laterals I think or so.", "And to answer your question further, yes. We do expect to drill. The team is actively trying to drill longer and longer laterals as we go forward. This year the average of the wells that we're putting to sales is about 6,000-foot all across the Marcellus. Clearly, there's some that are much, much longer. And clearly, there's some that are still shorter. But the average is 6,000 feet. Next year, we see that average approaching 7,000 feet. And I do believe, in a couple of years past that, you'll see us averaging close to 8,000 feet, more than likely. And I do think that the super rich area of the wet and dry and then the dry Northeast PA, that we may \u2013 we'll zero in on what those optimal lateral lengths are. But I do expect that they'll be different in different areas for a lot of different physical and reservoir reasons.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "But it seems even on the 1,000 foot, you're right, I did misspeak. But that 4 Bcf is versus almost 3Bs in the wet gas, that some of the changes you're making beyond lateral length is also on the efficiency side where it looks like the EURs per 1,000 foot are potentially biased higher as well?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Oh yeah. Yeah. Agreed. I mean, in addition to drilling longer laterals, we're still optimizing our frac designs. We're still looking at what's the optimal landing target and the optimal spacing between the clusters of perforations. And, yeah, we're looking at all sorts of proppant size mixes and proppant types and different things that we're looking at. So yes. You're exactly right. We do expect that our EUR per 1,000, you could be seeing increase somewhat. And we'll do that in a normal process that we do each year, and it's usually around the end of year where we update those economics. And I don't know if Alan wants to \u2013 Alan's in here, who really runs that effort for us and he can say a few words about that.", "Alan W. Farquharson - Senior VP-Reservoir Engineering & Economics", "Sure. Yeah. I think that, as Ray mentioned, our knowledge base continues to improve and that we're going to continue to see the efficiencies going forward. And that was kind of part of the whole thought process. As you get into these plays, you continue to understand what you have going forward, and we continue to expect to see improved well performance as we finish up 2015 and get into 2016. A little bit early to say exactly what we're going to come up with, type curves for 2016. We'll obviously update everyone in February on that.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Great. Given the time, I'll let someone else jump in. Thanks, guys.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Ron.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Ron.", "Operator", "The next question is from Paul Grigel with Macquarie.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. On 2016, realizing the budget process is still going on, but with the recent pullback in natural gas prices, how should we think about the focus on spending in the dry gas areas versus the wet gas versus Northeast, Southwest, North, just kind of across the Marcellus asset base?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. This is Ray. Paul, that's a great question. And I think you'll see us proceed forward just like we always have. We have a very disciplined capital allocation process. And we look AFEs throughout the year on a real-time basis, every AFE above a couple hundred thousand bucks has to go through Roger, myself, and Jeff. So we get to look and see what real-time is happening in the market, and with that we will have some flexibility to be able to adjust throughout the year, just like you've seen us do this year, from the original budget process to what we finally arrived at in January. You saw us change our capital allocation and begin to change our mix towards dry.", "As it stands today, clearly our dry gas economics are still better, and you'll see us continue to push a little bit more that way. That does not mean we're walking away from the liquids, by any means, because the returns there are still good, and we do still need to build infrastructure and do the things that we're doing over there. But I do think you'll see our mix move more towards dry going into 2016 also.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. And then just shifting \u2013 a follow up on the Utica. On the second well, is there any broad indication on how much higher that EUR may be than the first?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, that's a great question. And let me preface it by saying this is all really early in the play. There's only, in Southwest Pennsylvania, about five or so wells that have any history at all. I think ours is, clearly, our first well is about nine months now. The wells after that, I think about the longest well after that is maybe getting close to 90 days. And then after that, some of them haven't really even been to sales yet. And so this is really, really early on.", "But we feel pretty confident in our well. We've got nine months of production history. We've built some very extensive reservoir modellings that have 3D information in the reservoir; they have 3D modelling of the fracs that we've performed on the well. We've done a lot of research and diagnostics. When we look across the entire play, including the stuff in Ohio, it's one of the top 10 wells as it stands today on an absolute basis and on a per-thousand-foot basis. So we're really pleased with it.", "And all we can say today is the first well has about 60 days, and clearly, it's way too early to start talk about the second well. I'm sorry, I may have said the first well; the first well has about nine months, the second well has about 60 days, and clearly it's too early to talk about an EUR for it. But we can say, with some confidence, that it is better than the first well. So clearly we're really pleased with our first two wells. The offset wells, hats off to EQT and CNX, great wells. There's no question about it. But I think they're really, really early. And I think this play is going to need some more time. Our third well we'll complete sometime early next year and look at that.", "But this is a different kind of play; it's a Point Pleasant that we're really targeting. It's a carbonate, it's not a shale. Clearly, the faults and the fracture networks play a role in this. So I think there's a lot yet to be determined about how this play develops. And while it looks very promising to us, and we're excited that it can be a very complementary play, it's something that we can do \u2013 it's another lever we can push going down the road if we want to build some dry gas growth.", "But like Jeff said earlier, I think at this point we're going to sit back, we're going to watch these three wells. We're going to watch the offset activity that's around us, because the other important thing that I didn't mention about the five wells in Pennsylvania is they basically ring our acreage. They outline our positions, which is really great. So we're going to sit back and watch all of that. Then I think as we go into 2017, I think we'll have a much better idea of how we see that development plan going forward.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. Great. Then just one quick question on the quoted well costs. Does that include any science or is that just straight D&C cost?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. The $15.9 million for the third well includes facilities, which is very important. I think you need to be sure to be apples-to-apples when you're looking at those. It includes diagnostics. It's got a significant amount of diagnostics and science still in it. And then, of course, it's got some new technology, namely, the biggest one is the managed pressure drilling equipment.", "Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay.", "Operator", "We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Subash Chandra with Guggenheim Securities for our final question.", "Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thanks for fitting me in. The first question is on the NGL ex force (46:15). Just curious how you gauge a sentiment or an end user appetite from Europe. And just on some headlines we've seen from one of your customers, Eneos, if you see this as cooperative or competitive in that they got shale leases, they hired Mitchell people and buying gas properties out there? If you see that as sort of a stepping stone to broader exports or something that might stunt exports over time?", "Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development", "Well, yeah. Subash, this is Chad Stephens. Thanks for the question. So from Range's perspective, we think for our NGL prices, realized prices, and especially propane, we think the worst behind us. Mariner East gives us a lot of optionality. We can use seasonality on the East Coast, seasonality demand on the East Coast. We can put the propane on the water and focus on best prices, whether it be into Europe, or Asia or South America.", "We have a new \u2013 we'll talk about it, we'll have our IR team talk about it more \u2013 but we have a new contractual relationship with a global trader that has deep understandings of all the international markets and have relationships with Asian propane buyers and European propane buyers. They have a deep understanding of shipping and logistics. We're real excited about that. It's something we just actually inked \u2013 the ink is not even dry on the agreements, but it will give us what you're talking about, understanding of the buyers on the demand side, whether it be in Europe or in Asia. So we're excited about Mariner East. We're excited about this new relationship we have with this global trader.", "Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "That's good to know. And a quick geology question here, so Utica versus Marcellus, I guess I get the producibility questions, carbonate versus something that's probably not, but from a Bcf per 1,000, I'm just trying to understand why the Utica, given the pressures and the organic content of the Utica source rock into the Point Pleasant, why just naturally wouldn't have more gas in place than the Marcellus?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I think \u2013 I'm not a geologist, let me start by qualifying that. I'm a frack guy. But if you look at our map on page 15 in the presentation, and we've got some maps further back in the presentation, and you look at gas in place, these maps have been out there for some time. There's a lot of penetrations. There's a lot of offset activity. There's of course hundreds, and hundreds and hundreds of wells in Ohio that have all gone together to put this map. And I think it's pretty consistent against \u2013 through all of our peers and Southwest PA and in Ohio that everybody agrees with the map.", "About the best gas in place numbers that you see are around 100 Bcf. Now there might be some isolated areas that are closer to 150 Bcf per square mile. If you look at the Marcellus, it's about the same, if not higher in some cases. So I think it is what it is. The rock rules. I don't know that being in carbonate versus a shale would have any bearing on how much gas in place it has. It's going to be more things like total organic carbon content, victronite reflectants, and permeability, porosity and pressure plays a big role. Overburdened stresses determine how it drills and how it fracs. All of those things play big, big roles in how these wells produce and how they basically develop going forward. So I think the Point Pleasant, which is what we're all targeting, is a carbonate. It is not a shale.", "In the shales, you tend to have some component of desorption of gas from the clays that are present there. Clearly, there may be a little bit of that in the Point Pleasant, but we're way, way early. We clearly don't understand it. It does appear in the Point Pleasant that this data comes from core lab consortiums that were all participating in where we donate cores and then we all share in the analysis and the data. That the Point Pleasant does have some pressure-dependent perm challenges. So that's why you're hearing about choke management programs and managing the near-wellbore pressure drawdowns and so forth.", "And I think every operator is handling that a little bit different. But I think, as time goes on, we'll all zero in on what the best way to approach that is and go forward. But I think you still can't get past what Mother Nature put there, and the fact that the rock rules. And what we all know at this point is that Bcf per square mile is what it is. And I think how you go about getting that out is going to be the key going forward.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And let me weigh in as a reservoir engineer. And that's my background, coming up through petroleum engineering. The other thing that really is critical is long-term performance. So what's important to me is the fact that the oldest Marcellus well now, come this fall, which is our well, will have 11 years' worth of history, or 11 years since the discovery, 10 years' worth of history, but on thousands of wells in the Marcellus.", "So you have a largely low-risk play. So when we say we have wells in the Marcellus that are, if you look on page 11, that are 17, 17.6 Bs that cost $6 million, we have a high degree of confidence that's what it is. And those are strong numbers. The Utica may be great, time will tell. But ultimately it's a long-term performance of not just one well or two wells or 10 wells, but across a large data set that dictates what the economics of the play will be.", "Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We believe that we have the most capital-efficient growth, that we will have the most capital-efficient growth for 2015 and 2016 versus any of our Appalachian peers on a corporate basis. Importantly, with our 1.6 million acres of stacked pay potential in the core of the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian, we have the option to drill dry, wet gas or super rich acreage. Since about 900,000 net acres are dry and the rest is split between wet and super rich, in essence this gives us a portfolio within a portfolio.", "Coupling this resource base with our capital discipline and diversified marketing arrangements, which gives us multiple options that our competitors do not have, Range is positioned to create value as we move forward into an expected better market that more effectively balances supply, demand and infrastructure capabilities.", "Thanks for participating on the call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Statements contained in this conference call that are historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rodney Waller, Senior Vice President of Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rodney L. Waller - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator and good morning and welcome. Range reported results for the fourth quarter and the full quarter for calendar year of 2015 with record production, a continuing decrease in unit costs, significant proved reserve additions, and possibly the lowest drill-bit finding cost for 2015 of $0.37 per Mcfe. The speakers on the call today are Jeff Ventura, our CEO; Roger Manny, Range's CFO; and Ray Walker, our Chief Operating Officer.", "Range did file our 10-K with the SEC yesterday. It should be available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. In addition, we have posted on our website supplemental tables, which will guide you in the calculation of the non-GAAP measures of cash flow, EBITDAX, cash margins, unit costs per Mcfe and the reconciliation of reported earnings to adjusted non-GAAP earnings that are discussed on the call today.", "Now, let me turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Rodney. Given the challenging price environment, our capital spending budget for 2016 is projected to be $495 million. This will in essence result in two horizontal drilling rigs plus one air rig in Southwest Pennsylvania. And to put that in perspective, we entered 2015 with 15 rigs. So for 2016, we have significantly reduced our activity and are primarily focused in Southwest Pennsylvania. This year, we're projecting lower well costs, better marketing contracts and lower unit costs. This strategy generates good returns and preserves our efficiencies by keeping a minimal level of activity.", "Concerning asset sales, we have a signed purchase and sale agreement for Bradford County assets for $112 million. Our assets there consist of approximately $20 million per day of net production and about 11,000 net acres which is all operated by Repsol. This is our only outside operated position in the Marcellus.", "In addition, we're currently marketing our Central Oklahoma assets. It's also important to note and point out that we have approximately $1.3 billion of liquidity with no bond maturities due until 2021. For 2016, we have approximately 80% of our natural gas hedged at a floor of $3.24 Mcf. Unit costs are projected to continue to decrease into 2016 with the proceeds from our Virginia asset sales used to reduce debt by 24%, our interest expense per Mcfe should be lower in 2016 than 2015.", "Our Virginia assets also had higher LOE per Mcfe as well as higher G&A and broker gas marketing expense. Given the sale of our Virginia assets last year, coupled with the closing of our Oklahoma City office, staff reductions in our field offices last year and a recent workforce reduction in our Pittsburgh area offices and Fort Worth office. Our head count today is 31% lower than it was this time last year. Bottom line, we're projecting that on an absolute basis, interest expense, LOE and G&A will decline year-over-year.", "As you'll see from the release, transportation and gathering per Mcfe will increase, but given the better contracts and better price realizations, we're expecting improvement netback pricing.", "The Mariner East pipeline is expected to result in better netbacks for both ethane and propane. Range is the only producer on Mariner East. We control a dominant portion of the capacity on the pipe and has considerable access for propane cavern storage. With our unique contracts, we expect to generate significant pricing differentiation for these products going forward, especially during the summer of 2016. Given a full year of Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City transportation and better basis for a gas which we have locked in a significant portion with hedging, we're expecting better natural gas netbacks to more than offset the increase.", "As an example, this project contributed to our $0.41 per Mcf price differential improvement in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. Our IR team has given more color for 2016 in our release. The capital efficiencies our team is achieving are very significant. This is particularly impactful when efficiencies are combined with the quality of the rock that we have. We believe this is one of the key differentiating investment attributes of Range. We believe Range has the highest expected EUR recoveries on a per lateral foot in the Southwest portion of the Marcellus play combined with the lowest cost per lateral foot.", "What's important is that we're drilling laterals that are up to 1,000 feet longer with significantly lower cost ranging from 14% to 20% less total well cost per lateral foot including facilities. The EURs of these wells average 2.4 Bcf per 1,000 foot up to 3 Bcf per 1,000 foot. The absolute EURs are 16 Bcfe to 21 Bcf per well. Remember, we do have wells that are significantly higher than the average is. What's important is that the EURs per 1,000 foot of lateral are holding constant and we're achieving that performance in less time and with less cost resulting in improved capital efficiency.", "Lastly, I will summarize our reserve report for year-end 2015 that was released last night. Adjusting for asset sales last year, our reserves increased from year-end 2014. The drill-bit finding costs with provisions was $0.37 per Mcfe and our drill-bit replacement 436% or production including price and performance revision.", "Proved developed reserves increased from 52% to 55% and Marcellus reserves compose 97% of the total. Although the SEC proved reserve net present value decreased due to the significant commodity price decrease year-over-year. The year-end 2015 PV10 value of the proved reserves using future strip prices and current sales contracts is $6.8 billion which is very comparable to the year-end 2014 value of $6.9 billion.", "The continuing strong PV10 value is a result of continued capital efficiencies, reduced operating cost and improvement in netback pricing with the commencement of our most recent sales contracts and scheduled future contracts.", "For further comments on unit cost reductions as well as the balance sheet, I'll now turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you Jeff. The fourth quarter capped a year of solid operating progress. Range achieved consistent production growth with improved capital efficiency paired with significantly lower unit costs. Perhaps most importantly, for the second year in the row, we ended the year with lower debt than we started. Over the past two years, production has increased 48% while debt has been reduced by approximately $0.5 billion or 14%. Starting with the fourth quarter income statement, higher production and lower costs were no match for significantly lower year-over-year commodity prices.", "There were some bright spots, however. Cash margin during the fourth quarter was $1.52 an Mcfe, approximately 20% higher than the previous two quarters of this year. And both EBITDAX and cash flow were higher in the fourth quarter than the two preceding quarters of this year.", "Fourth quarter reported net loss was $322 million, driven by a $409 million pre-tax loss on sale of assets and an $88 million pre-tax impairment of legacy Midcontinent proved reserves. Fourth quarter earnings, calculated using analyst methodology which eliminates non-cash and non-recurring entries, was $42 million or $0.25 per fully diluted share.", "Cash flow for the fourth quarter was $204 million and EBITDAX was $241 million, both slightly more than 20% below last year's fourth quarter figures due to 30% all-in lower realized prices. Fourth quarter cash flow per fully diluted share was $1.22. Cash flow and EBITDAX for the full-year 2015 was $740 million and $897 million respectively. Cash flow per fully diluted share for the full-year 2015 was $4.45.", "There were a few unusual fourth quarter expense items that merit comment. And while most all expense categories came in at/or below guidance, transportation gathering and compression expense was $0.05 over guidance at $0.85 due to some new capacity coming on earlier than expected. Direct operating expense came in at $0.22, $0.06 under guidance, mainly due to a non-recurring $0.03 credit.", "Speaking of unusual and non-recurring items, just to give everyone a heads up, next week, we will be filing a registration statement to exchange our 4.875% senior notes issued last year under Rule 144A with lifetime registered notes. We're also registering some shares that are already issued and in the deferred compensation plan. This is an ordinary course of business administrative matter and it's being done immediately after the 10-K filing just to save accounting expense. There are no changes to the note terms.", "Our fourth quarter earnings release contains detailed expense item guidance for the first quarter of 2016 and one item that you'll note in the guidance is the increase in projected gathering transportation and compression expense associated with commencement of the Mariner East project. As further discussed in the earnings release and as evidenced in our fourth quarter margin improvement from the Uniontown to Gas City pipeline, these new projects are expected to improve our margins by generating significantly higher revenue over the incremental cost.", "Another item of note in the earnings release is our decision to conserve cash by reducing our cash common stock dividend by half from a quarterly $0.04 a share to $0.02 a share. A highlight of every year's fourth quarter release is the annual reset of our DD&A rate reflecting the results of the year-end audited proved reserve report.", "With heightened focus on capital efficiency, this year's results are especially significant. Our fourth quarter DD&A rate dropped to $0.97 per Mcfe, moving closer to our finding and development cost. With our total company recurring direct operating expense of approximately $0.26, the combined cost to recover our asset depreciation and produce our oil and gas was $1.23 an Mcfe. Our dry gas Marcellus assets have an even lower DD&A rate and direct operating expense. But even using this $1.23 per Mcfe figure for the whole company, as recently as 2009, our combined total company DD&A rate and direct operating expense was $3.17, almost three times today's figure.", "In the first quarter of last year, we closed our Oklahoma City office, which reduced our company-wide head count by approximately 8%. As Jeff mentioned, walking that event forward to today, asset sales and additional reductions in force have reduced our total head count by 31%.", "While this has been extraordinarily difficult for an already lean organization, it demonstrates our commitment to do what it takes to not just survive in the current downturn but effectively position the company for the future, whatever lies ahead.", "Because our realized price peaked in 2008, we are already over seven years into a period that many are just now calling lower-for-longer. We already know what that phrase means, and we know what that phrase means we have to do. Besides dramatically reducing head count and high-grading our assets, here's another illustration of the type of positioning for the future I'm referring to.", "In our reserves release, you'll see that we have a $0.40 per Mcfe proved undeveloped conversion cost, a modest 0.4 well proved undeveloped/proved developed producing booking ratio, meaning that for every PDP Marcellus well, we'd only have 0.4 PUD wells offset booked. And you'll note that our PUD reserves are limited, not by economic value but by the SEC five-year rule.", "Now, not mentioned in the release is that we have 124 fully constructed and operational Marcellus drilling pads holding five or fewer wells with, in most cases, room to drill up to 18 wells or more on each pad. Now, this means that for every PUD well we convert to a PDP well, there is another one ready to book on an existing pad with already built-out infrastructure.", "With 124 lightly drilled pads already constructed and tied in, we can economically grow reserves in production in this fashion for many years. Plus, we have another 59 pads with six to nine wells on them, and these pads have the same lower-for-longer economics. We've included in the supplemental tables posted to the website a slide which takes the economics behind this illustration full cycle.", "Starting with our actual fourth quarter 2015 $1.66 per Mcfe total cash cost, then adding the $0.40 F&D cost, then adding our fourth quarter $0.35 an Mcfe basis differential, it totals to a basis adjusted all-in cost of $2.41 an Mcfe, which generates excellent margins against our $3.24 2006 hedged floor price. But more importantly, this current all-in cost figure is more than covered by current strip prices in 2017 and beyond.", "If things get even more challenging, note that the $0.40 F&D cost number in the reserve report is an average across all the company's proved undeveloped locations. Actual F&D cost will vary by well type and location, and we have the option to select from 183 existing pad sites, allowing us to optimize the development activity to match market conditions. Now, Ray is going to unpack this illustration a bit more during his remarks in just a few moments.", "Now, positioning Range for 2017 with a recycle ratio over one times, unhedged at current strip prices, gives us confidence that we can continue to grow within cash flow even in this challenging environment. We believe that an underappreciated key metric to balance sheet preservation lies not in the rearward looking balance sheet ratio debt-to-EBITDAX, but in a forward-looking income statement ratio like the unhedged recycle ratio. If your unhedged recycle ratio isn't above one times, reducing debt or stockpiling cash only buys you time, it doesn't buy you success. This doesn't mean that we're ignoring the balance sheet, however.", "At year-end 2015, our bank credit facility balance outstanding was $95 million. That's down from $723 million at year-end 2014. We've got approximately $1.3 billion in current available liquidity. Our earliest bond maturities, as Jeff mentioned, is 2021. The weighted average interest rate on our bonds is 5.125% and our debt is 96% fixed.", "We have class-leading asset coverage with total debt per Mcfe of proved reserves of $0.23. And though we do not have a debt-to-EBITDAX ratio covenant, our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio at year-end 2015 was a very respectable and manageable 3.0 times. Lastly, our bonds continue to trade well against our peer group before and after recent rating agency actions.", "Range currently has approximately 80% of our estimated 2016 gas production hedged at a floor price of $3.24 an Mmbtu. The earnings release contains a summary of our hedge positions for all commodities of 2016 and 2017. Additional more detailed hedged volumes and prices can be found on our website.", "In summary, though our realized commodity price has declined every year since 2008, 2015 was the first year where Range was unable to increase cash flow and cash flow per share through higher production and lower costs. And while some may say this signals the bottom and better times are ahead, we've aggressively responded to the 2015 cash flow decrease by reducing and optimizing growth, carefully deploying capital to our best return wells, shedding additional non-core assets, further lowering our cost structure, improving our capital efficiency, having our dividend, protecting our liquidity, and continuing to operate safely in an environmentally sound manner. Much has been accomplished in 2015 and there is much left to do, but we're confident in the future of Range and we're going to manage our finances accordingly.", "Ray over to you.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Roger. In 2015, we spent $814 million on drilling and completion which was 40% lower than the previous year and it resulted in 20% year-over-year growth even though the Mariner East project was delayed significantly from the original plan. This was a real testament to our team coupled with our high-quality and diverse asset base, meaning dry or liquids rich, and what we believe our best-in-class capital efficiencies.", "Focusing on Southwest Pennsylvania for a few highlights from 2015 as compared to 2014, we saw our drilling costs per foot of lateral decreased by 21% while drilling 24% longer laterals. Our completions team increased the number of frac stages per frac crew per day by 31%. We achieved a 15% reduction in water costs for our completions operations. And with operational efficiencies and service cost reductions, we recognized an average 33% decrease in total completion costs per well. And importantly, we expect these improvements to continue.", "For this year, our total capital budget is $495 million. This plan represents a 45% reduction in total capital from 2015 and a 69% reduction from 2014. Of that capital, 96% is directed towards drilling and completion with only $20 million in land. Essentially, all of our capital is directed towards the Marcellus with the majority of that being spent in Southwest PA.", "And you can find the details for all of that in our earnings release and in our updated presentation on the website. We're only spending about $18 million in Northeast PA this year which involves 14 wells coming online and a couple of wells drilled which will be completed later. Our fourth quarter production came in at 1.43 Bcf equivalent per day, slightly exceeding our guidance of 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day. And our annual growth was right at 20% as forecasted.", "Production for the entire 2016 year is expected to average 1.39 Bcf equivalent per day to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day with 30% to 35% liquids. This works out to 8% to 10% production growth for the year on a pro forma basis adjusted for asset sales. Production for the first quarter of 2016 is expected to be approximately 1.35 Bcf equivalent per day with 30% to 32% liquids. This guidance accounts for the sale of the Virginia properties of $107 million a day on a pro forma basis. And on the pro forma basis would represent a 2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2015.", "Importantly, we expect to see a higher exit rate at the end of 2016 than we stated the year with after the asset sale. We'll also maintain an inventory of wells waiting on completion or tie-in that is consistent with our reduced activity levels and also consistent with past years. This should set us up well going into 2017.", "Jeff touched on the longer laterals, lower cost and resulting capital efficiencies in his remarks, and you can find the details and the economics behind those in our updated presentation. And Roger talked about the fact that we have an inventory of pads all across the core of the core with a demonstrated ability to drill wells with substantially less cost per well, so let me take a minute and walk through our three areas in the Marcellus and Southwest Pennsylvania and work all of this in together.", "First, we've updated our 500-foot spacing test and our infill test in our updated presentation on pages 40 and 41. Our tighter spacing projects now have almost six years of history and our infill project now has almost two years of data on the new infill wells. Both demonstrate success in our core acreage position in Southwest Pennsylvania, and we believe this is a distinct and unique advantage for Range.", "In the super-rich area, the 2016 wells are planned to average 6,700 feet which will be 24% longer than last year yet with the improved efficiencies and cost savings the completed well cost will be about the same which is $5.9 million.", "Now, I want to take a second here and remind everyone that all of the costs that we discussed here are total completed well costs and do include all the facilities. We're projecting the 2016 super-rich wells to cost $881 per foot of lateral which is a 20% improvement over 2015. We project the recoveries to be 2.4 Bcf equivalent per 1,000 foot of lateral.", "Said another way, we project spending $5.9 million to recover 16 Bcf equivalent, which equates to an F&D cost of $0.44 per Mcfe. Following, Roger's earlier point, if these wells were drilled on existing pads utilizing already existing infrastructure including the pad, roads, facilities, water and so forth, the total well cost would be significantly less and the F&D cost could then be as low as $0.38 per Mcfe.", "In the wet area, our 2016 wells are projected to have 7,000 foot laterals on average which is 17% longer than 2015. Given the increased efficiencies and lower costs, the wet area wells are expected to cost $5.8 million or $832 per foot of lateral which is a 16% improvement over 2015. These wells are projected to recover 3 Bcf equivalent per 1,000 foot.", "Again to summarize, we project spending $5.8 million to recover 21 Bcf equivalent which equals an F&D cost of $0.34 per Mcfe. Again if these wells were drilled on existing pad, the F&D costs could be as low as $0.29 per Mcfe. The Southwest dry area wells in 2016 are expected to average slightly longer at 7,000 feet versus 6,800 feet last year.", "Significantly, the cost is projected to decrease from $6 million to $5.2 million. That's $743 per foot of lateral which is a 14% improvement over 2015. Again, our projected recovery of 17.6 Bcf for $5.2 million in the dry area equals an F&D cost of just $0.36 per Mcfe. If drilled on existing pads, the F&D cost could be as low as $0.27 per Mcfe.", "In summary, by drilling on existing pads, our F&D cost in Southwest Pennsylvania could be in the range of $0.26 to $0.34 per Mcfe, which we believe would be the lowest in the play. As capital efficiency continues to improve throughout this year and beyond, we believe these F&D costs could go even lower, maybe as much as 10% lower, resulting in higher margins and even better recycle ratio for the company.", "Our inventory of existing pads on core acreage coupled with our continued improvement in capital efficiency and our low-cost structure give us a significant advantage in this low-price environment. It positions us well for 2017, and we don't believe this is the case for everyone.", "Capital efficiency is our focus and we're recognizing it in many ways. For example, in looking at our current plan for 2016, we're putting on line almost the same number of frac stages or if you say it another way, approximately the same amount of lateral feet for 43% less capital than we did last year while maintaining some of the highest EURs per 1,000 foot recoveries in the basin.", "We can do this because of the high-quality resource and plays that Range has captured over the past 11 years of development in its core position. We believe these achievements are not likely outside the core, and we believe they are unique to Range.", "Along with improving efficiencies from 15% longer laterals, we're continuing to achieve decreases in service costs this year as compared to last year. Our operating efficiency is among the best in the basin, and we have no long-term commitments for services. As an example, on the completions front, we're averaging over seven frac stages per day, per crew resulting in some very attractive service pricing for Range while still generating acceptable margins for the service companies. We believe this provides another unique advantage for Range.", "On the marketing side, Range has added some capacity over the last four months that we're really excited about and that we've been discussing for quite some time. Of course, with this capacity comes cost. The biggest driver of the increase in transport expense for 2016 is related to Mariner East coming online in the first quarter as well as additional ATEX capacity for ethane.", "Mariner East is expected to bring us better netbacks on our 20,000 barrels per day of ethane and 20,000 barrels per day of propane. The project started the commissioning process for ethane in late 2015, commissioned the refrigeration system in January then Range introduced ethane into the pipeline for the first time in February and we expect to be loading the first ethane ship in a few days.", "We'll begin shipping ethane to INEOS and we'll also be able to utilize VLGCs which are the largest ships available to ship propane while providing lower cost transportation and better netbacks. As a result, NGL realizations are expected to improve from approximately 18% in 2015 to 24% in 2016. And NGL volumes increase substantially, approximately 30% over 2015. The resulting increased revenue far exceeds the additional NGL transport expense, thus improving cash flow.", "On the gas front, we had a full quarter of the pipeline project Uniontown to Gas City by Spectra Energy. We'll have a full year of this for 2016 and this capacity is part of the reason for the improvement in our natural gas differentials when looking at the fourth quarter versus the third quarter or when looking at 2016 versus 2015. This project allows us access to markets in the Midwest and achieves pricing that is better than NYMEX.", "Fourth quarter 2015 natural gas differentials were $0.41 better than the third quarter, and full-year 2016 is expected to be $0.10 better than full-year 2015 differentials. These premium transport additions set us up well to improve our relative pricing for 2016 and beyond for both NGLs and natural gas.", "Next, I would like to bring you up to speed on our Utica wells. We're currently completing our third well as we speak. It's a 5,800 foot lateral completed with 38 frac stages averaging 500,000 pounds of profit per stage which is 50/50 100-mesh and premium 40/70. The well will be flowed back, tested and put on production under a managed pressure program, and we will not be trying to achieve a headline rate. The well is currently forecast to come in around $17 million including the production facilities.", "We're currently cleaning up the well for the initial flow back and then we'll be building production facilities, planning to turn the well to sales prior to the end of the second quarter. We believe that our next well's total cost, again including all the production facilities, would be in the range of $12 million for a 6,500 foot lateral. And we estimate a well with an 8,000 foot lateral would come in at approximately $14 million.", "The EUR of our first well remains in the range of 15 Bcf gross, and the second well is still expected to better than that. We're encouraged by these early results, and we see potential for further enhancements both in cost and in performance. However, in looking at the cost per thousand foot of lateral even on the next wells, we're in the $1.8 million range as compared to $743,000 in our Southwest PA dry Marcellus acreage.", "In simpler terms, the Utica costs almost 2.5 times more than our dry Marcellus while achieving about the same production. While the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential even with anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells far exceed the Utica. Given limited production history thus far, on a risk-adjusted basis, it's clear that our high-quality Marcellus wells are the superior investment.", "Over time, we expect that the Utica can be a complementary development opportunity. But for now, our plan for the rest of this year is to monitor these wells along with offset wells while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine a path forward from there. In the meantime, we will remain focused on our high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible, and we'll continue to work to lower cost and improve capital efficiency.", "Now, back to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Ventura. Our first question comes from the line of Jon Wolff with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "A few here. You may have been asked this before, but you obviously got a great price for Nora, but can you talk about what that does to your natural decline rate?", "Alan W. Farquharson - Senior VP-Reservoir Engineering & Economics", "Yeah, Jon. This is Alan Farquharson. Our decline rate still stays relatively consistent with what it's been historically. The reason why the Marcellus has been such a dominant producer in terms of total production, if you think about it, last year we made about 1.4 Bcfe a day and Nora was 100 million, just using some round numbers.", "So the decline rate first full year still is around 19% and then declines. Within five years, you're back under 10% again. So that's pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last year. I think that a lot of people haven't really recognized how shallow the decline is in the Marcellus overall.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "A little more granular on that. I mean, it's such a low number, given \u2013 without the tight gas sands of the past and without Nora. Would that be a testament to the sort of average age of wells because certainly first year declines are not anywhere near 20%?", "Alan W. Farquharson - Senior VP-Reservoir Engineering & Economics", "Yeah, I think it's a function a little bit of the average age of the wells, but I think it's also \u2013 the first year kind of declines fairly steeply in a lot of these shale plays. But then I think most people probably don't look at year two, three, four, and five and then you see how flat some of the declines are. If you look at a lot of the historical data that's out on the PA website, you can see that those wells get fairly flat, relatively flat relatively quickly.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think an important point to note is if you look at Range's reserves year-over-year for the last 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 years maybe, our reserve revisions have been positive almost every year and really that speaks to the quality of rock and the wells are continuing to outperform. Again, that's not something that I think happens everywhere, but the fact that we haven't had reserve cuts and in fact we've got positive revisions gives our management team great comfort as well as our banking group. So part of that is \u2013 and if the wells are outperforming by definition than the declines are shallower.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "And also I'll just add one more thing in, Jon. This is Ray. That I think if you look at our type curves that we updated in the presentation, you'll see that last year's production in a couple of those areas seems to be pretty flat and I think people don't realize, most of our wells come online under constrained conditions. So that first year decline that most people think is there is somewhat muted compared to a lot of other places. So I think that contributes to it also.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Just thinking about capital efficiency and the decade-long process of in-fill acreage drill, purchases and building pads which if you could remind me how much they cost? I think last year \u2013 one time you're in kind of single well pads and then more recently I think it was four to five or five to six per pad, wells per pad. Can you update us on that and also the cost of a well pad?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Jon. The pad construction phase or building a pad and a road can average anywhere from $400,000 up to $1 million depending on the terrain and the locale and whether it's got wet land streams next to it and all those sort of things that we have to do from erosion and sedimentation protections in Pennsylvania. So on average, $600,000 or so to $700,000 maybe. We have always drilled probably no fewer than three or four wells per pad, and in most cases, we average around five, I would guess. This is the current average. We can do some more research on that and see. But I think it's about five. We have drill pads up to 9 and 10 and 12 wells, but on average, it's about five.", "We have very few pads that are less than three or four anywhere from history. I mean, we had a few very far step-out pads early on that were one or two or three wells, but that's literally been maybe five, six, seven years ago.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me just add on to Ray a little bit. But like Ray and Roger were talking about, it really sets us up at this point for strong capital efficiency going forward and the optionality to go back to those pads and drill on those pads where you've got a lot of the costs already. And the team has done a great job. So going forward, there is a really built in capital efficiency, and I think it's a strong statement to say even in this environment. We have a recycle ratio greater than 1 by being able to...", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, unhedged.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Yeah. That was the context of the question. I just wanted to get some numbers around it. The other thing on limiting the number of wells per pad, if I recall in the past, talking to you, some of it had to do with the takeaway infrastructure that would be required if you went to seven or eight wells per pad. Obviously, you don't own your own midstream company and maybe that's some of the factor. But it feels like \u2013 is there right sizing that \u2013 in terms of the amount of takeaway capacity that colors your view of how many wells per pad at least on the initial phase, I know you plan to go back to well those pads later?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We'll kind of tag team the question. I think if you look at slide 18, that kind of tells the story. We have a huge acreage position and what we think is the core of the ploy. So early on, we're limiting the number of wells per pad to be able to drill more pads, to be able to hold that position. And by the end of this year, we're basically done with that. On slide 18, when you look at the \u2013 and at this point, it's really well delineated. We've got basically combined potential in those horizons of about 1.5 million net acres stacked, predominantly down in Southwest PA. So we spread \u2013 so, for limited capital, we spread those pads out to hold it, but now going forward, it really sets up a strong efficiency to go back and drill on those particular pads.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Right. And Jon, it's been literally a 10-year \u2013 9 or 10 year process of building infrastructure with MarkWest when you talk about the wet system for instance. And a lot of that is \u2013 the backbone of that system is finally in place. And I think another concept is when we go back to one of these pads, I don't think we'd be going back and drilling all 18 wells. We would go back and drill two, three, four wells to kind of fill in that room that's now available because of the natural decline of the system and so forth, plus the fact that, like Jeff said, we've been talking about for a couple of years now that we had targeted about 2017 when the HBP kind of factor would be almost gone, and we're literally on the precipice of that. So we can literally, starting in next year's plan, really focus on the highest returns and where there is room in the systems whether it's the dry systems in East Washington or the Allegheny County or in the wet system. We have that much flexibility and that diverse set of assets, like Jeff was referring to.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Last one since my mailbox is being inundated with the question around transport and gathering costs going up, and I assume that has a lot to do with Mariner East 1. I guess, my question is \u2013 I guess number one is, I think that's the big reason, but maybe confirm that. And then second, is propane at least getting a better revenue value than natural gas, and is there sort of a positive uplift from processing propane, understanding that these costs are fixed than some costs?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I'll start. I mean, yeah. I mean, you're right. The additional costs are mainly from Mariner East starting up. And so we have that cost that goes on that line and the transportation on it. But it results in netback pricing both propane and ethane, that's far better than anything we've got in the past, so it way more than offsets and then Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City is a good example. The transportation cost on that line also gets added, but then when you net-net it all out, we're selling gas for sometimes $1 better than what we're selling it in to, results in $0.40, $0.50, $0.60, sometimes up to $1 better netback price.", "But I'll turn it over to Chad to talk a little bit more about propane.", "Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development", "Yeah, Jon. This is Chad. We have worked on \u2013 since we moved the in-service date of Mariner East, we worked with the (43:09). I think we announced that we had a long-term agreement with (43:13). They have a global presence, and they are helping us and advising us on selling propane into the international markets. So since we announced the arrangement with them, we've locked in arb between mainly Europe and what Mont Belvieu prices were. So with that arb locked in for all of 2016 and part of 2017, we've captured that value that's much better than Mont Belvieu. So it's much better than Mont Belvieu and it's better than gas that we could get on a gas price equivalent basis.", "Of late, you've watched freight, the Baltic Index on freight costs come way down. This time last year they were about \u2013 equivalent of about $0.12 a gallon to $0.14 a gallon. You can currently get a freight rate Baltic Index quote of about $0.035 to $0.04 a gallon. So the freight rates have played into our hand as well. So we're at the end of the day going to be able to get \u2013 at Houston plant, we're going to be able to get a Mont Belvieu equivalent to maybe minus $1 or minus $2 which is much better than any of our peers. So we're excited about Mariner East coming fully in service where we can take advantage of loading VLGC ships, lots of volume which will lower our per unit cost of shipping.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "That helps. Thanks, guys.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning. Ray, from a timing standpoint and as you talked about capital efficiency, at what point do you think you'd go back and start to drill again on those pads and be able to leverage the prior expenditures on the pad construction?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, Ron, it's a good question. We, for the last couple of years, we always seem to have a small percentage of our wellbore going back in an area and doing that. I think this year, there's a pretty small percentage of the wells that are on existing pads. I think really going into next year, and of course, we're just announcing this year's plans, so we've got a lot of work to do to figure out exactly what we're going to do in 2017. But I do foresee us probably starting to make more of a move towards that in 2017.", "Of course, a lot of it depends on pricing and what all happens this year and I think with the big capital cuts that everybody is going through and the rig counts falling and lots of people choosing not even to drill per se that we're going to see the gas production roll over and we're clearly seeing gas demand increasing. So it's just a matter of time before things start changing and I think we're going to have to get much later in this year before we see how that works out and exactly what our numbers are going to look like for 2017.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "And I think part of it to go on one of the things that Jon mentioned was, from a infrastructure standpoint part of it, you never want to build capacity for peak production. And so when you look at your estimates of those pads, is the timing also driven by the fact when you start to gain capacity on some of those pads or is there something else driving that investment decision?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "No. You're absolutely right. I mean, one of the driving factors in that whole plan will be exactly where we can put these wells, where there's room in the compression for instance, and process and capacity and all the different things that go into that, the markets, it's all a very integrated multi-disciplinary process that we go through. And we'll literally be working all this year as we \u2013 and we constantly optimize what we're doing month by month even right now. So that's always a big impact. You're correct on that.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "And then lastly on just the NGL realizations, particularly related to Mariner East, is that something that begins to start up here at the very end of the first quarter, is it better just to model it beginning in the second quarter? And then associated, I think in the past you had talked about cash flows from the ability to access international markets or even local markets in the case of propane can generate an incremental $50 million or so of cash flow over a 12 month period. Do those numbers remain unchanged?", "Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development", "Yeah. This is Chad. We actually started taking our propane in kind in the fourth quarter of 2015. Mariner East was not fully in service. It was not fully refrigerated. So we still were loading on what's called handy ships, handy ships are smaller volumes, they can take about 150,000 barrels. So the per unit transportation cost is a little bit higher which our netbacks were not as good as with Mariner East fully in service, refrigeration is in service and we can load the VLGC ships.", "But our main focus on marketing the propane once it's fully in service is either take advantage of the arbs between Europe, Asia and Mont Belvieu and/or the local markets. We can sell into the local markets in, for instance, the winter months when propane prices spike if we get a polar vortex. So we have that optionality to be able to find the best price for the propane whatever time of year it is, if that makes sense", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "With the pricing throughout not flat, but it should have a smoothing impact on the prices through the year for NGLs, correct?", "Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development", "Yes.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Okay, perfect. That's all for me. Thank you.", "Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development", "And we're...", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.", "Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Roger, I know we share the same love of the recycle ratio and appreciate you putting that slide on the website. I wanted to ask you kind of on the three variables that you could control in that equation. One on the F&D side of things, you threw a $0.40 number out right now. But you really highlighted that you move to infrastructure, you move to dry gas area, that could potentially come down lower. Curious on activity levels, you've got 37% activity geared to the dry gas areas right now. Can you increase that more going forward given this best economics?", "And then the second part of it is just on the confluence of the differentials and the transport costs. You guys have shown out to 2017 more downward pressure on the gas differentials. Curious if you \u2013 on slide four, you throw your cost on the transport side out to 2016, curious what that could look like going out to 2017? Thanks.", "Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay, Mike. Yeah, let me comment on the recycle ratio and then I'll turn it over to Chad on the differentials. And you're exactly right, I share your enthusiasm for this ratio. I mean, we went through a period where in the old days F&D costs really mattered. And then we went through this period where everybody had oil and gas coming out of their ears and margins were great and then nobody really cared about it. It was all about margins. And now, I think, it's coming back into vogue and as it should be because, in times like this, positive recycle ratio unhedged, as I mentioned, I think is the key to keeping things afloat.", "The $0.40 number that we have in the slide that we posted, again, that's company average F&D just to convert the PUDs. My illustration was there that since you've taken about 1.2 Ts of PUDs that are economic off your books because of the five-year rule, to the extent you go back in there and pop a PUD and convert it on existing pad, you just move another well onto it to take its place.", "But the $0.40 covers all the PUDs booked across the entire company. And as Ray mentioned, in some of the areas of Marcellus like the dry gas, that number is down in the low $0.20s. So while the strip price is going to move and fluctuate, to your point, we can work the throttle and work that F&D cost as well. So that's a key variable for us.", "As for the 37% dry gas. I mean, we've got some infrastructure coming on on the dry gas gathering side that'll allow us to ramp that up going forward. But, again, those are kind of game-time decisions as we look across the portfolio. And Ray's team looks at having the optionality on 183 existing pads, do I want to drill a super-rich, do I want to drill a wet, do I want to drill dry. We have other contacts besides MarkWest in Southwest PA, so a lot of moving parts, a lot of variables, and it's just a matter of optimizing.", "So I think the key is having discovered the play and having been there for 11 years, that first-mover advantage of having just a whole lot more optionality in how we move forward in a tough environment.", "Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development", "So part of your question was discussing also future basis differential, and when you look at currently and going into 2016, Dominion South and M2 are still pretty much under pressure. But with some of these new projects, takeaway projects coming on line, the indexes are improving if you look at the forward curves of indexes. (53:17) in Dominion South improved a little bit but not that much, maybe going from $1 to $0.60 or $0.70.", "But specifically for Range, if you look at slide 15 in our presentation, it talks about our firm transportation takeaway in 2016 and 2017. And though it increases, it's part of the increase in our transportation and gathering when you look the cycle margins.", "It increases the cost, but also our basis differential improves, both in 2016 midpoint of around $0.42 and then going out into 2017 when some of other projects come into service, it improves even more, midpoint of about $0.28 to $0.30. So that's just helping the margins.", "Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "And then the final part of that, probably just a multifaceted question there, is the transport and gathering into 2017, $1.05 in 2016, what's kind of the trend there? Do you expect more upward pressure on that, or could it stay at that level?", "Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think it's going to be \u2013 it's going to move around a little bit, Mike, but it's \u2013 over time, again, I know we've said that, but as we continue to build out, that's going to plateau, and eventually it will move down as we start to fully maximize the capacity.", "But again, the big bump is incremental projects that produce incremental margin, incremental revenue. So we're not too upset about the increase that we had in the fourth quarter and that we've announced for the first quarter.", "Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Got it.", "Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development", "The real key on the transportation per unit cost is, as Ray and Roger have talked about, we're going to be putting more and more volumes on, but you're not going to be spending more dollars on gathering and compression. Therefore, your volumes are going to be able to lower that cost just with the volume changes.", "Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Okay. Ray, switch gears, just a quick one on the Oklahoma assets you have for sale. Can you give us the teaser on this? And just I'm curious how much exposure you've got to the STACK and SCOOP? Thanks.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "We've got BoA marketing it. It's about 28,000 net acres spread across four counties, about 6.5 million a day of production. The acreage is 100% HBP by all legacy vertical wells, about 6.5 million a day of production, about 80% of that is gas. It's right in the heart of the activity where Devon bought Felix's acreage and where Continental is drilling and Newfield is focused. So we will be receiving the bids soon. And we'll be evaluating the valuations and making a decision here probably by the end of March.", "Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I'd like to close with the announcement that Rodney Waller will be retiring this May. We pretty much appreciate Rodney's contributions over the years, and we wish Rodney the best in his retirement. Rodney has been a committed shareholder since 1988. He has built a strong team and Laith Sando has been promoted to continue as Vice President of Investor Relations. We have great confidence that Laith will do well in his new position and the team will continue to be responsive to your questions.", "Thanks for participating on the call.

This call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.", "Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risk and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.", "After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer period.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President of Investor Relations at Range Resource. Thank you, sir. You may begin.", "Laith Sando", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range\u2019s first quarter earnings call. The speakers on today\u2019s call are Jeffrey Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Chief Operating officer; and Roger Manny, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Hope you\u2019ve had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we\u2019ve posted on the Web site. We\u2019ll be referencing some of the new slides this morning.", "We also filed a 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It\u2019s available on our Web site under the Investors tab. Or you can access it using the SEC\u2019s Edgar system.", "Before we begin, let me also point out that we\u2019ll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. In addition, we posted supplemental tables on our Web site to assist in the calculation of these non-GAAP measures and to provide more details on both natural gas and NGL pricing.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Ventura", "Thank you, Ray. Since our last call, we continue to make progress on several fronts. On the marketing side, INEOS is now routinely picking up ethane at Marcus Hook and shipping it to Norway. At the same time, we are now loading propane on VLGCs and shipping it to various international markets. The ability to ship ethane and propane out of Marcus Hook is a significant competitive advantage for Range. As an E&P company, we\u2019re now able to connect a large percentage of our NGL production to end markets, the buyers and consumers.", "As represented in our guidance for 2016, it has a meaningful impact on both NGL production and pricing. Given our transportation contracts for 2017, approximately 70% of our natural gas is projected to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin, further improving Range\u2019s expected natural gas differentials going forward.", "By the end of 2017, we expect to increase the amount of natural gas to be sold outside of the Appalachian Basin to about 82% of production. On the asset sale front, we recently closed the sale of our Bradford County acreage in Northeast Pennsylvania. The sale price was approximately $112 million. This was our only non-operative position in the Marcellus.", "We have also recently signed a purchase and sale agreement for a southern acreage package in the stack play in Oklahoma. We have agreed to sell around 9,200 net acres and approximately 5 million cubic feet equivalent per day of net production from approximately 200 wells in Blaine, Canadian and Kingfisher Counties for about $77 million. We expect to close by the end of May. ", "The remaining northern acreage packages predominantly in Major County, Oklahoma consists of approximately 19,000 net acres and is on trend in north of the existing stack play and is in the emerging Osage play. Given that this play and other plays are moving in a direction of our position, we believe this acreage will increase in value with time and additional drilling results. Our plans will be to keep it for now since it's primarily HBP and we\u2019ll look at the possibility of selling it at a more opportune time in the future.", "Importantly, with these two asset sales of approximately $190 million, we expect no increase in absolute debt in 2016 as compared to year-end 2015 based on current pricing. This type of neutral budget preserves our balance sheet and liquidity, while allowing the macroenvironment time to improve.", "On the operations front, our team continues to optimize our development. We continue to improve both capital and operating efficiencies. Ray will discuss this and give some specific examples in his discussion. The Marcellus, specifically in Southwest Pennsylvania, will continue to be the focal point of our activity this year. As Ray will mention, we drilled some outstanding new wells and the performance of some of the older wells continues to impress.", "Our third dry Utica well is performing better than the first two wells and appears to be one of the top wells in the entire Utica play. It's great to have 400,000 net acres of dry Utica potential beneath our Marcellus acreage, which gives us options down the road. The deciding factor for Range will ultimately be what are the economics of the Utica versus the Marcellus. We will allocate capital to the wells with the best economics. And right now, that means our Southwest Pennsylvania Marcellus development.", "In 2016, we\u2019re projecting lower well cost, the impact of improved price realizations, better transportation capabilities, and lower all-in unit cost. The capital efficiencies our team is achieving are very significant. This is particularly impactful when efficiencies are combined with the quality of the rock we have.", "We believe this is one of the key differentiating investment attributes of Range and one of the reasons we\u2019re able to replace production so efficiently with maintenance CapEx of approximately $300 million or less. We believe Range has the highest expected EUR recoveries on a per lateral foot in the southwest portion of the Marcellus play combined with the lowest cost per lateral foot. ", "For 2015, our expected finding costs, using current development cost to recover pud reserves, was $0.40 per mcfe, significantly lower than the expectations of other natural gas producers. In the price environment the industry is facing today, the ability to develop reserves more efficiently is a key advantage for Range. Utilizing a finding cost of $0.40 or better, coupled with our projected 2016 all-in cash cost and looking at 2017 strip prices, our projected unhedged recycle ratio approaches 2. As Ray mentioned on his last call, in our best areas, our projected unhedged recycle ratio was over 2.", "In summary, the first quarter was meaningful for Range. We had a significant marketing project become operational. We\u2019ve got non-core assets sales that further high-grade our assets and keep debt unchanged at year-end, and we continue to see improving well results across our acreage in Southwest Pennsylvania, all of which sets up Range well for 2016 and into 2017.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations.", "Ray Walker", "Thanks, Jeff.", "What I\u2019ll do this morning is cover our production guidance, provide some examples of cost reduction and efficiency improvements, give some color on well performance, and talk about some of the potential opportunities that we see going forward.", "We continue to remain focused on capital allocation and our production growth is a result of high quality properties being developed by a strong technical team. Production for the first quarter came in at 1.38 Bcf equivalent per day with 33% liquids. And for the second quarter, we\u2019re setting guidance at 1.41 Bcf equivalent per day, with 32% to 35% liquids. Of note, during the second quarter, we expect to fully replace all the production sold from our three sales and our annual guidance moves to the high-end of our previous guidance and is now expected to be 1.41 to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day.", "We believe this year will look very similar to previous years with sequential quarterly growth and our exit rate will be higher than it was at the end of 2015, setting us up well for 2017.", "For the first quarter, we continued to drive down our overall unit cost, resulting in a reduction of 10% from the prior year's quarter. Basically, all of the categories beat guidance.", "One particular item that I would like to call your attention to is the LOE. Our operating teams continue to operate more efficiently. And when coupled with recent asset sales, our LOE per mcfe is 37% lower than a year ago and 14% lower than the prior quarter. ", "Capital efficiency continues to improve. I\u2019ll go through just a few examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. On the completions front, we completed 1,324 stages with 2.25 crews during the quarter, setting another record. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, with the same number of crews, this is a 28% improvement. March was a record month, with 526 stages. We averaged 7.1 stages per day per crew, which is an improvement of 9% from a year ago. And in spite of completing longer laterals, we completed 15% more wells in the quarter than a year ago.", "You\u2019ve seen our water costs dramatically improve as a result of logistics, planning and some creative new management tools, resulting in savings of over $350,000 per pad. These efficiency improvements resulted in a 31% reduction in total completion cost per foot of lateral compared to a year ago.", "On the drilling side, for the first quarter, we achieved a 20% reduction in drilling costs per foot as compared to last year, while drilling 50% more lateral feet per day per well on average. Said another way, we drilled 50% faster and saved 20% on our drilling costs.", "All of this helps us on two very significant fronts. First, we get better pricing from our service partners as they can count on very high utilization rates. While we don't make the terms of our service contracts public, what's important is that we believe that Range has the lowest cost per thousand foot of lateral in the basin.", "And secondly, we get our wells to sales faster, reducing the time from capital spent to sales, therefore improving our capital efficiency. Essentially, with the same number of crews, we completed 15% more wells in the first quarter than we did a year ago. I'll refer you back to slide 8 in our updated presentation illustrating the improvements in capital efficiency that we\u2019ve achieved over the past several years. These examples that I've just covered should clearly illustrate why we expect to continue to improve into the future. And most importantly, we continue to work safely and environmentally responsibly.", "Our cost savings have not been at the expense of well performance. We continue to achieve outstanding well results. We recently brought online five wells on a new seven well pad in our super rich area. The wells had an average lateral length of 6,000 feet and were completed with an average of 31 stages. The wells were produced under facility-constrained conditions and had an average 24-hour initial rate to sales of over 3,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 65% liquids.", "Earlier in the quarter, we brought online a three well pad, also in the super rich area, with average initial production to sales of over 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 63% liquids. It\u2019s early, but clearly these pads may significantly outperform the averages and they represent examples of areas where we can focus more capital in the future.", "In our dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, we brought online two different pads worthy of mention. Together, these pads include ten wells, averaging 7,500 foot laterals, completed with 39 stages, with nine of those ten wells online, again under constrained conditions. The nine wells achieved an average initial rate to sales of about 16 million a day per well. These two pads represent opportunities in our dry gas areas where we have fairly new and low-cost gathering systems with ample takeaway and many more multi-well pads and long lateral wells that we can develop going forward.", "On the last call, we discussed the flexibility of going back to existing Marcellus pads to drill additional wells. This morning, I\u2019d like to get into more specifics on a few particular examples. The first example is the pad that has been described in our presentation for some time now and is currently on page 39 of our updated presentation.", "About two years ago, we went back on to a two-year old Marcellus pad and drilled two new infill laterals between the existing laterals. In this particular example, because the pad, road, water infrastructure, production facilities and so forth were already in place, the wells were $850,000 less expensive per well on average than the original well, even though they were 50% longer laterals. The new wells were landed with improved targeting technology and completed with updated frack designs. And after 600 days, the new wells produced 53% more than the original wells. And importantly, the new wells, which were spaced at 700 and 900 feet, respectively, did not impact the production of the original wells.", "A second example is in our dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania where we went back on to an existing three-well pad and drilled three laterals. You can see this example on page 41. The original wells had an average lateral length of 4,800 feet completed with 25 stages and the average initial 24-hour rate to sales, again under constrained conditions, was 22.6 million a day per well. The new wells were drilled about one year later, averaging almost 8,700 foot laterals completed with 45 stages, and under facility constraints have an average initial 24-hour rate to sales of over 34 million a day per well. That's a 50% improvement in initial rates over the older wells. This is one of our very prolific areas that\u2019s performing well above our average type curve, with many opportunities to drill additional wells on this pad and nearby pads.", "A third example is our wet area of Southwest Pennsylvania where we went back on to a two well existing pad and added five new wells with longer laterals and again newer completion technology. You can find this one on page 40. The original wells were completed in 2010 and had an average lateral length of 3,700 feet completed with 13 stages. And the average initial 24-hour rate to sales was 6.7 million a day equivalent per well. Five years later, in 2015, we completed five new wells averaging 1,500 foot laterals completed with 27 stages and these new wells had an average initial 24-hour rate to sales, again under constrained conditions, of 28.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well, which is over 300% improvement in initial in initial rates.", "While we still have many new pads to develop, to restate what we said on the last call, we also have 124 pads with five or fewer wells in addition to 59 pads with 6 to 9 wells. This represents over 180 pads where we have the potential to go back and drill additional wells in any of our stacked pay intervals, whether it's Marcellus, Upper Devonian or Utica. While all these pads represent unique and different opportunities, it\u2019s important to point out that we have the potential to drill wells with reduced capital as significant infrastructure is already in place, lower operating costs as we develop new efficiencies, less gathering and compression as limited incremental infrastructure is needed when you're on an existing pad, potentially improved performances in the previous examples, and very little to no impact on the existing production. All of this results in a step change improvement in capital efficiencies and an even lower F&D like I discussed on the last call.", "Another added and significant benefit is the much shorter execution time. And we avoid the need for any additional surface disturbance. Again, it\u2019s very early in our planning cycle, but we could potentially drill about 50% of our wells next year on existing pads and we believe the savings per well could range from $200,000 to as high as $500,000, depending on each particular situation. Some cases could be more. Again, we believe this is a unique advantage for Range.", "As you know for years now, we've been showing type curves in our presentation on a normalized lateral length basis for the average of the actual wells that we\u2019ll bring to sales in a given year, all under the actual constrained conditions. We believe our average EURs per 1,000 foot are the best in the southwest portion of the play and that\u2019s among a strong performing group of our peers. We also believe our average cost per 1,000 foot are the lowest in the entire play. Again, these are the averages expected in a given year and we've always presented the prior year's production performance to support those type curves. ", "What I\u2019d like to do now is steer away from the averages for a moment and point out a couple of specific areas. Let me began with an area in the dry gas portion of Washington County. This example consists of 22 wells from four separate well pads, in which we are projecting the average recovery is 3.1 Bcf per 1,000 foot. These wells have an average lateral length of 6,300 feet and the EUR is 21% better than our average dry gas area type curve. These wells have a minimum of 180 days and as much as two years of production history.", "Based on the current cost to drill and complete these wells of $5 million, using a flat $3 NYMEX price, the internal rate of return is 61%. We\u2019re planning on turning to sales this year an additional 23 wells from five pads in this area with an average lateral length of approximately 7,000 feet.", "Referring to the previous example I described in the wet gas area, we turn to sales five wells, again, which is illustrated on page 40, will be drilled on an existing pad. The new wells have a projected EUR of 3.6 Bcf equivalent per 1000 foot of lateral. This is 22% higher than our average EUR for the wet area type curve. These wells have been online for 11 months.", "Based on the current cost to drill and complete these wells of $5 million, the return on these wells, using a flat $3 NYMEX price, is 34%. We\u2019re planning on turning to sales over the next 12 months an additional nine wells from two pads in this area, with an average lateral length of over 5,800 feet. We expect to continue with longer laterals going forward.", "In 2014, our average lateral length drilled was 4,915 feet. In 2015, it was about 6,300 feet. And this year, we expect the average to be about 7,100 feet. While it's still early in our planning cycle for 2017, we expect to drill wells that average around 8,000 feet of lateral lengths. Ultimately, we expect we\u2019ll be drilling 10,000 foot laterals on average in the dry area and probably slightly less than that in the liquids areas.", "Just as a point out, we\u2019re planning to turn to sales two wells later this year in the range of 9,500 foot laterals and we\u2019ll also drill three laterals over 13,000 feet this year with the longest planned for 16,220 feet of lateral length.", "Importantly, our HP efforts are largely behind us after this year. Our land budget in 2014 was over $200 million. In 2015, we spent approximately $70 million. And this year, our land budget is reduced to approximately $20 million. Our development plan has positioned us to increase our flexibility going forward by allowing us to focus our capital on the very best return projects.", "While our 2017 plans are still under development, the important things to remember are: We have a large core position, low-cost structure, strong capital efficiency, drilling longer laterals, an attractive transportation portfolio, ability to drill on over 180 existing pads as well as new pads, ability to focus on our best and most prolific areas, ability to increase liquids production when economically warranted, a low decline base production, very low maintenance CapEx, and finally strong operations and technical teams with a proven track record.", "To the answer the common question about maintenance CapEx, if you consider what I've discussed here this morning regarding our ability to drill on existing pads, along with targeting some of our better areas, and couple that with our low base decline rate of approximately 19%, we have the ability to hold our 2007 production flat to this year's expected exit rate for $300 million or less.", "We believe this low level of maintenance CapEx makes our production incredibly resilient if prices were to stay low, while providing us a solid base to grow from when the supply and demand equation improves and prices move higher. The point is that whatever prices do and wherever we set the drilling throttle, having a really low maintenance CapEx works in our favor.", "Shifting to marketing, utilizing our Mariner East transportation, Range loaded the very first VLGC from the East Coast with 550,000 barrels of propane on March 19. Range also saw the first INEOS ship set sail from the East Coast during the first quarter. Both ethane and propane ships are now leaving Marcus Hook on a regular basis and having international exposure for our products is expected to benefit our net back pricing going forward.", "Looking ahead, our next transportation option coming into service is the Texas Eastern Gulf market\u2019s expansion project expected to start later this year. This project will allow us to ship more production to the Gulf Coast region, anticipating a positive impact to our sales portfolio.", "By the end of this year, we\u2019ll have about 70% of our gas sold outside the Basin. And like Jeff said earlier, by late 2017, we\u2019ll have over 80% of our gas sold outside the Basin, which we expect to result in better net back pricing.", "As a further update, on our third Utica well, the DMC 10H is currently shut in for facilities build out and an extended bottom hole pressure buildup. We expect to bring the well to sales in about 60 days. The just over 30-day flow-back test initiated immediately after completion, again with no aging, averaged 18.3 million a day to sales with the gas rate essentially held flat with high flowing pressures. You can see how this well\u2019s performance compares to some of the nearby and noteworthy Utica wells drilled by our peers on page 35 in our updated presentation.", "Early data indicates that this well could be one of the top wells today in the play. Our current expectations are that the well will be put to sales at approximately 12 million a day. The first phase of the reservoir modeling suggests it should hold that rate flat for approximately 500 days before declining. We\u2019ll know a lot more in a few months once we complete the next phase of our data acquisition and modeling and the well is actually put to sales. But, again, early indications are good.", "As most of you know, the Utica cost almost 2.5 times more than our dry Marcellus. And while the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential, even with anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells currently far exceed Utica returns.", "Given limited production history thus far, on a risk-adjusted basis, it\u2019s clear to us that our high quality Marcellus wells are the superior investment. Our Utica potential is held by our Marcellus development and over time we expect that Utica can be a complementary development opportunity. But, for now, our plan for the rest of this year is to monitor our three wells along with the offset well, while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine the path forward from there.", "In the meantime, we\u2019ll remain focused on high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible. As we continue to lower costs, improve efficiencies, drill longer laterals, and develop our core assets, we remain well positioned to create value.", "Over to Roger.", "Roger Manny", "Thanks, Ray.", "There were many successes in the first quarter of 2016 as Range continued to effectively position the company for the current economic environment and a future with higher takeaway capacity and better pricing.", "Starting with the balance sheet this time, we ended the quarter with less debt than we entered and our capital spending plans are right on track to produce prudent growth in production and reserves with improving capital efficiency.", "A major highlight of the quarter was the unanimous reaffirmation of our annually-determined $3 billion bank credit facility borrowing base. Beyond the committed liquidity it provides, looking behind the numbers at the approval process reveals three significant positive read-throughs.", "First, the reaffirmation excluded the collateral value associated with the December 2015 Nora sale and the two more recent asset sales, which in aggregate exceeded $1 billion in sale proceeds in the unique portfolio of value-added marketing arrangements we have for our natural gas, NGLs and condensate, which will improve future pricing.", "Our recycle ratio, based on our year-end 2015 reserve report F&D cost, projected 2016 unit cost structure projected 2016 basis to NYMEX and current unhedged strip price for 2017 is approaching two times, ensuring that we can continue to grow our reserves and production within unhedged future cash flow. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we believe, an underappreciated element, that balance sheet strength and preservation is having an unhedged recycle ratio above one times which allows for both growth and debt reduction at the same time over time.", "Our first quarter ending debt-to-EBITDAX ratio for the past three years has been 3 times, 2.8 times, and 2.9 times respectively. The ratio at the end of this year's first quarter is a very manageable 3.3 times. As a reminder, Range has no debt-to-EBITDAX covenant, no bond maturities till 2021, $1.3 billion in freshly committed liquidity, low maintenance capital requirements, complete control over our capital spending level and timing, and a robust recycle ratio well over one time.", "With prices improving, our recycle ratio will also continue to improve and the debt-to-EBITDAX ratio will eventually crest over or decline with no negative impact to our operations.", "Turning to the income statement, comparing the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of last year, the impact of 45% lower realized prices could not be offset through production growth and cost reductions. First quarter net loss was $92 million, largely prompted by a $43 million pretax impairment of certain Oklahoma properties.", "First quarter earnings based on analyst methodology, which eliminates non-cash and non-recurring entries, was a loss of $17 million or $0.10 per fully diluted share.", "On the cost side of the ledger, cash unit cost were down $0.01 from last year and total unit costs, including DD&A, was down $0.29 from last year. All cost categories came in below guidance with direct cash operating costs at $0.19 per mcfe, breaking the $0.20 level for the first time. The main reason for the large operating cost beat was the absence of a severe winter and the avoided cost of tending to our wells with added shifts during periods of extreme cold.", "Transportation, gathering and compression were also well below guidance at $1 per mcfe. This positive variance to guidance may be attributed to lower costs associated with our production mix and also lower transportation costs that were avoided due to the delayed full system startup of the Mariner East project.", "Second quarter expense guidance may be found in the earnings release and other useful costs and hedging data, as Laith mentioned, may be found in the supplemental tables posted to the Range Web site.", "Cash flow for the first quarter was $99 million and cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.59. First quarter EBITDAX was $135 million.", "Range remains well hedged in 2016, with more than 80% of our 2016 gas production carrying a floor of 3.22/MMBtu. As 2017 and 2018 NYMEX gas prices have improved and because our full cycle cost structure is so low, we have commenced limited natural gas hedging in these years to reduce downside price risk and ensure cash flows available for growth.", "We\u2019ve also added to our NGL hedge position during the quarter, the details of which can be found in the 10-Q, earnings release and on the Web site.", "To summarize the first quarter, we\u2019ve continued to successfully shed non-core assets, decrease debt, reduce our cost structure and improve our capital efficiency, while delivering consistent growth. Looking ahead, we see continued disciplined growth with even better capital efficiency, plus improved pricing from our new ethane, propane and condensate marketing arrangements. As Ray described in his remarks, this really sets us up well for 2017 and beyond.", "Jeff, I\u2019ll turn it back to you.", "Jeff Ventura", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Ventura. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Doug Leggate", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Ventura", "Good morning. ", "Doug Leggate", "Jeff, first of all, congratulations on another very strong operating quarter given the circumstances. But, I guess, the question that seems to be getting asked to a lot of your oily peers is, is there a level when you would consider putting rigs back to work? Now, I realize $2 gas price may be a little premature or certainly irrelevant in this market. But just conceptually, given the efficiencies that you have baked into the system, given the continued improvement you delivered for the last several years, what is your philosophy in terms of how you see Range\u2019s longer-term targets evolving, assuming that gas prices do improve? And I\u2019m thinking back to when you used to talk about 20-plus growth as an annual run rate in the longer-term.", "Jeff Ventura", "That\u2019s great question. Let me talk about it in a very conceptual way. Again, I think we\u2019re in a great position. We\u2019re in the highest quality gas play that\u2019s there with economics, I think, that really rival any play. It\u2019s a stack pay area. By the end of this year, it\u2019s predominantly HBP, so we\u2019ve got a lot of optionality not only in drilling Marcellus, Utica, or Upper Devonian, but drilling wet or dry.", "We\u2019ve got really low maintenance CapEx, which I think is important. And I think is \u2013 if it isn\u2019t best-in-class, it\u2019s clearly right up there. Coupled with really good marketing agreements. Now, there are a lot \u2013 our newest piece that\u2019s in place, Mariner East. So the ability to move ethane, propane or natural gas really to multiple markets around the US or even internationally, the ability to go back on existing pads, those are all key things.", "So I think what you\u2019ll see is too is we\u2019re in great shape in a low-price environment. We believe that a lot of good fundamentals are setting up for natural gas to improve. We think this will be the first year natural gas supply rolls since 2005 or something back like that, coupled with a time where demand is coming up.", "So in a lower \u2013 for a longer scenario, we are well-positioned. In a higher price scenario, we have a lot of optionality. Ray has talked about it and can continue to talk about. I think when you look at our fracking efficiency, it\u2019s probably best-in-class or right up there, our drilling efficiency and wells. So we have the ability to ramp when need be. But we\u2019re going to be very returns-focused. We\u2019ll be sensitive to balance sheet and those types of things. So we have \u2013 we have a lot of optionality to push the throttle forward or to pull it back, which is, I think, the position that we want to be in.", "So that\u2019s kind of a long-winded answer, but I think philosophically we\u2019ll think about the returns we\u2019re getting. We\u2019ll think about the balance sheet and all those types of things. But we have a lot of optionality with what we have. The team continues to get better, better and better as evidenced by the capital efficiency and we have tried to slice and dice that in multiple ways, everything from a high-level graph that shows our capital efficiency to some of the specifics. And, again, feel free to ask Ray about some of those. I think when you look at them versus peers, they are impressive numbers.", "So that\u2019s kind of philosophically how we look at it.", "Doug Leggate", "I guess what I\u2019m kind of struggling with this if you assume any kind of modest recovery in gas prices, you could pretty much make your growth rate whatever you wanted it to be. So I\u2019m just trying to think how you would trend limits around that, whether it would be balance sheet or some kind of EBITDA coverage ratio or\u2026?", "Jeff Ventura", "Yeah, yeah. Clearly, balance sheet is important. Spending typically is going to be \u2013 I think, philosophically, is going to be at or near cash flow \u2013 or at on your cash flow. But I\u2019ll basically leave it at that. Roger, do you want to add on to that a little bit or\u2026?", "Roger Manny", "I think, Doug, it\u2019s going to be game time decision when we move forward and we\u2019re just going to read the market and we\u2019re going to look at all the dials and adjust the throttle accordingly. I just don\u2019t think it makes any sense to try to lock into a number right now. It\u2019s too dynamic.", "Doug Leggate", "Absolutely, I understand. My other question is really just a little bit more \u2013 it\u2019s less about the operations and more about the disposal program. You held on to the stack, Jeff. I\u2019m just wondering what we should read into that. Are you looking for a better market? Or are you thinking \u2013 if that\u2019s something you might want to put your own capital to work in at some point?", "Jeff Ventura", "Let me clarify that one. We marketed that in two pieces. The southern package was actually in the stack play. It was about roughly 9,000 acres of \u2013 scattered across three counties, kind of small broken up pieces, but in the play, collectively producing about 5 million per day equivalent net from 200 wells \u2013 200 all legacy, vertical wells. You can do the math there. So the price that we got for that, we thought, was a very strong price for that kind of position, particularly in today\u2019s market.", "When you looked at the northern piece, which is bigger, and about 19,000 net acres, it\u2019s mainly in Major County \u2013 predominantly in Major County, which is north of the stack play. But the play is clearly moving in that direction and there\u2019s rigs coming right up to us. And it\u2019s also in the emerging Osage plays and there is other plays. So we actually have eight rigs drilling in and around us. It\u2019s all HBP. So our thoughts are to just wait, watch some of the drilling results that we expect will be good and just sell into a better price. So we have \u2013 because it\u2019s HBP, we have the optionality of time. So I think you\u2019ll see us sell that and market it in due time.", "There\u2019s a lot of drilling activity. You can take a map of our acreage. It was up on our Web site at one time or the IR team will give it you. You can look at the active rigs, I\u2019m sure, if you subscribe to those services. There\u2019s a lot of activity around us.", "The remaining stuff we have in the Panhandle and up in the northern Oklahoma, I think you\u2019ll just see us sell us with time, but we\u2019ll do it at an opportune time. It\u2019s similar to the Nora sale. We didn\u2019t just \u2013 Nora, we had to find the right buyer at the right time. We were very pleased with the sale. Hopefully, it\u2019s a win-win for both sides. But it\u2019s finding that buyer that really likes the asset. Bradford County was the same thing. I know people that follow us, we had that for sale for a long time. We\u2019re very disciplined and we finally found the buyer that paid us what we thought was a price.", "I think if you look at both of those cases, the price we got was about double what most of the people thought Nora or Bradford County was worth. So I think the remaining stuff in Oklahoma, particularly that northern part of the acreage in Major County, it\u2019s just picking the right time and the right buyer. But you\u2019ll see us sell that with time.", "Doug Leggate", "Great stuff, Jeff. Yeah, we\u2019re watching you very closely, as you say. I\u2019ll let someone else jump on. Thanks a lot.", "Jeff Ventura", "Thank you, Doug.", "Ray Walker", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.", "Neal Dingmann", "Morning, guys. I certainly would echo Doug\u2019s comments. You were great operationally. Jeff, one question for you, and then more to Ray on the efficiencies. Just on that last question, Jeff, additional non-core sales, just kind of wondering what else you\u2019re seeing out there besides, obviously, you had two strong sales here recently. Are there other things you could tee up here shortly?", "Jeff Ventura", "Clearly, I think the Major County package, it\u2019s probably marketable. I hate to always put time frames on them. But I think, later this year, or at the optimum time, we would definitely consider that stuff. In the Texas Panhandle, we have a nice position that. It\u2019s non-core to us. There\u2019s other people that really like that area. Mississippi, and again, and you can even \u2013 we carved off Bradford County, so it was a little slice of the Marcellus that wasn\u2019t key to us that was important for somebody else. You can envision things like that with time.", "Neal Dingmann", "Okay. And then, maybe for Ray, I was definitely intrigued by our comment that 50% plus of you wells, as you mentioned, next year could be on older pads. And so, I\u2019m looking at that, plus, obviously, just doing the bigger pads, the six to nine-well pads. Ray, based on that and those type of efficiencies, what type of cost savings are potential? It looks to me like it could be quite large.", "Ray Walker", "It\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s more of a continual process. If you look at page eight in our presentation, we show what we\u2019ve been able to do literally and what I think that matters at the bottom line is the total cost per lateral foot. And you look at that over the years and you\u2019ve seen really good improvement. And even the cross years where service costs were actually going up, we were making significant improvements. A lot of that\u2019s driven by drilling longer laterals. It\u2019s just the fact that our teams and our service crews are getting more and more experienced, all of those things factoring in, are allowing us to keep doing what we\u2019re doing. And I think that we\u2019re going to see probably half of our wells \u2013 could be less, could be more \u2013 we\u2019re really, really early in the planning cycle at this point. But some of the things I talked about in my prepared remarks \u2013 and when you couple the savings or the fact that you don\u2019t have to build pads and roads and production facilities, other things that we don\u2019t talk a lot about, or things like survey, land, title curative, we\u2019ve got water infrastructure and depending on where that pad is in relation to the current water infrastructure we have in place, all of those things you could save couple of hundred thousand dollars a well or you could save up to $850,000 a well depending on the particular situation.", "And I think those kind of savings are real. I think it\u2019s taken us lots of years to develop a very large core asset area. We\u2019ve got a great low base decline rate which allows us to build very efficiently with the capital that we allocate. We\u2019ve got some \u2013 clearly some really high prolific performing areas, like I went through them in my remarks. Couple of examples there that we can focus on. We\u2019ve got new infrastructure that\u2019s always continually still being built, like some of the new dry gas stuff I talked about in my remarks.", "So I think it\u2019s just all \u2013 and you roll all that together, the fact that we\u2019ve got a great transportation portfolio, we\u2019ve got diverse outlets for operational aspects and as far as pricing aspects, a lot of these things have taken years to develop. All of our HBP concerns are covered this year. And so, we\u2019ve got a great future going forward. And I think we can just continue that capital efficiency. The service contractors can continue to give us great pricing because of the high utilization rates. We don\u2019t think anyone else in the Basin is operating at the number of fracks per day that we are or anywhere close. So I think there is a lot of things out there like that that just give us a pretty unique advantage when you compare us to all of peers.", "Neal Dingmann", "Great, great. And then one last one, if I could. I love that slide 15, your gas and plays. I know you and Bill were probably the first ever to put that out there. And I\u2019m just wondering, number one, is that continuing to grow? Obviously, you look where that red area was and, to me, you guys have been dead right here now for the last couple of years on that. Two questions, I guess, around that. One, do you see that expanding at all or are you pretty content there? And then secondly, when you do some of these dry Utica gas wells there, in order to keep the cost down, what things can you do? I guess because of the pressure, do you still have to use the ceramic versus the sand? I\u2019m just wondering what things you can do in that area to keep the cost down on those dry Utica wells?", "Jeff Ventura", "All right. Two great questions. I think the gas and plays math, we\u2019ve had for a long time internally. And then, of course, we made them public, I guess, two or three years back. And they\u2019re actually holding very true. I think, as we\u2019ve seen, more and more development occur in the Utica and in Upper Devonian and, of course, in the Marcellus. I think they\u2019ve held really true. I think it\u2019s going to be like \u2013 most plays, historically, have been where the true core sweet spots tend to shrink and so forth. I think that\u2019s a big reason behind our low base decline rate, is I think we have better hydrocarbons \u2013 better hydrocarbon content, I should say, better perm, better porosity, better pressures. So we get better desorption of gas in the long run, a lot of those things help us. But I think they\u2019re going to hold pretty true. Clearly, the Utica is really early, especially on the Pennsylvania side. But we\u2019re pretty pleased about that.", "Going forward on the Utica, we think when we get ready to do the next well and we\u2019re not sure when exactly that\u2019s going to be yet, but we can do, based on what we know today, a 6,500 foot lateral for around $12 million \u2013 probably less now. An 8,000 foot lateral or so, we can probably do for about $14 million or less. We think that\u2019s probably an industry-leading cost already. We\u2019re a little bit shallower than some of the other wells. So there\u2019s a little bit less cost there.", "We, in our last well, completed it with \u2013 I think it was 5,800 feet with 38 stages and we were 500,000 pounds per stage and it was 50/50 100 mesh and 40/70 premium white sand. So we don\u2019t think ceramics is going to be necessary, at least in our acreage. That\u2019s going to keep cost way down.", "Of course, every well that you get under your belt, you learn a lot more, so a little bit less science is required. We will continue to drill these wells on existing Marcellus pads. So you\u2019ve got a lot of savings there, like we\u2019ve talked about previously. And I think all of those things set us up well. We\u2019re pretty convinced, the 400,000 acres is going to be really high-quality stuff. But at this point in time, as good as we can do, it\u2019s still 2.5 times more expensive than a dry gas Marcellus well in the eastern part of Washington County. And when you look at that, some of these Marcellus wells that I talked about in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re making about the same volume, if not more, in a year\u2019s time. And we can get it for 2.5 times less dollars. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to focus our capital, especially in this market.", "But do we believe the Utica can be a big deal going forward? Yes. Do we believe it can be influential? Yes. Do we believe it\u2019s going to be competitive? No. We think it\u2019s going to be complementary because it\u2019s something that\u2019s stacked with our Marcellus stuff. So I think that\u2019s where we see that going forward. But we\u2019re very encouraged. And again, I\u2019ll refer you to page 35, I think it is, in our presentation and look at how it performs versus some of our offset peers\u2019 wells that have been real noteworthy and they\u2019re all great wells. No doubt about it. But I think what we\u2019re seeing is our acreage can be right up there among the best acreage that there is in the play.", "Neal Dingmann", "Very helpful, guys. Thanks so much.", "Ray Walker", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Kistler of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.", "David Kistler", "Good morning, guys. And great work. This goes back to kind of the existing pads and the cost savings that you talked about there. Obviously, the low-hanging fruit is the fixed cost component, the pads that are there, the tanks, the roads, et cetera. But can you give us a little bit more breakdown in terms of how you guys think about it in terms of what it does to the actual operating cost metrics and the gathering side of the component and how that will flow through and whether that's truly captured in this $250,000 to $850,000 well savings you talk about?", "Ray Walker", "Yeah. Dave, this is Ray. It\u2019s a great question. Again, the savings \u2013 the $200,000 to $500,000, let\u2019s say, or $600,000, whatever it might be in a particular case, that\u2019s going to be the dirt work, things like building the pad and the road, then you\u2019ve got the actual production facilities which, as you know, the separators, the production tanks, the heater treaters, all those different things. They\u2019re going to be different in the super rich versus the wet versus the dry area. They\u2019re all different. I think people tend to group this together and say, it\u2019s going to be the same all the way across and they forget that, number one, we have a really large position and, number two, it\u2019s really diverse. So we\u2019ve got lots of different designs of facilities that we deal with. But it\u2019s going to be all of the meter taps, things like that. Then you\u2019ve got things like damages that you pay the landowners, survey cost, title curative, you\u2019ve got a lot of different things like that that we don\u2019t talk a whole lot about, which are really significant.", "You\u2019ve got water infrastructure. If it\u2019s a pad that\u2019s right near an impoundment or right on a pipeline network, of course, the water cost could vary by several hundred thousand dollars on a pad. And some of the new things that we\u2019re doing lately, today, we\u2019re saving, on average, probably $300,000, maybe $350,000 per pad on water cost. It\u2019s that significant when you\u2019re drilling a new four-well pad. It\u2019s really significant if we just go back and add one or two wells on a pad. So I think those things are \u2013 all the capital costs that roll in there.", "If you think about going back on to an existing pad and there is room in the gathering system, which is why we would go back on to an existing pad, you don\u2019t have to add any more compression or low pressure pipe. And when you do that, that\u2019s a significant part of the cost in our gathering, compression and transportation line, which is \u2013 I think it was $0.99 or whatever it was for the first quarter. Significant piece of that is that low-pressure gathering and compression charge.", "When you go back with an existing well, you could see those numbers be a lot less. I\u2019m not going to quote a number because they\u2019re all different. But it could be \u2013 most of that cost goes away essentially. You\u2019re really only looking at the variable cost of fuel and a few little things like that, of putting that new production online into that existing system. So there are a lot of things like that that help us.", "And as far as LOEs and things, the way it helps you there is, basically, you\u2019re not adding new equipment and new infrastructure that you have to add new lease operators for to cover. In other words, going back on to an existing pad doesn\u2019t cause us to add more personnel, it doesn\u2019t cause us to really add a lot more chemicals or maintenance or anything else like that. It\u2019s the kind of stuff that\u2019s already there and being operated.", "So I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a long-winded, roundabout way to talk about some of those things. But all of that helps us reach the capital efficiencies that we are with. And again, this has been a process that we actually talked about in the very early days, way back in 2007 and 2008 when we started drilling and building some of these pads. And it\u2019s been a goal all along to build these pads where we can go back and drill as many as 10, 15, 18 wells in some cases. We were always really focused on the fact of having diverse outlooks, diverse pricing scenarios for our products, and not being dependent upon any one situation or project. All of those things have really helped us. And this year\u2019s really a turning point here for us because of some of the big projects like Mariner East coming online. Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City was a pipeline project that we worked on for years. Later this year, we\u2019ve got the Gulf Coast project coming online. All of those things have taken years to put in place. And I think that\u2019s a very unique part of our story going forward.", "David Kistler", "I appreciate that color. That\u2019s fantastic. Maybe kind of building off on the last point there, when you guys start selecting which pads to go back to, can you talk a little bit about how much maybe closest proximity to highest price markets factors in? You already indicated a little bit in terms of how important it is to be closer to various infrastructure just in terms of being able to get that gas or NGLs to market. But how much of that factors in also to the decision of how you select the pads and the timing of when you\u2019ll be going back to various areas, whether it be super rich, wet, dry, et cetera.", "Ray Walker", "That\u2019s a great question, Dave. And it\u2019s really all of that. Plus, I would add in there, it\u2019s not always going to be going back on existing pads because we have some \u2013 in some of the stuff I talked about in my prepared remarks, some of these wells that \u2013 I talked about the recent performance and then some of the existing wells that we\u2019ve done and following up, like that example of the ten different wells from several different pads. When you look at that, the economics on that stuff \u2013 even if you build a new pad is probably better than going back on the existing pads in today\u2019s world in the wet and super rich area. So we\u2019ve got that flexibility to go both ways. And it really comes down to what gives us the best overall project return for our capital in a year\u2019s time. Where are we going to be able to \u2013 if you put a dollar in, where are we going to get the most dollars out? And it\u2019s really that simple. But we have to factor in all those things you talked about, whether it\u2019s markets, proximity to infrastructure, timing of sales that we\u2019ve done with customers, all of those different things factor into that.", "David Kistler", "I appreciate the added color and great to see the scale and scope is now really starting to kick in on the asset base.", "Ray Walker", "Thanks, Dave.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Dan McSpirit", "Thank you. And good morning, folks.", "Jeff Ventura", "Good morning.", "Ray Walker", "Good morning. ", "Dan McSpirit", "Couple of questions quickly, if I may, on cash margins. Regarding your guidance on differentials in NGL pricing, what potential do you see for that to change either the back part of this year or periods beyond that? Can we see narrower differentials on more gas leaving the basin and better NGL pricing on barrels being shipped than what\u2019s guided?", "Jeff Ventura", "I will maybe tag-team that. But I think if you look on slide 14, it shows projected average differentials in 2016 versus 2017. So we were expecting those differentials for the year to average $0.40 to $.45 less from NYMEX. Into 2017, the expectation is that could improve to $0.25 to $0.35. We expect significantly better NGL pricing this year as a result of new contracts and movement \u2013 Mariner East starting up, plus some of the early things where we have kind of that optionality to either export or move in the US markets. Again, being a competitive advantage being the only producer who has capacity on Mariner East. But when you look at slide 14, coupled with some of the slides in there about the NGLs, we think that we\u2019ll see significant improvement.", "Dan McSpirit", "Okay. And then a follow-up to that, just confirming that your guidance on transportation costs capture the increase in production being priced outside of the Appalachian Basin, just inquiring, again, just to assess the risk to cash margins here going forward.", "Ray Walker", "This is Ray. I\u2019ll answer that. All of those projections that we put in there going forward are based on the current deals and transportation deals like Spectra's Uniontown to Gas City, cost some money to send the gas over there. But we, net-net, end up with a much better revenue because we got a much better realized price for our gas.", "Same thing on the NGLs. We\u2019re now transporting 75% of our barrel, ethane and propane, out of Appalachia. The VLGCs on the propane is saving us a nickel a gallon. On a $0.50 a gallon product, that\u2019s a big deal. We\u2019re hedging international spreads on probably a third of our second half of 2016 production and that\u2019s looking really good. Shipping rates have come down to $0.04. They could go lower. We\u2019re hearing lots of good things about the propane market and we\u2019re hearing lots of good buzz about the ethane market. So we\u2019re pretty encouraged going forward. Can\u2019t peg down exactly when it happens, but I think, again, with us focusing on our low-cost structure, multiple outlets not being dependent upon any one particular project, we\u2019re set up really well going forward.", "Dan McSpirit", "Got it, thank you. And many thanks for taking my questions. Have a great day.", "Jeff Ventura", "Thank you.", "Ray Walker", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached the end of the time limit for our Q&A session. And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.", "Jeff Ventura", "Thank you very much for participating on our call.

The speakers on the today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Chief Financial Officer.", "Hopefully you've had a chance to review the press release and updated Investor Presentation that we've posted on our website. We'll be referencing some of the slides this morning. We also filed our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.", "Before we begin, let me also point out that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. In addition, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of these non-GAAP measures and to provide more detail on both natural gas and NGL pricing.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Laith. We remain very excited about our pending merger with Memorial, but since we don't expect to close the transaction until mid to late September, Ray and I will primarily focus our comments on the results, opportunities and plans for our Marcellus operations. In the next quarterly call we expect to be able to talk more about plans for the combined company.", "I'll begin by reviewing what Range accomplished during the second quarter, then I'll discuss some of the key attributes we have that set us up for continued success. Range's ability to consistently drill low-cost, high-return wells across our acreage in the Marcellus, as well as focus on driving down unit costs, resulted in strong operating results for the quarter.", "Comparing unit costs realized during the quarter to this time last year, Range's LOE is down 44%, G&A is down 23%, interest expense down 17%, and DD&A was $0.95 in the second quarter, down 22% year-over-year. We continued to achieve operational improvements in the Marcellus and our wells continued to exhibit strong performance. Ray will discuss this in greater detail.", "All three of our liquids projects are now fully operational and we have the ability to move ethane to Europe, Canada and the Gulf Coast. We have the flexibility to export propane from Marcus Hook to anywhere in the world, or to sell into the Northeast markets whenever it is advantageous to do so. All of the gas pipelines we're contracted on are either on-line or on schedule, including Spectra's Gulf Coast expansion in the fourth quarter of 2016, Columbia's Rayne/Leach Xpress in third quarter of 2017, and Rover Phase 2 in the fourth quarter of 2017.", "By the end of this year, approximately 70% of our natural gas is projected to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin, further improving our expected natural gas differentials going forward. By year-end 2017, we expect over 80% of our production to be sold in markets outside of the Appalachian Basin.", "Gas pricing remained challenged during the second quarter, but pricing has improved since and there are signs that later this year and into 2017, supply and demand will be more balanced and pricing could significantly improve. We expect natural gas production in the U.S. to continue declining for the remainder of this year. In Appalachia, there are only about 30 rigs drilling for natural gas in the Marcellus and Utica formations, with the rigs about equally divided between the two plays. We estimate that it would take approximately 50 rigs to hold production flat in the Marcellus and Utica. An estimate to put 20 additional rigs back to work, including all associated costs to put the wells on-line, would result in additional of $4 billion of capital per year.", "It's also important to note that the drilled uncompleted well inventory in the Marcellus and Utica combined continues to decline and appears to be down about 34% in 2016. The rig counts in all of the other U.S. gas basins are at historic lows, and productions in these basins is declining. In addition, total associated gas from the oil plays continues to decline on a monthly basis since December 2014 and is down over 5% year-to-date. This supply decline is happening while demand for natural gas is increasing, primarily driven by Mexican exports, power generation and LNG exports.", "Looking into 2017, the NYMEX strip has moved above $3 and we believe it can continue to climb. There's also a brighter outlook for ethane and propane for 2017. At Range, if these prices -increases occur, we have the ability to ramp activity with increased cash flow. We have 231 existing pads that we can go back onto to drill additional wells, which increases capital efficiency and decreases the cycle time to ramp up.", "Given our large footprint in Southwest Pennsylvania, we also have the ability to shift capital to drill in the dry, wet or super-rich areas. We are permitting wells across all areas and have the ability to allocate capital on a real-time basis to the highest return assets based on current market conditions. To the extent there's available space in a portion of the gathering system, we'll direct drilling there, which will reduce our gathering costs.", "We are pleased to report that the merger with Memorial is moving along well, and we currently expect to close in mid-September. As we said when the deal was announced, we believe that combining two of the highest quality North American natural gas and NGL assets will create a premier domestic natural gas company with a resilient and flexible platform for sustained growth.", "We believe that Range's Marcellus and Memorial's Lower Cotton Valley are the two lowest-cost gas plays in the United States and are strategically located near key demand centers. The combination creates a unique portfolio with more optionality for Range and an enhanced ability to serve our end customers. The product mix in both assets are similar, which enables us to utilize our marketing expertise for both natural gas and NGLs, and leverage our existing customer and transport relationships to find innovative sales arrangements, just as we've done in the past. Perfect examples include our relationships and agreements to sell ethane to NOVA Chemicals and INEOS as well as our marketing of international propane.", "On the technical side, we continue to improve the economics of the Marcellus and have identified transferrable ideas that can enhance the economics of the Lower Cotton Valley, resulting in improved capital efficiency and returns. Lastly, the merger will benefit from the existing Range corporate infrastructure, procurement and other expertise, which is expected to achieve lower unit costs, enhance profitability throughout the commodity price cycles, and result in a better, stronger company.", "In summary, we believe the combined entity offers investors five key positive attributes. The first is a very high-quality, low-cost asset base in two complementary basins. The second is improved capital efficiency, as illustrated by the opportunity to go back onto existing pads to drill new wells in the Marcellus and to drill highly prolific wells in the Lower Cotton Valley. Continuing to drill longer laterals and optimizing landing and targeting will also drive improved capital efficiency in both regions. The third key attribute is top-flight operational execution, as evidenced by a consistent track record of operational achievements.", "The fourth is a strong marketing effort, highlighted by Range's ability to move ethane and propane to multiple domestic and international markets and to move natural gas to multiple markets within the U.S., with over 80% of our Marcellus gas moving to markets outside the Appalachian Basin by the end of 2017. Finally, the combined company will have an even stronger balance sheet with ample liquidity and a strong hedge position for 2016 and 2017. All of these attributes position Range to deliver strong operating results and build sustainable long-term shareholder value.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Jeff.", "We continue to execute our strategy with notable success. We're focused on improving well performance, prudently allocating capital to our highest-quality properties, improving capital efficiency, and continuing to drive down cost in all categories.", "Production for the second quarter came in at 1.421 Bcf equivalent per day with 36% liquids. And for the third quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.43 Bcf equivalent per day with similar liquids. Our annual guidance remains at the high end of 1.41 Bcf equivalent to 1.42 Bcf equivalent per day, which would represent growth of approximately 10% over last year. And we're still forecasting sequential quarterly growth with our exit rate being higher than it was at the end of 2015, which sets us up well for growth in 2017.", "We've continued to drive down our overall unit cost in the second quarter, resulting in an 8% reduction from the prior-year quarter. As Jeff mentioned earlier, all of the categories were better than expected, but I believe they're worth mentioning again. Our operating teams continue to work more efficiently and our LOE per Mcfe is 44% lower than a year ago, and 21% lower than the prior quarter. G&A was down 23% and DD&A was down 22% year-over-year. All these are examples of our teams driving down costs and increasing efficiencies, while working safely with a focus on environmental responsibility.", "Driving a lot of our LOE improvements is the handling of water. Remember, Range was the company that introduced the reuse of flow-back and produced water, and the first company to achieve 100% reuse back in 2009. With some very creative and innovative thinking, our team will save over $18 million in water handling this year, impacting the CapEx ledger while also lowering LOE cost.", "This savings is driven primarily by three things: first, improved completion designs, meaning a greater focus on proppant placement and conductivity rather than water volume; second, a steady and highly efficient frac program, allowing us to work cooperatively with many operators in the area that supply reuse water to our sites at no cost to Range, thereby greatly reducing our cost; and third, we've been able to really focus on our infrastructure and water handling logistics, therefore developing advantages that are very unique to our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. Minimizing our cost for handling water is a huge advantage, and not having a water MLP that we would have to feed allows us to focus on the true bottom-line cost.", "Capital efficiency continues to improve, and I'll go through just a few examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania. On the completions front, we completed 1,067 stages. This is a 23% improvement over the second quarter of last year with the same number of frac crews as we had last year. We've reduced the total average completion cost per foot of lateral by 25% compared to last year.", "Our top four pads completed in 2016 have averaged over 8.3 stages a day for a total of 173 stages. The best pad achieved a completion cost per foot of almost 15% below the average, which again was already 25% lower than last year. We're forecasting a 23% reduction in CapEx for production facilities, resulting in almost $9 million in savings this year as a result of design improvements, reductions in labor and materials, and redeployment of existing equipment.", "On the drilling side, we achieved a 27% reduction in drilling cost per foot compared to last year, while drilling 6% more lateral feet in the quarter. The laterals drilled during the second quarter were 8% longer than last year, and seven out of our top 10 days for lateral feet drilled in a day were in the first half of 2016. This illustrates that we're still improving and expect to continue. Our best well drilled this quarter and our fastest well to-date was an 8,634-foot lateral drilled at a cost that was 38% lower than our average, again with our average during the quarter being 27% lower than last year.", "As we've covered many times in the past, we believe our average total well costs per foot, including facilities, are the best in the Southwest portion of the basin. We believe if you look at some of our recent achievements, which are clearly more than just a few wells, you'll begin to appreciate the improving capital efficiency that we expect to see going forward. This, combined with the ability to go back on existing pads and infrastructure, as well as with drilling longer laterals, suggests we can build significant value going forward. Again, all of this is being done safely and in an environmentally sound manner by a strong operations and technical team and by all our folks across the company.", "Today, we can drill a 9,000-foot lateral and complete it with 45 stages, averaging 2,000 pounds of proppant per foot of lateral in our wet area, with full facilities on a brand-new four-well pad, for approximately $7.7 million per well. If we did so on an existing pad, the well cost could be as low as $7 million a well. In comparison to our peers, our cost is less \u2013 over $1 million less on an apples-to-apples basis \u2013 and our well performance is better, resulting in better economics than any of our peers in the Southwest portion of the basin.", "I should point out that this is not just theoretical. We have many of these types of longer lateral wells planned for the future. For example, we plan to drill a seven-well pad in our super-rich area later this year, averaging approximately 10,700-foot laterals, with the longest at 14,500 feet. These wells will be completed early next year, and we look forward to sharing the results of these and other long lateral pads in the future.", "We continue to achieve outstanding well performance. I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through some of our recent top performing wells. We recently completed a seven-well pad, averaging 5,717-foot laterals in 30 stages in the super-rich area, near the end of the first quarter and into the beginning of the second quarter. The average 24-hour rate to sales under constrained conditions was 20.6 million cubic feet equivalent per day, or 3,434 barrels of oil equivalent per day since it was 73% liquids.", "In the wet area, our top pad was a three-well pad averaging 6,782-foot laterals with 35 stages. The initial 24-hour rate to sales under constrained conditions was 27.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day. And in our dry area of Southwest Pennsylvania, our top pad was a five-well pad averaging 7,424-foot laterals with 38 stages per well, and the initial 24-hour rate to sales, again under constrained conditions, was 26.7 million cubic feet a day.", "I'd also like to review some of the best wells we've drilled on a normalized EUR per 1,000 foot of lateral basis. All of these wells have been turned to sales within the last nine months. Let me start with the dry area in Washington County. This is the five-well pad that I mentioned earlier that was brought on-line in April of 2016, averaging 7,424-foot laterals. This pad is in the same area as the pad in the presentation on page 42 where we went back on the pad and drilled additional wells.", "This five-well pad is similar in recoveries to that pad at over 3 Bcf per 1,000 foot, or over 22 Bcf per well. And the wells are projected to cost approximately $5.3 million each. Again, all of these well costs that are referred to include all of the facilities. Similar to the pad in the presentation, we can go back to this pad and drill additional top-tier wells along with wells on offsetting pads in the future.", "In the wet area, we turned a four-well pad averaging 6,964-foot laterals to sales in the fourth quarter of 2015. This pad is in a similar area as the wet area pad on the presentation on page 41 where we went back and drilled additional wells. This four-well pad is projected to average 4 Bcf equivalent per 1,000 feet, or approximately 28 Bcf equivalent per well. Wells like these in this area would be projected to cost approximately $5.8 million today.", "In the super-rich area, we brought on-line two pads with 10 wells in the first quarter with an average lateral length of 5,100 feet. These wells are currently projected to average approximately 2.8 Bcf equivalent per 1,000 foot, or 14 Bcf equivalent per well, costing $4.8 million.", "On the last couple of calls, we've discussed the unique advantage we have due to our expansive inventory of existing pads and infrastructure, which allows us to drill wells at much lower cost, thereby significantly increasing capital efficiencies. Today I'd like to touch on another advantage. Currently, we have an inventory of over 230 pads that we could eventually utilize. This is comprised of new pads, pads that are in various stages of execution, 124 producing pads with five or fewer wells, and 59 producing pads with six to nine wells. All of these represent opportunities to drill more laterals.", "We could go back onto the pads as needed when there's room in the gathering system and the infrastructure would be ready. We have in hand today all the permits necessary to drill 42 laterals on those pads if desired. This is critical when you consider our ability to quickly ramp up activity and volumes at much less cost than others that don't have a deep acreage and existing pad inventory. Consider in Pennsylvania the cycle time for a grassroots multi-well pad and all the permitting that goes with it; civil engineering, environmental permitting and title can take a long time.", "On the execution front, from the start of the pad and road construction to turned-in line is around nine months for a four-well pad. For wells on an existing pad with permits in hand, that cycle time can be less than half that, depending on the number of wells. We believe this represents one of our greatest advantages and well positions us for future growth, and we believe it allows us to allocate our capital towards projects that will come on-line to sales in short order.", "While our 2017 plans are still under development, the important things to consider are that we have a large core and high-quality position, our acreage is largely held by production, a low-cost structure, strong capital efficiency, we're drilling longer laterals, we have an attractive low-cost transportation portfolio, the ability to drill on existing pads as well as new pads, permits in hand to quickly and efficiently grow when the time is right, the flexibility of drilling in dry or liquids-rich areas, a low decline base production corporately of 19%, very low maintenance CapEx, and finally, strong operations and technical teams with a proven track record. Most importantly, we will continue to allocate capital to our highest-return projects across our large core, diverse and stacked pay portfolio as we develop plans for 2017 and beyond.", "Switching to marketing for a few minutes, year-to-date, local Appalachia basis remains challenged. The good news is we have a portfolio of low-cost take-away capacity to markets that improve our price realizations. Later this year, during the fourth quarter, we will add to our portfolio 150 million a day of firm capacity on the Spectra Gulf Markets project at a very reasonable transport fee.", "Additionally, we anticipate the Columbia Leach/Rayne Xpress project to be in service by the end of 2017, which adds an additional 300 million a day in capacity. Both of these projects move our gas away from Appalachia to better prices in the Gulf Coast where demand is projected to dramatically increase over the next several years. As Jeff mentioned in his comments, once the Gulf Markets project is in service, approximately 70% of our natural gas production is projected to be sold outside the Appalachian Basin. Once Leach/Rayne Xpress is in service, over 80% of our natural gas will be sold outside the basin.", "We recently signed new condensate sales agreements which will improve our price by several dollars per barrel over first-half realized prices. On the NGL side, Mariner East began officially flowing ethane and propane to Marcus Hook on May 1. INEOS is loading their state-of-the-art Dragon-class ships with ethane and transporting it to Europe. And Range is marketing propane globally out of Marcus Hook and realizing prices above Mont Belvieu. These liquids marketing arrangements have significantly improved our NGL realizations compared to last summer, as reflected in our price realization improving to 24% of WTI compared to 14% of WTI last year.", "We also wanted to provide a brief update on our third Utica well, the DMC 10H, for which we are currently in the process of conducting a production flow test. The test is part of a larger technical evaluation to characterize the reservoir and help crack the code on this play. It's still very early in the producing lifecycle for this well, but it continues to produce with a flowing pressure and rate within the top four wells in the Utica, which is consistent with what we reported at the end of the first quarter.", "As I've said in the past, the Utica costs almost 2.5 times more than our dry Marcellus. And while the Utica represents tremendous future resource potential, even with anticipated efficiencies, the returns from our Marcellus wells currently exceed Utica returns. Given limited production history thus far, on a risk-adjusted basis, it's clear to us to that our high quality Marcellus wells are currently the superior investment. Our Utica potential is held by our Marcellus development, and over time we expect that the Utica can be a complementary development opportunity. But for now, our plan is to monitor our three wells, along with offset wells, while continuing to build our reservoir models and then determine the path forward from there.", "In the meantime, we'll remain focused on our high-graded Marcellus core acreage with the best economics possible. As we continue to lower cost, improve efficiencies, drill longer laterals and develop our stacked pay core assets, we remain well-positioned to create sustainable, long-term value.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials.", "Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Ray.", "The biggest second-quarter story on the finance side is the dramatic decrease in unit cost, led by a 44% year-over-year reduction in our water handling and processing costs, which is largely responsible for the record low $0.15 per Mcfe cash direct operating expense. We also saw meaningful reductions in contract pumping, well-head treatment costs and utilities.", "While not all of these cost reductions will be recurring, such as those attributable to the mild weather, the relentless focus on costs and the benefit of having shed significant non-core assets over the past year have moved our already low cost structure even lower. Aggregate unit costs were down by 8% or $0.24 per Mcfe from the second quarter of last year. Third quarter expense guidance found in the earnings release reflects our current view, which includes a significant drop in unit costs from prior guidance.", "It's amazing to note that six years ago in 2009 our DD&A rate per Mcfe and direct operating expense combined was $3.16 per Mcfe. The next year, 2010, was the first year that the combined costs fell below $3 per Mcfe, and three years later in 2013, the combined costs fell below $2 per Mcfe. With the current DD&A rate at $0.95 and cash operating expense at $0.15, we have reduced the combined expense of operating our properties and recovering our capital by 65% over the past seven years, and are nearing the $1 per Mcfe mark. As Jeff and Ray have both said, these cost and productivity improvements speak to the unique quality of our assets and execution capability of our team.", "Cash flow for the second quarter was $93 million and cash flow per fully diluted share was $0.56. Second quarter EBITDAX was $129 million, both slightly below the first quarter of this year. Year-to-date cash flow was $192 million and year-to-date EBITDAX was $264 million.", "Turning to the balance sheet, for the third consecutive quarter Range ended the quarter with less debt than it started. The last time our debt was below the current level was May of 2012, a period when our daily production was 50% less than the second quarter of 2016. Our bank credit facility, which has a $3 billion borrowing base and a $2 billion commitment amount, had only $3 million drawn at the end of the second quarter. Our existing committed liquidity is anticipated to be sufficient to fund potential cash requirements for the Memorial transaction, and once approved by shareholders, no bank group waivers or other consents are required to effect the merger.", "We continue to closely monitor our recycle ratio, as we believe it is a key forward-looking indicator of our ability to grow our reserves and production within unhedged future cash flow. Based on our year-end 2015 reserve report, F&D cost, projected 2016 unit cost structure, and unhedged NYMEX pricing for 2017, our recycle ratio is approximately two times.", "Though the recycle ratio I just mentioned is based on unhedged NYMEX prices, we remain well hedged in 2016, with over 80% of our remaining 2016 natural gas production hedged at a floor price of $3.22 per Mcfe and just over 330 MMBtu per day of our estimated 2017 gas production \u2013 it's hedged at $2.94 per Mcfe. We've also added hedges to our oil and NGL position, which are detailed in the earnings release and company website.", "In summary, from a revenue and profitability perspective, second quarter proved to be a lackluster story for us and the rest of the E&P industry, with low natural gas, oil and NGL prices coming off a mild winter and high energy inventories. Fortunately, industry production is declining and summer demand is upon us. NYMEX 2017 natural gas futures prices are much higher than 2016 historical prices, and our significant cost reductions and continued capital productivity improvements provide an added tailwind as we move into the last half of 2016.", "With the new Mariner East marketing arrangements up and running and new take-away capacity coming on later in the fourth quarter, we will be entering 2017 well positioned for a future of disciplined capital-efficient growth, with the opportunity to accelerate as warranted.", "Jeff, back to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Ventura. The question-and-answer session will now begin. And our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Jeff, it's interesting you described the quarter \u2013 or Roger described the quarter as lackluster. But the outlook is obviously still fairly \u2013 could be whatever you want it to be in terms of growth rates. And I know I ask this question a lot, but what's the expanded asset base? Can you just help guide us a little bit as to how you think about where the balance sheet ranks relative to the two major new areas that you're going to have in the expanded portfolio? And do we think about Range getting back to the sort of legacy 20%-plus growth rate that you used to talk about? Just if you could frame how management's thinking about a longer-term picture.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me start shorter-term and then move out longer-term. But I think we've got, I think, two really high-quality assets and I would argue they're the two best gas assets in the U.S., with room to improve both marketing advantages, location, the whole thing \u2013 where the infrastructure is; differentials on Memorial, all those types of things, really positive. And the ability \u2013 not only are they good, but we think we can make them better. So we're in good shape this year.", "But I think when you look forward, I think a couple of things will happen. One, I think you'll see continued improvement as we go forward. And we've got a great track record of doing that. It's really early. And Doug, as you know, we don't set our 2017 capital budget until December. But when we look at current forecasts and current strip pricing, where things are today, with our current estimates, we think the combined company would have an organic growth rate of about 10%, while spending at or near cash flow.", "As we project forward, we believe \u2013 for some of the reasons that I've said, and I won't go into detail unless somebody wants me to \u2013 but if you look in our IR slides, there's a series of slides looking at gas production in the U.S., both supply and demand. And we think when you look at supply and demand, there's a good story brewing for gas: gas production declining, we're in the highest-quality pieces, but oil, gas \u2013 associated gas with oil declining at a time when gas demand is growing. And personally, and I think our team believes, gas is a cleaner, better fuel. So as you look forward and as gas demand grows, and I think your company's deck shows it, gas prices as you go out look better. So as our cash flow increases, we have the ability to reinvest and reinvest quickly, and to ramp up with increased cash flow as gas prices improve.", "So right now, looking at where strip currently is, realizing strip is a bad predictor for our future prices, but even where strip is, I think next year somewhere around $3.10, that's organic growth of about 10%, allocated \u2013 and both sides can grow. Both sides, so I think the Memorial and Range both have strong economics right now. We see they're probably about equal. We expect to invest cash flow in both, and both can get organic growth of about 10% at strip prices for next year. As prices improve and we have the ability, cash flow increases, we can \u2013 our \u2013 we have plenty of places to drill to be able to ramp to get back to higher growth rates when prices warrant. So it was kind of a long-winded answer, but hopefully I answered your question.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, it's \u2013 spending within cash flow I think is the piece I was really trying to get at. So we should basically consider the balance sheet, the deleveraging of that obviously which occurs at the end of this year, are you then comfortable that the balance sheet is where you want it to be? I just kind of want to see how that ranks relative to your growth aspirations.", "Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Doug, this is Roger. I'll take that one. And first of all, I just want to mention that my comment was that from a revenue and profitability perspective, it was a lackluster quarter. I think from an operations and cost control standpoint, it was a terrific quarter. I just want to make that clarification.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Right.", "Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "But as for the balance sheet...", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's kind of what I was getting at. Right.", "Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay. As for the balance sheet, I mean, we're real happy with where we sit right now. As I mentioned, debt is lower at the end of the quarter than the beginning, three consecutive quarters running. Aggregate debt lowest it's been in four years, even though production continues to grow healthily. I think you're looking at a balance sheet where, with the Memorial transaction, the leverage ratio, that's EBITDAX, will be well below four, and I think that's where it needs to be. And with positive recycle ratios of two times for both companies on an unhedged basis, what that's telling me is that we'll be able to grow within cash flow powerfully, and have the optionality to either bring the leverage down if that's what's called for, or expand growth if that's what's the better option.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, fellas. I'll let someone else jump on. Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond with Simmons Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Roger S. Manny - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "My first question is, it looks like you're completing eight more wells this year, just curious what's driving that? And I assume that's not going to have an impact on your 2016 production, but is going to certainly help your 2017 trajectory.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. It's a good question, Pearce. And a lot of it is the operational efficiency and the reductions in capital that we're seeing. What I talked about for the water: $18 million savings; $9 million worth of savings in facilities. It's what we do every year, is we take those improvements, and whether it's drilling more feet of lateral for less cost, or whether it's fracking more stages in a day, or combined with the fact that the wells continue to do better than we project and flatter declines and shifting more to dry. All of that stuff helps us optimize our capital allocation, if you want to look at it that way.", "And what we generally end up doing is we either drill more wells, complete more wells on the end of the schedule, which means we may turn those wells, those eight more wells in line, but they'll probably be really close to the end of the year, which really impacts our growth in 2017 and helps set that up much better. So that's typically what happens every year.", "Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Well thanks for that, Ray. And then my follow-up, this is maybe a harder question to answer, but if we look at the forward gas strip, 2018 NYMEX is trading about $0.10 to $0.20, $0.15 below 2017. I'd love to get you guys' thoughts on that. Do you think that's the market basically saying, hey, in 2017 the industry is going to overdo it like it has done in the past and is really going to hurt 2018? What might the market be missing when you look out there? And does that affect any of your hedging plans?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think a key thing to look at, and there's been multiple studies and people have done it, is when you look at the forward strip and then you look at what actually occurs at that point in time, whether it's six months out, two, three, five years, and the strip is an extremely poor predictor of the future. So I think again, if you look forward, and we have stuff in our IR presentation, there's a lot of natural gas demand coming. I think power generation, ultimately long-term I think gas is going to be \u2013 continue to take market share. It's a cleaner, better fuel regardless of which administration gets in or what the laws are. It's just a better fuel.", "Gas exports to Mexico have surprised to the upside; I think that will continue to happen. LNG exports, we think at least eight B's (39:09) per day go, and that's already started up. A lot of petrochemical demand coming on in 2017, 2018. And I think once the infrastructure gets built and gas starts moving around, it's a cleaner, better fuel. Roger just went to a little symposium with a high-powered professor from a university. He puts in differently. He says the world's moving to \u2013 will move to lighter molecules. Basically, there's gas, C1H4. There's more hydrogen atoms per carbon atom than there is for coal or oil or other fuels. It's a cleaner, better fuel. So I think the strip is just a poor predictor of the future.", "Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Thank you very much, Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.", "Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Yeah, hi. Slide 11, 2018 FT capacity, do you have a guide as to what that might look like?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I'm not sure exactly what the question is. Well, I'm on slide 11, but...", "Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Yeah. So 2017 is an average of 1.375. Do you have an 2018? Early look?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, we...", "Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development", "It'll be the same. This is \u2013 Subash, this is Chad. On slide 11, you see average for 2017 is 1.375 Bs a day. 2018 will be the same, because that number includes Rover at the end of the year.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "The...", "Chad L. Stephens - Senior Vice President-Corporate Development", "It's average. So it would be higher, yes.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. It actually goes up some, because Rover comes on line right at the end of the year. So this is a yearly average. So our yearly average would be higher and going up. I think the other thing our marketing guys have done a good job of is, we have kind of right-sized firm transportation, plus we were a first mover, so we have right-sized transportation at a lower cost than our peers. And I think we still think ultimately, long-term, capacity tends to get overbuilt in the basin. So we didn't over-buy. So I think we're in good shape for our projection. It's a good match of transportation to our growth profile and what we have.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. And it's a very diverse set of take-away capacity, so that we're not dependent upon any one particular project, be it on time or not. I mean, we believe that all the projects we've got, looking at us going forward, are definitely on time, but we're not totally dependent upon any one of them. So I think our team has done an excellent job of spreading that out in that diverse portfolio.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "On slide 11, another key part of that bottom line. As transportation, as gas continues to move out of the basin, again, at the end of 2016, over 70% and at the end of 2017, over 80%, it's probably closer to 85% when Rover kicks on. You can see our \u2013 the estimated Marcellus differential to NYMEX improves. So we expect improving natural gas prices, better differentials, better net-backs going forward as we continue to move gas out of the basin. A lot of that incremental capacity goes to the Gulf Coast where the demand's going to be. And I think it's important to note as well on our NGLs, we only had a partial year, really; Mariner East started up May 1.", "Unknown Speaker", "First quarter.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Partial quarter. Partial year. So as you look into 2017, the pricing should get better for NGLs as well. We'll have a full year of Mariner East. We have a new condensate agreement, I think Ray mentioned, so we'll have a full year of that. The other thing is, again, we expect natural gas prices to get better going forward. But there's a good story brewing for NGLs as well. A lot of ethane demand coming on, Range being the first company to export ethane by ship with \u2013 in partnership with Sunoco and INEOS.", "But Enterprise is starting to export a lot of ethane later this year, coupled with all the petrochemical demand that comes on in 2017 and 2018. So the U.S. is the biggest propane exporter, will be a large ethane exporter. And increasing demand. So there's good story brewing, not just for natural gas but for NGLs and for, specifically, for Range because of the specific agreements we have. Then back to the macro as more ethane comes out of the gas stream, it helps a little bit on the supply side as you take the ethane out of the gas stream.", "Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "All right. If I could just ask you about Northeast Marcellus, the volumes were down. Understandably, there were no completions. I suspect that goes back into growth mode. And I guess what I'm getting at is, as you look at the optionality of your portfolio, should we read the increase in take-away as a desired growth rate over time? Or do you think of de-emphasizing Northeast Marcellus over time to where you really want more optionality instead of growth, if you have to rank one versus the other?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well I think if we rank anything it'd be returns. So we're not focused on growth as much as we're focused on returns. Growth just kind of falls out of that. Having a portfolio is good and having multiple choices is good, but it's a combination of where do we think we're going to get best returns with time. And we'll allocate capital that way. And when we close on Memorial, it will give us another good choice because there's high returns there. So we'll have the ability in the Marcellus Northeast, Southwest. We'll have the ability of what drives super-rich. We'll have the ability of Lower Cotton Valley. And I think having more high-quality choices ultimately will result in stronger returns with time.", "Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.", "Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Sorry. The three pads you highlighted with the EUR projections look to be around 20% to 30%-plus better versus your average curves in those areas. I think you mentioned two of them being near existing pads, and having permits to drill 42 more wells on existing pads. Is that the opportunity set for this type of high grade drilling in the near term? Or to what extent can you high-grade further in 2017 and 2018 to your best acreage where you'll find that kind of outperformance?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, that's a great question, Jeoffrey. And we're really doing that all the time. We're continuing to improve completion designs and targeting and reservoir modeling, and I think you've seen that quarter after quarter after quarter where we've continued to develop better and better well performance on a normalized basis, or however you want to look at it. We have lots of opportunities in all those areas mentioned. And remember, we have a huge position across southwest PA. And we talk about super-rich, wet and dry, and each one of those by their selves are larger than most of our peers' total position. And when you break those positions down internally, each one of those positions has lots of different unique designs and unique reservoir models and unique targets and all that.", "And so we're always trying to manage \u2013 trying to allocate our capital to the very highest return wells, but you also have to factor in the fact of, is there room in the gathering system to put more wells in that area? All of those things have to fit in; markets for how we're handling our firm transportation and all of those things work into this big master plan over the 5-year, 10-year outlook that we have. So I think you'll see, like we've done every year, I think our type curves will continue to improve. I think our averages improved.", "And what I was trying to get across in this \u2013 in my prepared remarks is that we have areas that are continuing to get better and better and are significantly above the average. And I think as we drill longer laterals and continue to improve our completion designs \u2013 I mean, we're 12 years into this and we're still finding better wells, and we're going back into some of those areas and doing that. And we have opportunities to drill brand new pads that in a lot of cases may have better economics than going back to an existing pad. It just depends on all of those things. So it's a good point, and yes, I think we are going to continue to drive things up well performance-wise, capital efficiency-wise. Cost structure is going to get better. You're going to continue to see those step changes year after year after year.", "Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for the detail.", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Uh-huh.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Good morning, guys. Say...", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "...Ray, you and Jeff and the guys seem to be highlighting a little bit more this time than in the past the return into some of the existing pads, like you mentioned on slide 42. I'm just wondering, how do you think about this just simply as far as improved potential well returns, and then versus the need to hold acres to drill? Because it certainly seems you have tremendous opportunity to come back and save costs and, obviously, improve returns here. So I'm just wondering, how do you balance this with the need to hold acreage?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, at the end of this year \u2013 we've talked about for the last several years how we had a pretty significant land budget. And I can't quote the numbers off the top of my head, but we've significantly reduced our land dollars over the last couple of years for sure. At the end of this year we finally reached that point where we're largely HBPed. There's always going to be a little bit of acreage out there, but it's largely done. We virtually have no acreage at risk at the end of this program this year. So going forward, that is much less of a factor than it's ever been. And so we will do what we've always done, is first look at returns and quality and room in the gathering system and all of those different things we need to look at.", "What \u2013 the point I'm trying to get across in talking about the existing pads is, we have an additional opportunity, and I believe a significant advantage over our peers in the area, in that we have all of that existing infrastructure that we can go back to. We, in fact, even have permits in hand, where we could almost instantly put rigs on those locations and in a couple of months have wells on-line. I think that's a very unique advantage. We're not saying that's exactly where we're going to go next year; I think you're just going to see a mix of that, plus new wells. We've also got some wells in brand new areas that are making four, four and a half Bcf per 1,000 foot, at $5 million in some cases.", "That's pretty impressive economics, and those wells will greatly compete with going back onto an existing pad. You can save up to $800,000 or $900,000 on a well on an existing pad. It still may not compete with some of these really prolific areas that we're able to develop today. So it's always a mix of allocating that capital amongst that. But the good news is, going forward, we don't have that anchor of needing to HBP acreage around our neck any further, now going forward.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Wow, that's great to hear. And then just a quick follow-up. Just on that slide 47 you guys talk about that third Utica well appearing to be not only one of your best, but obviously one of the best plays. Even with that said, you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks that these returns you don't think are still competing quite yet with some of these great Marcellus returns. So is it just simply a return question to decide when you start or if you start drilling more Utica wells, given you are holding that with Marcellus? I guess my question is, are you looking at just simply returns, or is there more to that?", "Ray N. Walker - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "It's basically that, returns. We think we could do an 8,500-foot lateral in the Utica today for about $14 million. But again, that's two and a half times more cost for essentially the same reserves as our dry Marcellus, some of the really prolific stuff we're developing in the very same area. So we have a huge inventory of Marcellus left to do. We have hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands, of wells to drill. And so I think that it really is going to be a matter of returns. We're going to continue to look at it. We may or may not drill a well next year. We haven't made those plans yet. But I think we'll continue to develop the reservoir models.", "And I think there will be a point in time where it will definitely be a complementary development. You'll see us kicking that in, whether it's a new contract to sell gas somewhere or whatever. But I think that for the current time, it's just simply, it can't compete with the Marcellus today for us. I think if you don't have Marcellus like we have and that's all you got, then that's what you do.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "That makes sense. Great details. Thanks, Ray.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Good morning. Hey, just a quick follow-up on ...", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "... an earlier question about the improved productivity per lateral foot in each of those areas you highlighted. How does that compare with your comment, Jeff, about able to grow about 10% out of \u2013 while being internally funded? In other words, is that growth within your cash flows based on what your average 2016 program is? Or \u2013 and do those results point to even a better 2017 to 2019 growth profile because of that recoverability?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. It's a good point. What I said in there is, I said based on our current forecasts and utilizing current strip pricing, we'd get growth of about 10%, spending at or near cash flow. As we continue to see improvements with time \u2013 and you're talking about going out there to 2018, 2019 and beyond \u2013 I expect \u2013 I agree with Ray. I think we're not at the end of our efficiency.", "So I think as we continue to extend laterals and optimize and hone in on better areas and infrastructure build-out, all those things, I think we can get better with time. All of that would allow for increased cash flow for the same dollars spent, which would allow us to either accelerate production and growth rate or balance sheet or whatever we choose to do with that. But again, we also expect gas markets and NGL markets to improve with time, so that would say that we've got strong returns that we think will get significantly better into the future.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Great. And then with the purchase expected to close towards the end of this quarter, but the slides you added on the over-pressured Lower Cotton Valley, really highlighting that position seems more expensive than just the Terryville field, is just \u2013 also in terms of foreshadowing, any comments on what the increased Lower Cotton Valley commentary can mean?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, that's a good question, Ron. Yeah. We're \u2013 we think Terryville is a great field and there's a lot of additional drilling to do there, a stacked pay potential. And just like we've been able to improve the Marcellus with time, and believe we still can, we think that there's things we can do to improve the different intervals in Terryville. So both high-quality fields. But your point's a good one that it's not just that, the Terryville, but there's 220,000 net acres that comes with Memorial, so that's a big footprint in a big position. And importantly, it's anchored by a couple of really high-quality fields, so Terryville in the North and Vernon field towards the south of that position.", "And Vernon field, actually, production-wise, is better than Terryville in that the vertical wells were significantly better \u2013 in fact, so good that it was developed on a vertical basis. But at the point being, when you look at Terryville, Vernon and in addition, across that 220,000 acres, there's a number of vertical tests, and they show multiple things. One, with all that well control, vertical well control, it shows that those high-quality sands that exist in Terryville and in Vernon are present really across that 220,000 acres. So the sands are present and they're good quality. Another thing, when you look, there's multiple gas tests out there in those vertical wells. So not only is the sand present with good quality, it's also gas-saturated.", "And then I think another key concept that's true, really, in the industry is that a horizontal well is a multiplier of a vertical. For instance, in the Marcellus, the old vertical wells, if they averaged in an area 0.5 Bcf per well and then in the horizontals you pumped a total of 30 stages, in essence then, 0.5 Bs times 30 stages, you end up with a 15 Bcf well. And we see in the Terryville area, not just from Terryville, but from some other fields in the area that it's the same thing where you have, that the horizontal is multiplier of a vertical and if you've got good vertical production in the fort, it should lead to good horizontal wells. Bottom line, we think there's significant potential, not only in Terryville, but we think there's significant upside to the 220,000 acres that comes with it.", "Operator", "Due to technical difficulties on the part of their service provider, Range Resources has elected to end the call at this time.

This call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Statements contained in this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.", "After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President, Investor Relations at Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's third quarter earnings call. The speakers on the today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Chief Financial Officer.", "Hopefully, you've had a chance to review the press release and updated Investor Presentation that we posted on our website. We also filed our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.", "Before we begin, let me also point out that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. In addition, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of these non-GAAP measures and to provide more details on both natural gas and NGL pricing.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, Laith. We are excited that we closed our merger with Memorial on September 16. The integration of the teams and the assets is going very well. Range now is a better, stronger company with strong teams and high quality assets in both our Marcellus Shale division and the new North Louisiana division.", "I'll begin by reviewing what Range accomplished during the quarter, and then I'll discuss some of the key attributes we have that I believe set us up for success. Range's ability to consistently drill low cost, high return wells across our acreage in the Marcellus as well as focus on driving down unit costs resulted in solid operating results for the third quarter. And due to the closing date, 15 days of solid performance from the North Louisiana team were represented in the quarterly numbers.", "The third quarter took us one step closer to seeing meaningful improvements in realized prices across all of our products. First, all three of our liquids projects were on line during the quarter: ATEX, Mariner West and Mariner East. We sold ethane to Europe, Canada and to the Gulf Coast, and exported propane from Marcus Hook into international markets. The net effect is that our NGL price increased from 13% of WTI to 25% of WTI on a year-over-year basis.", "Second, we have a new condensate sales agreement which \u2013 agreements, which commenced on July 1. These agreements improved our corporate condensate realizations from a $13 differential to WTI, to a $6 differential to WTI on a year-over-year basis, in a similar improvement compared to the second quarter of this year.", "Third, NYMEX gas prices were higher in the third quarter, and all of the gas pipelines we are contracted on are expected to be on schedule. This includes Spectra's Gulf Markets Expansion, which came on line earlier this month on October 4. This transportation allows us to move an additional 150 million cubic feet per day of our Marcellus production to the Gulf Coast. Like the Uniontown, the Gas City pipeline, which became operational this time last year, this project immediately improves our expected Marcellus netbacks.", "The next two projects for Range are Columbia's Leach/Rayne XPress and ETP's Rover Phase 2, both of which have received FERC's final EIS approval, and both of which we understand will be operational in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result of this increased transport and our growing North Louisiana production, we expect to see corporate natural gas differentials improving to approximately $0.46 next quarter based on current strip pricing, and approximately $0.33 in 2017. All else being equal, these improved netbacks should improve margins substantially in 2017, and we expect further improvements in 2018.", "Let me turn to North Louisiana and give an update there. The integration, as I mentioned earlier, is going very well and the North Louisiana division is accomplishing a lot. Let me give a few examples.", "First, we just set a record for the fastest spud to rig release of any well drilled to date in Terryville field and then repeated that record with the second well. In addition, we just completed one of the best producing wells ever drilled in the field to date. Our purchasing department has also made good progress and we're achieving cost reductions on that front as a result. Ray will talk more specifically about these accomplishments and improvements in a few minutes.", "The North Louisiana team has also had some early success refining the targeting and landing in the Lower Cotton Valley. As an example, they just finished drilling some wells that were entirely within a much tighter target within the Upper Red. Once we complete the wells, we'll see what affect this has on performance.", "It's early, but we're also excited about the North Louisiana extension areas. The team has drilled the pilot holes for the first three extension wells, while testing new areas several miles away from Terryville and far away from each other, based on extensive logs, cores and shows, all three vertical pilots look very encouraging. In addition, we have drilled and cased the horizontal laterals on two of the three pilot holes. Again, the results to date look encouraging. The third lateral is currently being drilled.", "We expect to have all three wells drilled, completed and tested by the end of this year. The results of the wells will help provide additional data regarding the extension areas that will be rolled into our planning for 2017 and 2018.", "On a macro level, there are signs that later this year and into 2017, supply and demand will be more balanced and pricing could improve. We expect natural gas production in the U.S. to continue declining for the remainder of the year. Based on available data, it appears 2016 will be the first time that natural gas production will decline on the year-over-year basis since 2005. This supply decline is happening while demand for natural gas is increasing, driven by Mexican exports, power generation and LNG exports.", "Looking towards 2017, the NYMEX Strip has moved above $3 and we think it can continue to climb. Based on where strip pricing is today, we believe that we can grow the combined company at 33% to 35% for 2017. This equates to an organic growth rate of 11% to 13% for 2017, coupled with the full year of the North Louisiana division versus roughly a quarter in 2016.", "Importantly, this preliminary plan for 2017 also results in strong growth for 2018, assuming a $3.25 per mcf and $60 per barrel, we are projecting that we should achieve organic growth for 2018 of approximately 20%. We believe that Range's Marcellus and Lower Cotton Valley assets are two of the lowest cost gas plays in the United States, which results in a resilient and flexible platform for sustained growth.", "This combination creates a unique portfolio that is strategically located near key demand centers with more optionality for Range and an enhanced ability to serve our end customers. The product mix in both assets are similar, which enables us to utilize our marketing expertise for both natural gas and NGLs, and leverage our existing customer and transport relationships to find innovative sales arrangements just as we've done in the past.", "In summary, we believe that Range offers investors five key positive attributes. The first is a very high quality, low cost asset base in two very complementary basins. The second is improved capital efficiency as illustrated by the opportunity to go back onto existing pads to drill new wells in the Marcellus and to drill highly prolific wells in the Lower Cotton Valley. Continuing to drill longer laterals and optimizing landing and targeting will also drive improved capital efficiency in both regions.", "The third key attribute is top tier operational execution as evidenced by a consistent track record of operational achievements. The fourth is a strong marketing effort, highlighted by Range's ability to sell its products into multiple markets, enhanced by our newly acquired North Louisiana assets, and demonstrated in our expecting pricing improvements across all products heading into the fourth quarter of 2016 and further into 2017.", "Finally, Range has an even stronger balance sheet with ample liquidity and a strong hedge position for the remainder of 2016 and 2017. All of these attributes position Range to deliver strong operating results and build sustainable long-term shareholder value. I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff. We continue to execute in the Marcellus and are already achieving significant wins in North Louisiana.", "Production for the third quarter came in at 1.51 Bcf equivalent per day, and for the fourth quarter, we're setting guidance at 1.85 Bcf equivalent per day. Excluding the asset sales and the North Louisiana volumes, we expect to grow 10% over last year, as previously guided, while maintaining our capital expenditure level at approximately $495 million. And importantly, we plan to end 2016 with an exit rate higher than last year, setting us up well for 2017 and beyond.", "We continue to make great strides in unit cost reductions, and this is something that we're really proud of. Specifically driving this improvement, in the Southern Marcellus, we've seen a 35% reduction in LOE year-to-date versus the average for 2015. This was achieved through three key areas: one, leveraging service cost with our long-term vendor relationships; two, reductions in third-party manpower; and three, the savings associated with our water handling through our water logistics team, which gets water from our production pads to our frac operation quicker than ever.", "Staying with our Marcellus activity, capital efficiency continues to improve, and I'll review some examples from our operations in Southwest Pennsylvania.", "On the water front, we've continued the improvements that we discussed on the last call, and we'll reduce our capital expenditures for water by over $20 million this year. We've reduced the total average completion cost per foot of lateral by 20% as compared to last year. Our top three pads completed in 2016 have averaged over 8.5 stages a day for a total of 432 stages. The best pad achieved a completion cost per foot of almost 23% below the average, which again was already 20% lower than last year.", "We're forecasting a 16% reduction in CapEx for production facilities, resulting in almost $6 million in savings this year as a result of design improvements, reductions in labor and material, and redeployment of existing equipment.", "On the drilling side, we've achieved a 5% reduction in drilling costs per foot compared to last year, and 8 of our top 10 best days for lateral feet drilled in a day have been this year. This illustrates that we're still improving and expect to continue to improve going forward.", "As we've covered many times in the past, we believe our average total well cost per foot, including facilities, are the best in the southwest portion of the basin. We believe if you look at some of our recent achievements, which are clearly more than just a few wells, you'll begin to appreciate the improving capital efficiency that we expect to see going forward. Again, all of this being done safely and in an environmentally sound manner by a strong operations and technical team, and by all our folks across the company.", "Today, we can drill a 9,000-foot lateral and complete it with 45 stages in our wet area with full facilities on a new build, four well pad, for approximately $7.2 million per well. In comparison to our peers, our cost is less; in fact, over $1 million less on an apples-to-apples basis. And our well performance is better, resulting in better economics.", "I should point out that this is not just theoretical. We have many of these types of longer lateral wells planned for the future. Like I reported on the last call, we are now drilling a seven well pad in our super-rich area, averaging approximately 10,700-foot laterals, with the longest at 14,500 feet. These wells will be completed early next year, and we look forward to sharing the results of these and other long lateral pads in the future.", "I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through some of our recent top performing wells during the third quarter. But before I do that, I want to remind everyone that these rates will all be reported as constrained actual rates to sales. In our dry area, a four well pad with an average lateral length of 5,300 feet and 28 stages per well was completed, and had an average 24-hour rate to sales of 20 million cubic feet equivalent per day.", "In our wet area, two pads showed excellent results: a four well pad with an average lateral length of 6,800 feet and 35 stages produced at 22 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well; and a six well pad with an average lateral length of 4,500 feet and 23 stages produced at 19 million cubic feet equivalent a day per well.", "On the last couple of calls, we've also discussed our unique advantage of the expansive inventory of existing pads and infrastructure, which allows us to drill wells at lower cost, thereby increasing capital efficiencies while allowing us to ramp up quicker than any of our peers. Currently, we have an inventory of over 230 pads that we could eventually utilize. This is comprised of new pads, pads that are in various stages of execution, 124 producing pads with five or fewer wells, and 59 producing pads with six to nine wells. All of these represent opportunities to drill more laterals at very attractive cost.", "Although it's early in the planning process, in southwest Pennsylvania, our current plans have us drilling about a third of our wells on existing pads in 2017. That number could increase to as much as half of our wells in 2018. Our average drilled lateral length in 2017 is planned to be over 8,000 feet, and our expectation is the 2018 average lateral length will be longer. Again, these are early estimates and will most certainly change over time. What's important is that we have the ability to drill longer laterals, drill on existing pads, and we have permits in hand with infrastructure in place to yield further improving capital efficiencies going forward.", "Shifting now to North Louisiana, the integration is going very well. We'll be operating those assets out of our new North Louisiana division office in Houston under the direction of John Applegath, Senior Vice President of the new North Louisiana division, who has relocated there to Houston from our Southern Marcellus division office in Pittsburgh. Dennis Degner, now Vice President of the Southern Marcellus division, stepped up to take over the Southern Marcellus Shale division. We are extremely proud of both of these gentlemen and their accomplishments. Their record is clear, and through their leadership, we expect continued improvements in capital efficiency, coupled with improving well performance in both areas.", "When we originally evaluated the Memorial assets, our expectations were that we could improve on the already impressive results they have seen there. For example, we thought there was potential in terms of drilling times and costs, coupled with improvements in well performance by optimizing the target window and staying in zone, all of which should result in improved efficiencies and productivity over time.", "Even though we've only had the reins for approximately six weeks, as Jeff referred to in his remarks, John and the new team are already achieving some significant wins. We just set the record for spud to rig release in Terryville of 30 days and have now repeated it on a second well. To date this year, for wells averaging more than 5,000 feet of lateral length, the average has been 40 days. This 25% improvement in efficiency was achieved by implementing more aggressive bits and high speed, high differential motors.", "A lot of these ideas, and many more coming, are the result of us bringing in Scott Chesebro as our new Vice President of Drilling. Scott has a ton of experience in high pressure, high temperature drilling across the world, and was actually involved in the vertical drilling in the Vernon field. We expect Scott and his new team will be able to significantly improve drilling performance and costs as we go forward.", "And the last batch of wells that were completed, we also saw one of the highest productive wells in Terryville to date. It had a 30-day IP to sales of 4.7 million cubic feet equivalent per day per thousand foot, or over 27 million cubic feet equivalent per day, which is 68% higher than the average. We believe this is a real testament to both the team and the quality of the rock in Terryville, and clearly illustrates that there is more potential yet to be unlocked as we further develop the Upper Red along with the stacked pay opportunities in the Terryville field. Like I've said many times over the years in the Marcellus, I don't believe we've drilled our best well yet in Terryville.", "We've also had a quick win on targeting. When drilling in the Upper Red prior to Range, the target for the lateral ranged from 100 to 125 feet thick, encompassing most of the reservoir. We believe there may be significant performance improvements by incorporating an approach where we target only the best porosity interval, which is 20 to 40 feet thick,, and then stay in that much target window for 100% of the lateral. We've already accomplished this on a few wells and expect to announce those results next year when those wells are completed.", "Bringing to bear the supply chain advantages of Range has also resulted in an early win. For example, we've already saved 7% in casing costs resulting in savings of over $50,000 per well, and we expect that there will be many examples of this going forward.", "As illustrated in these few early examples, we believe strongly that we can lower cost, improve well performance, improve operational efficiencies, and lower our unit cost while working safely and being good stewards of the environment in the communities where we live and work. We will bring to bear our operating philosophy of steady and strategic planning, implementing innovative and sound technologies and processes that have worked for us in the Marcellus, while putting in place a long-term approach focused on economic and value-enhancing growth.", "Like Jeff mentioned, we're currently working on the three extension area wells. Two of the wells are in the completion phase and the third well is nearing completion of the drilling phase. We expect to be able to have initial results from these three wells before year-end.", "Looking at the data collected thus far, the Upper Red sands in these wells have an average gas in place concentration \u2013 that is Bcf per vertical foot \u2013 that is on par with the Upper Red in the very best part of Terryville. And they're twice as thick, yielding twice the gas in place as the Upper Red sands in Terryville.", "The Lower Red sands have an average gas in place concentration nearly three times that of the best lower red in Terryville. Considering these wells are deeper and have a higher pressure gradient, we interpret the high reservoir pressure, better gas in place, and the favorable reservoir parameters to be cause for optimism regarding these areas in the basin.", "Of course, we won't know for sure until we see the actual production from the wells. But one of the many things that our technical team has learned, especially after drilling and analyzing the early data from these expansion wells, coupled with our analyses of the existing producing fields and the more than 50 vertical tests throughout the acreage, is that the Lower Cotton Valley sands in this portion of the basin are fairly consistent, giving us support for our optimism. Even so, this does not take into account the other two to three horizontal targets available throughout the acreage.", "Shifting back to the Terryville field. Both Red zones and both Pink zones have been tested to date, along with further development in the Upper Red, which has been the primary target. We'll also be looking at the Lower Red and the Deep Pinks going forward. We see a lot of value in the stacked pay development, and combined with lower cost, are encouraged about the future potential in Terryville, along with the extension areas.", "For 2017, we'll enter the year with approximately 25 drilled and uncompleted well bores in North Louisiana, which we plan to complete in the first quarter. This will result in outsized production growth early next year, and to what we think will be a stronger pricing environment. As we smooth out the completion activity going forward, I believe we'll have a Range-like approach of steady quarter-over-quarter growth in North Louisiana as we enter 2018.", "Switching to marketing for a few minutes. In addition to improving net backs in the updates that Jeff discussed during his remarks, I'd like to re-emphasize a couple of points before I close. There have been a lot of questions about pipeline projects in Appalachia. Are they on time and what impacts might they have on bases and so forth?", "Remember that Range was the first mover in the basin, and we've been working on a diversified and layered portfolio of transportation for many years. As Jeff discussed, we believe the projects that we are in are on time. We sell to multiple markets and have been consistent in our strategy since we discovered the Marcellus. One pipe doesn't make a big difference to Range as we've diversified our exposure over multiple pipes.", "Our 2017 natural gas differential is expected to improve by $0.10 to $0.15 based on current strip pricing. And our pricing is much more resilient, having multiple outlets and a large base of North Louisiana production. Again, we just acquired a world-class asset in North Louisiana that gets very close to NYMEX pricing and provides marketing and capital flexibility. So now one pipe makes even less difference.", "We set capital budgets at the beginning of every year, but capital is allocated on a real-time basis. Having two of the most economic plays in the U.S. is a unique advantage and we have the flexibility to allocate capital real time as conditions dictate. None of our peers in Appalachia have this option. As both our Southern Marcellus and North Louisiana divisions continue to improve on cost, efficiencies and performance, we expect there will be a lot of value as markets improve.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, Ray. I'm delighted to report the third quarter of 2016 is the quarter we have been waiting to talk about for a long time. Natural gas, NGL and oil sales before cash-settled derivatives was $304 million. That's 36% higher than the second quarter of this year. Cash flow at $123 million was 32% higher. EBITDAX at $160 million was 24% higher. And cash margin at $0.82 was 17% higher.", "Range has navigated this period of low commodity prices well. And by all measures, the third quarter of 2016 appears to mark a financial turning point for Range. Given that the third quarter includes only 15 days of operating results from the Memorial merger, we're excited that we have not only turned the proverbial corner but are now moving forward on a wider, unique and more prosperous new road.", "The reasons for our optimism and confidence in Range's path are multifold. We have attractive new optionality when deploying capital, production continues to steadily grow, the cost structure continues to improve, and the higher margin marketing and transportation arrangements we've spoken of in prior quarters are now fully operational, delivering the improved cash flow and margins we predicted.", "Year-to-date cash flow was $316 million, and year-to-date EBITDAX was $424 million. Fully diluted cash flow per share this quarter, which again includes only 15 days of cash flow from the Memorial merger, was $0.68 per share.", "Looking closer a the third quarter cost structure performance, the Range teams have continued to do a terrific job holding the line on cash direct operating expense, which at $0.16 per mcfe was roughly the same as last quarter and a 38% improvement from the third quarter of last year. All other unit cost items came in at or favorable to guidance, with the exception of interest expense, which was $0.04 over guidance due to nonrecurring transaction expenses associated with the successful senior subordinated note exchange, which I'll further discuss in a moment.", "The third quarter DD&A rate was $0.95 per mcfe, identical to the prior quarter, and 18% better than the third quarter of last year. And please reference the third quarter earnings release for full fourth quarter 2016 unit cost expense guidance.", "Moving to the balance sheet, investors will note many positive changes resulting from the Memorial merger. The third quarter debt to capitalization ratio improved from 49% at year-end 2015 to 41% at the end of the third quarter. Debt to rolling four quarter EBITDAX, including the Memorial debt and historical four quarters of their EBITDAX, was 3.6 times.", "The combined Range and Memorial balance sheet limit our debt to EBITDAX leverage to the mid 3 times range, with the ratio getting better next year as higher cumulative cash flow improves the ratio moving into 2018. By the end of 2018, we expect the debt to EBITDAX ratio to have declined at least a full turn from continued growth at or near cash flow.", "Our forward-looking recycle ratio remains above the 2 times level, as NYMEX prices have further strengthened and our marketing contracts and North Louisiana production allow us to move more of our products to higher margin sales points.", "The Memorial merger also provided an excellent opportunity to further advance our balance sheet structure. Pre-merger, Memorial had a partially funded, fully conforming $1 billion bank credit facility and $600 million in unsecured senior notes outstanding. Pre-merger, Range had a $3 billion bank credit facility with only $3 million outstanding against its $2 billion commitment amount. Range also had one issue of unsecured senior notes outstanding and three series of unsecured subordinated notes. The merger allowed Range to resimplify the company's debt structure into a single bank credit facility and a single tier of unsecured senior notes through our comprehensive bond exchange and tender offer. And here's briefly how it worked.", "The Memorial bank credit facility was canceled as the merger closed. The collateral was released and the outstanding balance was moved to the existing Range bank credit facility. Over 97% of the three series of Range subordinated notes were exchanged for like-rate and like-maturity Range senior notes. And the Memorial senior notes were exchanged into like-kind Range senior notes or redeemed for cash at the holder's option, with the majority of the Memorial senior note holders choosing to accept Range notes rather than cash.", "The exchange was very successful. The Range subordinated notes are now senior notes. The Range and old Memorial senior notes are now all pari passu Range senior obligations and share the same covenant package as the Range existing 2025 senior notes. This allows bond investors to trade freely across the entire rate and maturity spectrum without making structural credit adjustments due to price.", "The exchange allowed Range to utilize some of our low cost unused bank commitment while still providing close to $1 billion in committed liquidity. Following the exchange, all of the Range bonds traded at tighter spreads than before the exchange, in both Moody's and S&P, moved Range to stable outlook.", "While Range is not yet investment grade, the bond exchange aligns our balance sheet closer to what is expected of an investment grade company. My compliments to the Range finance team for completing this complex and highly successful series of transactions, which makes our balance sheet even easier to understand and positions us well for future growth and credit quality improvement.", "The Range hedge position was significantly enhanced by the Memorial merger with the post-merger hedge book holding higher hedged natural gas volumes and prices. Range also added hedge volumes across all of our products during the third quarter. Please reference the earnings release, third quarter 10-Q, and Range website for specific post-merger hedge volume and price information.", "In summary, the third quarter showed the fundamental improvements in top line revenue, cash flow and margins flowing through the Range financial statements that we have all worked so hard to achieve. With the financial statements reflecting only 15 days of Memorial ownership and the exciting results Ray just discussed in both Appalachia and North Louisiana, we look forward to continued operating and financial progress in the quarters ahead.", "Jeff, back to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Ventura. The question-and-answer session will now begin. And it looks like our first question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Gentlemen (33:12), my first question is just your broad thoughts on capital allocation between the Marcellus and Northern Louisiana as you think about 2017 and 2018. I think you're running four rigs in Terryville right now. So how are you thinking about capital allocation? I also wanted to see if you could maybe comment \u2013 I do know that MRD had some under-delivery on the PennTex systems. So that could provide an outlet for some kind of value-added growth thinking about the MVC's there.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. It's a good question. Again, I want to stress, when you look at 2017, we're projecting an organic growth rate of 11% to 13%. And really, that's an output from several different scenarios where we're allocating various percentages of capital between the Marcellus and North Louisiana. Again, I think it's a great question and a really important one because it highlights our ability to choose between two great assets, each near key market areas in the Northeast and in the Gulf Coast. Both areas we have the ability to ramp production and are expected to get good growth next year relative to 2016. And we can do that for a long time into the future.", "Another key thing, I think that's kind of a unique ability we have to react to upcoming changes in capital allocation, in my opinion, is a real advantage that Range has that other companies don't have, or a lot of peers don't have. So it's a function of several things. We've run multiple scenarios. And you're right, Arun, we think as we continue to grow and ramp volumes, which we expect to do in North Louisiana, that, that cost that you mentioned will come down significantly. With time, we can really drive down the processing and gathering costs.", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And just my follow-up, some intriguing comments just on capital efficiency gains in the Marcellus from longer laterals and using existing pads. Can you calibrate, perhaps, I don't know, on a percentage basis what that could do for your Marcellus program in terms of just capital efficiency in 2017 and 2018?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. When you look at the pads, we've got 230 existing pads out there. And I won't quote those numbers again that I went through in my remarks, but all of them represent tons and tons of opportunities to go back and drill laterals. We've literally got thousands of them we can do. With the infrastructure in place, of course, when you go back onto an existing pad, you don't have to build the pad, the road, meter taps, production facilities, the water infrastructure, all that stuff is already there.", "And you can see savings on a per well basis ranging from $200,000 up to \u2013 I mean there's one example in our presentation, for example, that's $850,000. And they're not all going to be $850,000, they're not all going to be $200,000. I think every case is going to be specific. But as we roll into 2017 and we see as much as a third of our wells potentially next year in our current plans today which, of course, will change, but when we look at it today, we see maybe a third of our wells next year on existing pads. That could move to as high as half of our wells potentially in 2018. And I think over time, you're going to see some major improvements to capital efficiency. But I would peg it, if you try to get back to a well-by-well basis, somewhere between that $200,000 to $400,000, $500,000 per well on average. Something like that.", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. And then you're also going to be drilling longer laterals as well, right?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yes. Yeah, we do expect...", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Can you remind me of the average lateral length in 2016?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "In 2016, I think our average drilled lateral length is probably around 7,000 feet or so. Next year we'll see that going up to 8,000 feet. Of course, our goal, like I've said in the past, is to continue to push those longer and longer. We believe in the liquids-rich areas, the wet and the super-rich, that around 8,000 feet might be optimum for us. In the dry, we see them closer to 10,000 feet on average as we drill into the future.", "Now, of course, the wells that we turn into line may be a little bit less length than the ones that we're actually drilling because remember, again, you just got the lag time of six, nine months to a year, in some cases, before the wells actually come on line. But they'll be stepping up right behind it year-over-year, getting longer just like the wells we're drilling.", "Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Pearce Hammond of Simmons Piper Jaffray.", "Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray", "Morning. And thanks for the helpful disclosure on 2017 and 2018 production growth. What would CapEx be roughly to drive that production growth?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "At or near cash flow.", "Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray", "And then, Jeff, what are you seeing on service costs on a leading edge basis? And what is your expectation for service costs inflation, if any, in 2017? And are you taking any steps to mitigate any of this potential inflation through maybe longer term contracts?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, Pierce. This is Ray. I'll tackle that. It's a great question. And clearly, we are at or near bottom, we think, in service prices, and I don't think anybody would disagree with that. I think that the way prices on the service and supply side move from this point forward depends on \u2013 it's going to be very regional, I'll say it that way. I think in areas potentially like West Texas and maybe the SCOOP/STACK areas and places like that where activity seems to have ramped up quite a bit more, you know you could see prices moving up. In the Marcellus, per se, we don't see it. We are entering into what we term long-term relationships, not necessarily contracts.", "I think contracts is a term that gets way over-used when talking about service companies because every contract's different and has different outs and different resets and you know everything else that people put in there. But we focus a lot on long-term relationships and we don't see any important or significant price increases going into 2017.", "It's a little hard to see past that yet because I think a lot of it depends on commodity prices and what we see there, and we're pretty excited about the future going forward. We've got two great plays. We can allocate capital freely back and forth between the two plays. We have organizations and opportunities in place to significantly ramp up both sides of that. And so I think that we have a ton of really high-class opportunities going forward, and I think we're going to be well positioned to adjust to whatever happens on the service side.", "Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray", "Thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America / Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, everybody, and thanks for the early look at the next couple of years. Ray, I guess \u2013 well, maybe Jeff wants to answer this \u2013 but I guess the question we're all trying to figure out is the returns on Terryville look like they're, on an apples-for-apples basis, better than the returns marginally in the Marcellus, given the differential challenges and so on. I realize you talked a little about allocation and relative rig counts, but how do you think about how far you would want to go in skewing the capital towards Terryville? Why wouldn't you go to the highest return assets in the portfolio now that you have that option?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Doug, I'd say if you look at the returns that are in our IR presentation on the website, and you look at them, they're actually close. Terryville was slightly better but they're very close. And one of the advantages we have again that a lot of our peers don't have, that are single-based and are focused is we can allocate capital back and forth. So as best as we can on a real-time basis, we'll be looking at making the best investment decisions we can. But we think that's an advantage we have that others don't.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America / Merrill Lynch", "I guess I was thinking more about the impact on basis differentials in terms of mix, Jeff. We've seen (42:19)", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Sure, I mean \u2013 yeah, right. And we have...", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America / Merrill Lynch", "(42:22)", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "The economics that are in there reflect the current strip and basis differentials for both areas, and yet the returns in those areas are close. To the extent that changes, we'll do our best to allocate to maximize value.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America / Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks for that. My follow up is hopefully a quick one. It's really on the condensate pricing improvement. I know you touched on this last quarter, but I'm just trying to understand, if you could walk us through to the \u2013 notwithstanding any confidentialities \u2013 how you were able to achieve a $7 bump in your realizations and whether that is sustainable going forward, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.", "Chad L. Stephens - Range Resources Corp.", "Doug, yeah. This is Chad Stephens. It's really a function of the purchaser has a lot of scale in the area, and they have some new assets that they needed feedstock for. And fortunately, our light crude serves the asset that they just put in service well, so it was a good fit.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America / Merrill Lynch", "So it is sustainable going forward?", "Chad L. Stephens - Range Resources Corp.", "Yes.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America / Merrill Lynch", "Great stuff. Well, I'll see you in a couple of weeks, guys. Thanks so much.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ron Mills of Johnson Rice.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Good morning, guys. Question on the extension areas of the Terryville field. Thanks for the cross-section showing the depth and the thickness, improving on the southern extension areas. The three extension tests, Jeff, you mentioned were spread across your position between the Driscoll/Vernon type areas or along that cross-section. Where about are you testing those extension areas?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "We haven't specifically disclosed where they are. That being said, I've seen different \u2013 I mean it's public data \u2013 and I've seen some people spot them up already. But I think the important part is, Ron, is \u2013 the point that you're making \u2013 is that they're far away from Terryville towards the southern edge, far apart from each other. So they're good tests of the 220,000 net acres, to start to look at what does the other acreage look like. The cross-section reflects the upside, and as you go south, it gets thicker. And as Ray mentioned, there's multiple fields in the area, plus 50 vertical wells across the acreage. It kind of gives you a feel for what that potential is.", "And, based on the \u2013 Ray mentioned with some detail, actually, not just say (45:08) they were encouraging, Ray gave you some feel to direct comparison back to Terryville in terms of the amount of gas in place and thickness and quality of the reservoir. But/and still we have \u2013 till you get the long-term tests, you don't know, but we're certainly encouraged by what we see, both the quality, quantity and where they're located.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "And is it fair to assume that \u2013 were these wells drilled with your design, with your lateral targeting? Just trying to get a sense as to the initial results, how they will be drilled versus what your plans are in terms of lateral targeting.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, Ron. I mean, the wells were cited by the Memorial team prior to Range really being involved. I mean, we were there but we weren't really in control at that point. And as far as picking the actual targets, where we put the horizontal laterals into, that was a real team decision and Range was very much driving the train and working with the Memorial team in that, and fully baked in, fully supportive of what they picked and we all agreed to that up front. So yeah, so we were heavily involved in the completions, and of course, the completion design is on our watch and we're executing those as we speak.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Perfect. And one last one in South Louisiana. Ray, the well you highlighted that came in about \u2013 it looks like it's almost 15% or 20% above the type curve you had used to evaluate the deal. I assume that well was drilled prior to the merger. I guess that's question number one. And the second part of that is what drove that outperformance, especially if it didn't have the benefit of such tight lateral targeting?", "Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.", "Yes, Ron, this is Alan. The well was completed prior to us taking over operations on it. Probably what drove the productivity of the well is the fact that it was completed 100% within the 100 foot target interval. So it was \u2013 just to kind of help put some color on this thing, it's a 4,700 foot lateral. So the 30-day IP, if you normalize it, would be 43 million cubic feet equivalent a day. That's why it's very impressive. So was it 100% within the target interval? Obviously, completion design continues to change over time, so some modifications were made there.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jon Wolff of Jefferies.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, guys.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Hey, Jon.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Very intrigued by the 230 existing well pads in Southwest PA you've talked about a little bit in the past. And I think you said a third of drilling would be on existing pads and 50% next year. Can you take us back in history? I recall that number being like 10%, 15% only a year or two ago. And then you went a little fast, was wondering if you could repeat the numbers of how many wells were sitting on each of those. I think you said 69 wells, 70 wells that had five or six wells on them. Could you go through that again?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Sure. Sure. 230 existing pads. Those are all new pads and pads that are in various stages of execution. There's 124 pads with five or fewer wells. And there's 59 pads with six to nine wells. In general, most of our pads have the capability of eventually 18 to 20 wells. So you can do the quick math there and, literally, there's thousands of that. It's page 19 in our new presentation on the website.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Those are Marcellus wells?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, those are just...", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "To get to 18 to 20?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, the existing wells are Marcellus wells.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "To get to 18 to 20?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "The future wells could literally be in any formation.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Okay.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Because again, eventually, we could be putting Utica wells in there and Upper Devonian also if we chose to, going forward. But there's literally thousands of Marcellus wells left by itself.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then going back in time.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. Going back in time, we have, of course, been experimenting with going back on existing pads for years now. And, in fact, there's an example in the presentation that has got about over two years of production history on it. And it was a pad that we went on to a five well pad and put two additional wells on it. And we were wanting to answer three questions.", "One, how much money did we actually save? Number two, did the wells interfere with the existing wells that were already there? And then number three, since we were going onto a pad that was already two years old, with the better targeting and the better completion designs, in other words, two more years of learnings, would that really help the completion? And the answer was, as presented on that slide, we saved $850,000 per well, which is huge.", "The wells did not impact the existing target. And literally, the new wells were, literally, only targeted about 20 feet or 30 feet different from the original wells. So even in the same zone, which is only about 80 feet or 90 feet thick in that area, we were only about 20 feet apart in difference and we were 700 feet between wells and we did not impact the existing wells. So that was a huge learning for us and we've repeated that several times since.", "And then the third thing is the wells, after two years of production, were 53% better producers than the original wells. So you can start to imagine, if you just go through that hundreds of times, going forward in the future, you can start seeing what sort of capital efficiencies you could bake into that, and it's pretty impressive. So we've literally got a lot of that to do.", "I think a year or so ago, we were about 10% on existing pads. This year, I think we're probably less than that, hardly any on existing pads. Another important thing that's happened this year is we have all our HBP concerns are finished. So literally, we have no more acreage at risk and so we no longer have to worry about that aspect, which allows us to, going forward, really focus our capital in the very best returns. And that's what you're going to see us doing going forward. And I think you'll see those numbers gradually increase.", "I don't think it will ever be a 100% because, clearly, we've got some really good areas like in the eastern part of Washington County in our dry acreage, where even a grass roots, brand new, four well pad there has even got better economics than going back onto an existing wet or super-rich pad. So I think it allows us, real-time, to allocate capital to the very best projects in the Marcellus. And then now, of course, we've got another world-class asset, North Louisiana, that gives us another great option.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "And then just thinking about allocated costs, pad is somewhere $1.5 million to $2 million?", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, pads can be anywhere from $1 million to $2 million. Roads can be significant to insignificant, just depending on how long they have to be. Production facilities can be several hundred thousand dollars per well on the initial install. Meter taps can be pretty expensive and then water infrastructure is super expensive.", "Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC", "(53:38).", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Jon, we have a lot of people queued up for questions. I hate to say it, but just to try to get a couple more questions out, I don't want to cut you off, but see if we can get at least \u2013 there's a bunch of people we aren't going to get to, but maybe we can get a couple more. Next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly of Seaport Global.", "Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Appreciate that, thanks. Jeff, hoping to get your thoughts pertaining to the 20% growth figure you laid out for 2018. On our model, we could get there just adding a couple rigs, and I'm curious, given the bullish macro backdrop you laid out, great liquidity, great economics at $3 gas, if you're tempted to push that growth rate maybe meaningfully higher, and wanted to gauge your willingness to outspend to get there. Thanks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, I think an important part is, we're saying we can get that kind of growth, which is great, 20% at or near cash flow with $3.25 and $60. Clearly, we have a large inventory \u2013 multi-year inventories in two really high quality areas in Pennsylvania and in North Louisiana, so it gives us a lot of optionality. To the extent prices are higher and cash flow's higher, clearly, we could ramp up and grow quicker. But our intent is to be at or near cash flow and we think 20% growth at or near cash flow, organically, is very strong.", "Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Okay. Fair enough. And then just a quick one for me, in Terryville you guys lay out the economic slide $8.7 million well cost. But sounds like you're just kind of starting to implement your own techniques there, and curious if you have a goal of where you'd get that well cost down to with John making the move down from Pittsburgh to Houston? Thanks.", "Ray N. Walker - Range Resources Corp.", "That's a great question. It's hard to peg a number yet. But we've only had \u2013 John's only had his reins six weeks, and has already had some great wins. And so I'll just characterize it as saying it's going to be significantly better. I just don't know how to peg that number yet. We just need a few more quarters under our belt to understand where we can really go with that.", "Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We're nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to Mike Scialla of Stifel for our final question.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks. Morning, guys. Just wondering on, could you talk a little bit about the potential drilling inventory in just the Upper Red within Terryville, and how the tighter landing interval may have an impact on that?", "Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, Mike, this is Alan. I think that when we went back \u2013 and let me take you back a little bit in time and talk about the acquisition and how we evaluated this thing. So as we went through, we recognized the Upper Red was really the dominant producing interval at that point in time. We recognized the changing target interval \u2013 optimizing target interval could have a material impact in terms of productivity per well. And well results and EURs could improve over what we're currently providing for you right now. So with that \u2013 and then we also think that also applies to Lower Red and the Pink intervals as well. So the same type of thing is going to happen. So with that, it's going to give us a fairly significant inventory of locations throughout Terryville, from the Upper Red down through the \u2013 or the Upper Red, the Lower Red, and then up shallower with the two Pink zones.", "So don't have a \u2013 not going to give you a specific number, but I can tell you that it's going to give us a fairly significant inventory moving forward. Going back through the whole process answering a question earlier, we think we're going to be able to grow productions down there fairly significantly, be able to drive down the gathering and processing rate as well because of the fact (57:36). And I'll be able to do it within cash flow is what our acquisition models show. And so we think it's right in line with what we currently have.", "Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Not to try and pin you down on a specific number, Alan. Just in terms of like, Netherland Sewell had some numbers out with MRD. Are those in the ballpark, or are you talking about something significantly different?", "Alan W. Farquharson - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, when we did our \u2013 to come back to our analysis \u2013 when we did our analysis, we didn't look at Netherland Sewell's analysis. We didn't look at MRD's analysis. We did our own analysis. And my answers on this thing when people have asked this, we have what we believe is our analysis going forward. There's a lot of confusion, I think, that's been out there historically between some of the different analyses that are out there. So as we continue to roll through this thing and get our arms around it, we'll provide some more clarity probably toward year-end.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.", "Jeffrey L.

It's available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.", "Before we begin, let me also point out that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. In addition, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. The supplemental tables also provide calculated natural gas differentials for the upcoming quarter and detailed hedging information for all products.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, Laith, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. The second quarter of 2017 was another quarter where Range successfully continued to execute on its long-term development plan across our deep inventory of high-quality assets. As you know, Range has built a concentrated 500,000-plus net acre position in Southwest Pennsylvania and now has a 200,000-plus net acre position in North Louisiana, both of which we believe are best-in-class assets for creating shareholder value. I want to begin by reviewing a few significant events from the quarter and then discuss that we expect to see for the remainder of 2017.", "During the quarter, we drilled on the east and west boundaries of our Southwest Marcellus position, with great success. Both of these pads, that I like to think of as bookends, were significant. And at the dry gas pad on the eastern edge is now our highest rate dry gas pad on record, and our super-rich pad on the western edge is our highest-rate condensate pad on record. If you look back at our first quarter release from April, we also highlighted a pad drilled on the north side of our Washington County acreage position. Production from that pad has been stellar and, after 100 days, has significantly outperformed our wet type curve. Ray will discuss these results in more detail in a few minutes.", "The bottom line is that these recent results highlight the quality of our Marcellus position and further confirm that we have consistent results across our Southwest Marcellus acreage. Every company says that they have core acreage. However, we encourage people to pay close attention EURs per 1,000 foot and cost per 1,000 foot when comparing quality.", "To me, it's interesting and noteworthy that Range's Marcellus discovery well was completed in 2004 and, even after more than a decade of drilling, we're still improving and setting new records in different portions of the field.", "We continue to drill longer laterals in an effort to optimize our development in Southwest Pennsylvania. Importantly, our blocked-up acreage position allows us to drill some of the longest laterals in the area. Our average lateral in Southwest Pennsylvania for the first half of 2017 was approximately 7,500 feet. We're projecting to increase that to over 9,500 feet for the second half of 2017 and should average even longer laterals as we get into 2018.", "It's worth noting that there will be an optimal lateral length when normalized EUR begins to crest and returns are maximized, but we have not found it yet. In fact, 2017 results to-date suggest that some of our longest laterals are performing extremely well on an EUR per 1,000-foot basis, which Ray will discuss in more detail.", "On the marketing side, our team has a first-mover advantage to plan and acquire a right-sized capacity with one of the lowest-cost firm transport portfolios in the Basin. Importantly, this portfolio takes our gas to good markets and we have incremental demand expected in the coming years. By year end, we should have access to additional natural gas transportation projects to take our production out of the local Appalachia markets and direct it to the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions. Rayne/Leach Xpress, Adair Southwest and Rover Phase 2 are all currently being constructed and have scheduled in-service dates before 2018. The combination of these projects and strengthening local pricing will be drivers of our expected improvement in natural gas differential for 2018.", "We've also made progress in North Louisiana, as we continue to change development activity towards a steadier cadence. Right off the bat, the team has done a tremendous job driving down the cost of drilling complete well, which has opened new economic locations. As discussed last quarter, we got off to a slow start in 2017 with our North Louisiana production. The results we've seen from the group of wells brought to sales in the first quarter were not up to par with our expectations, but we are looking forward to seeing the results in the third quarter and fourth quarters from redesigned wells in Terryville.", "We also expect to have new test results from the North Louisiana extension area, two additional horizontal wells offsetting Vernon Field to the east and west. In addition, we'll drill two vertical well science tests of the stacked pay potential of the eastern offset of the Vernon Field. Well logs indicate resources of 400 Bcf per section and stacked pays with multiple targets. These vertical wells will help us build our future development plans.", "In addition to extensive log and well test results, Range is acquiring considerable 3D seismic across some promising acreage that will help delineate and potentially expand the position. Included in the 2017 budget is approximately $16 million for 3D seismic, covering the Western portion of our position. As Range learned in the early stages of what has clearly been an extremely successful Marcellus development, which required several years, shortcutting the timeline in science in not an option. Unlocking the resource potential across 220,000 net acres of stacked pay requires a certain amount of time and well repetitions in order to establish the most predictable economic development program.", "Moving back to the corporate level. A key question for Range is how to develop our huge inventory, given the ongoing commodity price uncertainty. For 2018, we'll be responsive to prices and set our spending at or near cash flow, including any asset sales. This should lead to annual year-over-year production growth of 10% to 20% over the next couple of years, depending on commodity prices.", "Given our peer-leading well costs and EURs per 1,000 foot of lateral basis, on a relative basis, Range's growth per-dollar spent should remain amongst the best in the industry. Longer term, our sizable inventory of high-quality locations provides Range the ability to grow at a significant rate for a long time, if economically warranted. Also important, thinking long term is the benefit that Range has in having stacked horizons in both Appalachian and North Louisiana with the added optionality of drilling dry, wet or super-rich wells.", "And looking at where we'll set the growth throttle over time, we'll continually seed to balance operational efficiencies, balance sheet strength, acceleration of NAV in return of capital to shareholders. Over the long term, we expect to generate significant free cash flow for Range.", "In closing, Range's long-term planning has taken the company from its discovery of the Marcellus 13 years ago through years of significant growth while leasing and holding over a half million acres in Appalachia with stacked pay potential. And not to be overlooked is the innovative nature of our marketing and midstream arrangements that this long-term outlook has generated. This is reflected in the improvements we are seeing in year-over-year differentials and our corporate recycle ratio, both enhanced by our North Louisiana assets.", "I believe the Range has the size, the scale and the quality of inventory that is extremely difficult to match. We will continue to shape our long-term planning around both strategic assets, seeking to create long-term shareholder value.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff. Production for the second quarter came in at 1.945 Bcf equivalent per day, exceeding our guidance of 1.93 Bcf equivalent per day. Guidance for the third quarter is 1.97 Bcf equivalent per day and for the fourth quarter is expected to be 2.17 Bcf equivalent per day, resulting in annual growth of 30%. This is below our previous guidance of 33% to 35%. And there are two main drivers behind this change.", "First, as mentioned on the last earnings call, the performance of the North Louisiana wells in the first quarter was below our expectations. Using round numbers, the underperformance of these wells and the corresponding frac hits to offset production accounts for the loss of approximately $75 million a day for the year. By itself, this would explain a 5% difference in growth for 2017. Despite the early North Louisiana setback, we were still expecting to hit our full-year guidance of 33% to 35% growth, as our Marcellus wells have continued to perform well, in many cases, significantly above our average type curves.", "However, we've been hampered by delays in obtaining the necessary permits. Again, using round numbers, six pads representing 32 wells were delayed an average of 25 days per well. This represents 800 combined sales days and approximately $75 million a day of production for the year, coincidentally very similar to the underperformance from North Louisiana. So, we could have withstood some underperformance in the early North Louisiana production or we could have withstood some delays in Pennsylvania permitting, but the cumulative effect of both results in a reduction to our annual guidance. Importantly, the Pennsylvania permitting issues have been resolved and we do not expect any delays going forward and we anticipate significantly better well results in North Louisiana for the second half of the year.", "I want to emphasize that we still expect to exit the year above 2.2 Bcf equivalent per day, which is in line with our plans when we started the year. This $200 million a day ramp of new production coming online during the fourth quarter, both in North Louisiana and in Appalachia, fits well with our anticipated incremental pipeline capacity, expected improving pricing differentials and sets us up really well for 2018.", "Looking at some of the operational highlights for the quarter, let me start with Appalachia. We had two exceptional multi-well pads brought online in June. These pads happen to be on the eastern and western edges of our acreage position. These pads, in conjunction with two other pads that were announced over the last couple of quarters on the northerly and southerly portions of our development, have essentially book-ended our entire position. This highlights the high degree of confidence we have across our acreage.", "In the super-rich portion of the field on the Western edge, we recently completed a seven-well pad with an average lateral length of 10,685 feet, with the longest lateral being 14,444 feet. The wells averaged 54 stages on a per-well basis, with 2,000 to 2,500 pounds per foot of proppant placed with optimized completion designs that I'll discuss in just a few minutes.", "We're currently flowing five of the seven wells under constrained conditions, with two wells to be opened up later. The average IP per well is 29.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day, or 4,843 barrels of oil equivalent per day being 73% liquids. We've achieved and maintained rates of over 5,000 barrels a day of condensate off the pad for 24 days, setting a pad and per-well record for condensate production. During the first two weeks of production, average gas and condensate rates were more than 40% higher than the next-best offset pad.", "On the opposite side of the field, in our dry acreage, we recently brought online a four-well pad with an average lateral length of 11,100 feet. Two of the four wells have lateral lengths in excess of 15,000 feet, with up to 78 frac stages per well. All four wells are now producing, with the pad currently flowing 100 million a day. The average IP for these wells is 30 million a day per well and the 30-day average IP is 26 million a day per well. These are proven to be some of our strongest dry gas Marcellus wells ever, as we've been able to maintain 100 million a day flat for 40 days from that pad.", "Moving to the north. The super-rich pad we talked about last quarter, near the planned MarkWest Harmon Creek Plant, continues to perform well and is 65% above the type curve after approximately three months. A similar story exists in the wet area, where 23 wells have been drilled over the last nine months. These wells average 10% above the type curve after 65 days. Included in those results is a four-well pad on the southern edge of our position in the wet area that we announced a couple of quarters back that averaged 9,625-foot laterals with 46 stages and IPs at over 35 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well. Today, those four wells are forecasted to average over 4 Bcf equivalent per 1,000 foot of lateral.", "These results are exciting, not just because they're some of our best performers to-date, but also because they illustrate consistent performance enhancements. Our development plans and designs have been evolving since we discovered the Marcellus almost 13 years ago. And over the last few years, we've utilized technologies such as real-time data streaming, advanced data visualization, machine learning and predictive analysis. The performance of these new wells demonstrates early wins using this technology, identifying opportunities for improved well performance and returns through optimization of our completion designs, which involves changes like using different proppant loading for specific cases.", "Spending just a minute on the technology. Our most recent evolution of this multi-disciplined process involves developing a software platform driven by machine learning. This tool is used to address one of the most significant challenges, the non-linear, non-parametric and highly dimensional nature of predicting well performance. This platform that our team developed connects our engineering teams to a single source of data combined with interactive and predictive models. This allows them to focus their time on improving the economic outcomes of our capital program. It makes it possible to evaluate field development decisions in almost real time.", "We believe these tools and the multi-disciplined approach that we've developed represents a unique and competitive advantage for Range. While we haven't been very vocal about it, our teams have been working with machine learning and predictive analysis for years. And what's critically important is that it's truly driving improvements, as demonstrated by recent well performance. Going further, these examples clearly illustrate the quality of our low-risk long lateral inventory in Appalachia across the dry, wet and super-rich areas.", "These types of improving results, when combined with going back onto existing pads with existing gathering and compression infrastructure, generate economics that are among the best in the business. I'll repeat again, we literally have thousands of these types of opportunities. And I still don't believe we drilled out best well yet. Here we are almost 13 years after the discovery, and well performance is still getting better.", "One big driver of capital efficiency is our lateral lengths. In the first half of the year, our lateral lengths averaged 7,500 feet. But in the second half of the year, we expect length to be turned in line to exceed 9,500 feet. These longer laterals increase the cycle time slightly as we make the transition, but they really set us up well heading into 2018.", "Continuing with what was reported during our first quarter conference call, the drilling team continues to drill longer laterals this year and has drilled seven of the top ten longest laterals since inception. Of the seven laterals, four were drilled in the second quarter, averaging over 14,000 feet. Daily drilled lateral footages have increased by 57% versus the second quarter of 2016, resulting in a 23% reduction in dollar per foot drilled. This type of reduction in cost offsets some of the increases we've seen in services and supplies.", "The completions team finished the second quarter completing 20% more stages than the same time period last year, while utilizing less than three frac crews. As drilling was able to successfully drill record lateral lengths for the division, the completions team has been successful in completing these longer wells safely while continuing to test new technologies and processes.", "Shifting to North Louisiana. Our plan for the year remains consistent: focusing on Terryville while methodically testing and delineating the extension areas over time. In Terryville, we've made great strides in improving cost while driving operational efficiencies. And we're continuing to delineate the stacked pay potential of the field.", "As of the end of June, we have 23 additional wells expected to be online this year, with most of that activity in November and December. This group of wells includes 12 Upper Red, five Lower Red, and three Deep Pink wells in Terryville. The other three wells will be in the expansion areas. This is all designed to better understand the full potential of the Lower Cotton Valley. By year end, we'll also have 3D coverage across some very promising areas south of Terryville that will further assist in our delineation efforts.", "Looking ahead, we expect the Terryville wells in the second half of 2017 to perform significantly better than the wells turned to sales in the first half for a couple of good reasons. First, as mentioned on the last call, the initial batch of wells included many that had been sitting as DUCs for quite some time, over a year in many cases, and probably for good reason. We looked at these DUCs on a cost-forward basis and made the decision to go forward with the completion.", "Second, because the majority of the DUCs were in a concentrated development area, we experienced significant frac hits to offset production as we completed the wells. We discussed this on the last call. In experimenting with completion designs in order to help mitigate that interference, we made changes to fluid intensity. Essentially, we pumped the designed amount of proppant with significantly less fluid. With additional production history, it is now apparent that we under-stimulated the wells, or more simply, the wells have had lower IPs with flatter declines, indicating a less-than-optimum stimulation. On an average, we used approximately 40% less fluid per foot and the resulting production showed a similar percent decrease from what was expected.", "Going forward, we're going back to using a typical Terryville-sized completion. We have confidence in this because of the six wells we turned to sales in the second quarter, which were made up of three Upper Reds and three Lower Reds. In these six wells, we pumped larger volumes, but not as large as the original completions, as we were in the middle of analyzing the data and beginning to determine that frac volume and not proppant volume was the key. Early indications from these six wells show that the results will be better than the quarter one wells and closer to our expectations. Thus, going forward, we're headed back to larger frac volumes and better outcomes.", "Again, we believe the wells coming online in the second half of the year should meet our expectations and compete with the Marcellus. We're bringing in a frac crew later this month and the crew will run steady throughout the rest of the year. The first of these wells will likely come online in mid to late September, so we should have some very early results from the improved completion designs in our next earnings release and call. With over half the wells coming online in November and December, we expect a significant ramp in North Louisiana production in the fourth quarter, setting us up well going into 2018.", "Switching to the extension areas. The exceptional work the team has done in reducing well cost has allowed us to do more work in and around the Vernon Field, which is south of Terryville. The two expansion wells previously announced, each located in separate Terryville-sized fault blocks, again, one to the east and one to the west of the Vernon Field, continued to perform. And plans are underway to offset each well with another horizontal well. We should spud the first of those next month, expecting both wells to be online late this year.", "Additionally, we have two vertical science wells in the extension areas designed to test multiple horizons individually. This allows us to determine reservoir and rock properties unique to each layer in order to identify the best lateral targets. With over 400 Bcf per square mile and up to six target intervals, the potential is large.", "In closing, in North Louisiana, where we've improved well costs, operational efficiencies and we're gaining more understanding of a full potential of the assets. In the Marcellus, we're still continuing to improve returns through newer technologies, lower costs, longer laterals and improved well performance. We expect solid growth in the second half of this year, setting us up well for 2018.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials.", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, Ray. The big story this time last year was the dramatic production and unit cost and continued improvement in capital efficiency. These positive trends continue this year, and for the second quarter of this year are coupled with higher realized prices such that our quarterly cash flow has more than doubled from last year.", "Meanwhile, our DD&A rate and direct operating expense combined is now down to $1.04 in mcfe. GAAP net income for the second quarter was $70 million. Net income adjusted for non-cash and non-recurring items, to match analyst methodology, was $16 million. This quarter, like the first quarter of 2017, was profitable even before considering the earnings contribution from our hedge book.", "Second quarter cash flow was $194 million, a 108% increase over the second quarter of last year. Fully diluted cash flow per share for the quarter was $0.79, a 41% increase over last year's second quarter. Second quarter year-to-date cash flow totaled $452 million, a 135% increase over the same period last year. EBITDAX for the second quarter was $240 million. Year-to-date EBITDAX was $543 million. These figures are 86% and a 106% higher, respectively, than the corresponding periods from last year.", "Cash margin for the second quarter was $1.09 per Mcfe, 55% higher than the second quarter of last year, while our cash margin year-to-date is $1.28 an Mcfe, 74% higher than the first half of 2016. With two consecutive quarters of profitability and improving margins and cash flow over last year, Range is off to a great first half, with the majority of our annual production growth for the year and improved takeaway capacity still to come.", "Looking at our second quarter 2017 expenses, all items were at or below guidance except for exploration expense, which came in $1 million higher than guidance due to the timing of budgeted 2017 seismic expenditures. Expense guidance for the third quarter of 2017 may be found in the earning release.", "Committed liquidity under our bank credit facility is just under $800 million and our unhedged recycle ratio is approximately 2.5 times. With the ability to replace each unit of reserves produced with 2.5 new ones out of existing cash flow, our liquidity is more than adequate for our current and anticipated pace of operations. And as Jeff mentioned, the drilling throttle can be adjusted in response to commodity prices, available cash flow and asset sale proceeds.", "Range has continued to add hedges to its current hedge position and presently maintains price protection on over 75% of its anticipated 2017 natural gas production at a floor price of $3.23 an Mmbtu. Also approximately 65% of our 2017 oil and NGL production is hedged above current market. During the second quarter, additional 2017 and 2018 natural gas, oil and NGL hedges were added.", "Details of these hedge additions may be found in the earnings release and Range website. I would also like to draw your attention to the other Supplemental Tables posted on the website, particularly Table 9, which provides an illustration of our estimated third quarter 2017 natural gas price differential, including basis hedges. Lastly, as we're approaching the one-year mark for the Memorial transaction, investors can expect to see us file soon with the SEC the documents required to publically register the 144A Exchange Notes issued with the transaction last fall.", "In summary, with another quarter of solid profitability accomplished and the outlook for the second half of 2017 pointing toward improved margins and stronger growth, we are clearly seeing the benefits of our hard-fought effort to reduce our cost structure and improve our capital productivity flowing through our financial statements.", "Jeff, back to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Ventura. The question-and-answer session will now begin. Your first question is from Dan McSpirit of BMO Capital Markets.", "Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Good morning.", "Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Turning to the Cotton Valley. In light of recent results here, how cautious are you in changing or experimenting further with the completion technique? I'm asking in an effort here to get a better sense of the rate of change going forward and whether Range will show better results than what the prior operator delivered or even with the acquisition economics were based on. I guess put differently here, are the results expected later this year as good as it's going to get?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "That's an interesting question, Dan. I hope not. We are pretty confident, really confident, in fact, that the wells are going to be a lot better in the second half. First of all, I think I discussed this in detail on the last call, that you group the wells that are happening in Terryville into three groups. First group was wells that we really didn't have the ability to change hardly anything and then the second group were sort of in transition where we might have changed the targeting of the well or something like that. And then finally, the third group is what, of course, we're all interested in, the Range wells.", "Range picks the location, we pick the target, we pick the spacing, we pick all the parameters around the well. Those wells really started with the six wells that came online in the second quarter. And we began working on what is the most important factor in the completion design that impacts production. And we are pretty confident that we realize now that that is volume of fracture. It's different than in the lot of the shale plays. Again, remember, this is a really tight sandstone and it's a whole different frac geometry and it's a whole different world essentially.", "So what we've learned is that frac volume is important. And as we were in the middle of determining that, we made some significant steps in volume sizes through those six wells. And of course six wells is not enough to be statistically significant yet, but we did see enough of a correlation there to be really confident going forward that with our plans starting later this month that the completion designs going forward will perform a whole lot better.", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, I think another key thing to look back on the acquisition economics is prior to Range announcing the acquisition, those wells were costing 10 plus million dollars, $10 million or $11 million. When we mentioned it, on our acquisition economics were based on $8.7 million drill and complete per well. We're at $7.4 million. So when you take the $7.4 million against the type curves we have in the book that we expect that we'll get for the rest of the year, you're looking at really strong economics that compete with the Marcellus. And we have confidence that's what we're going to see for the second half of the year.", "Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Great. And as a quick follow-up to that, you talked about spending your cash flow, including proceeds from an asset sale or asset sales. What could be divested to cover the difference between cash flow and capital spending? And maybe how much is needed next year to generate, say, 20% growth at $3 NYMEX pricing?", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, when you look at we've sold, as you know, a lot of non-core assets over the years, about $4 billion worth. So we still have assets in the Mid-Continent that would be deemed non-core. One can make the case that the stuff we have in Northeast Pennsylvania, although it's high quality, is away from that core blocky stacked pay position we have in the Southwest. So there's other assets we have that we could sell. It's early to put out 2018. So we have assets we could sell to fill the gap. Clearly we've done that in the past and we'll be disciplined, but actively trying to do that.", "The other thing is, we said last October, consensus at that time was $3.25, and we said for $3.25 we could grow at 20%. So, obviously, with all else being equal, if prices are lower than at $3.25, then growth would be less than the 20%. But I don't have a specific number to give for you today, but that's currently where we are.", "Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Very good. Have a great day. Thank you.", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Ron Mills of Johnson Rice & Company.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Thanks for your answer on Dan's last question. As it relates to 2018, you talked about further differential improvement from those three pipeline systems. This year, I think you expect $0.10 to $0.15 improvement in differentials. Can we expect something similar next year? And how much, if any of that, would potentially be offset by higher transportation costs to get to those better markets?", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, I think that we're looking at significant improvements next year on the order of what you just stated. So net-net, when you look the cost to get to the markets, we're still expecting the benefit of improvements in differentials with nat gas coming in again. So the story of continued improvement differentials we see for natural gas, I think we see for NGLs as well.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Okay. And, Ray, for you. In the Marcellus or just Appalachian Basin in general, in addition to drilling longer laterals, you've talked about the use of the machine learning. What other changes has that learning resulted in, whether it's are you using non-geometric completions, are you using more proppant? Or what are some of the benefits that you're seeing from that machine learning?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, it's a good question, Ron. The ultimate benefit is well performance. And we're clearly seeing, in lot of the examples I just went through in my remarks, significant improvements above the type curves, our average type curves, that we've got published.", "So, to me, that's always the true measure is are we seeing it in well performance. And we are. It involves a lot of things from well design, from the standpoint of what target it should be in. Although the Marcellus is one compact package of shale, if you want to think about it that way, there are different layers in it. And, again, we talk about the super-rich, the wet and the dry area. But what this machine learning capability allows us to do is take this tremendous amount of data, whether it's geological, geophysical, rock properties, all of the completion histories and reservoir pressures and everything else that we see there, and look at this in multi-dimensional views. In other words, there's no bounds on the machine as to how many different things it can consider at one time.", "And so it allows us to take an approach to use all of those things you mentioned, whether it's changing the perforation design, cluster spacing, the proppant loading, the amount of fluid that we pump, exactly which target we put the lateral in. And it allows you to look at not just one well on a specific well basis, but it allows you to take your capital program and say what's the best way to get the best return in well performance out of this amount of capital in this field with these sorts of parameters.", "And so it's been a really eye-opening experience for an old frac guy like me to see this team and the technical ability that they have today to develop that. We hope to do the same thing in North Louisiana eventually, but it will take some time. Again, we've only had that property for less than a year now. And we're beginning to apply a lot of those technologies, but it's going to take a long time to build that model.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "And then just to clarify, did you say the recent six wells that you mentioned in Terryville, are those the first wells that you've done from soup to nuts in terms of Range drilling, design completion, design (38:36), bring online? And would there be any legacy Memorial wells left, or have you moved through that whole inventory?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, I think we own it from this point forward, bottom line. Those wells were pretty much Range wells. A couple of them, we may have used permits that MRD already had in hand or something like that, but I think that we would consider those our wells.", "But, again, we were in the middle of determining the results of what we saw in the first quarter, and clearly we made a mistake. We made what we thought was a good decision at the time, but looking at the results, it didn't turn out like we hoped. But going forward, we think we've cracked the code and, again, we'll start seeing those results in a couple of months from now.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Charles Robertson of Cowen.", "Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning, everybody. This is Adam Meyers stepping in for Charles Robertson. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Good morning.", "Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Just had a quick question. Obviously given some of your peers and their pending merger, was kind of interested in what your thoughts are regarding industry consolidation, really looking at how Range fits the mix there given the current low price per reserve that Range appears to be trading at?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, you're talking about the EQT Rice merger.", "Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Sure.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "If you think about it at a very high level, fewer companies I think in the Basin drilling is probably a positive thing. It's probably a more pace development, a more prudent and more rational development. So I think that's a good thing for the macro.", "In terms of Range and the price we're trading at it, I think when you look at the quality of our assets, the wells we're posting, the improvements in cash flow per share, I think we're on sale. So I would say that it's low.", "Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Okay.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Our share price is a bargain, it's clear. $0.73, our IR team was pointing that out last night. When you look at where we trade versus some of our peers and any compared quality of assets on an equivalent basis, I think for investors that believe in gas markets long term, Range is a good place to be.", "Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yeah. No, definitely makes sense. And then I guess for my follow-up, it seems like investors are gaining more traction with this idea of maybe the Cabot business model, switching to sustainable growth that returns cash to shareholders. Do you see Range moving to that business model long term? Is that something that you see on the horizon?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, I think when you look at us long term, we expect to generate significant free cash flow, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. And with long term, when you look at that, we'll look at all the different things you can do from working with the balance sheet to returning capital to shareholders. So we'll be looking at all those different options.", "Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Neal Dingmann of SunTrust.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Good morning, guys. Roger \u2013 or probably for Ray actually, my first question. Ray, you talked just two things here. You mentioned about, I think it was you, talked about the constrained conditions, how you're running a number of your wells. Will you continue to do that? And is that more just \u2013 I know I've talked to Jeff and you all about this, just the natural practice? Or is this more about you don't want to have to overbuild the infrastructure and then have the wells settle down? And certainly wells are impressive. So I'm just wondering, when you talk about this constrained condition what is driving that. And how do you see that playing out going forward?", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, that's a good question, Neal. And it's a philosophy we've had for many, many years now. Basically, when you design production facilities and things like that, you could design them to be able to produce the IP of the well unconstrained. But I think if you did that, it would be very uneconomical because you would have facilities out there that you paid for that would only be used for a month or two or maybe three at the best case.", "So what we choose to do is look at it from a project standpoint and the optimal economic approach of what is the best \u2013 when you are looking at the fact that we're going to do thousands of wells over the years and we're going to build this infrastructure system and, again, our design from the early, early on, and it took us 10 years probably get it in place, was that we would have this existing infrastructure of pads and pipelines and compression stations and water infrastructure and all of that that would allow us to optimally develop the properties going forward at the lowest cost. And I think you see that in our cost structure quarter after quarter. We're getting better, LOEs are getting better, all that.", "But what that does is you bring on some of these wells, and especially as we drill longer laterals and we're seeing the performance enhancements that we've talked about this morning, all of that means that the wells come on and they're basically choked back for months at a time before you start seeing those declines and we believe that the best economic, lowest-cost approach for developing those resources, we're going to take a very similar approach in North Louisiana, and we've talked about that, which is significantly different than what they were doing before.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "No, great. Good point. And then just moving over to slide 10 where you talk about quality of your North Louisiana acreage, you hit this a little bit earlier. Could you talk about when you look and think about the delineation, even going down as far as Jackson Parish, is most of that delineated? Or how do you anticipate your plan over the next couple, two, three quarters, will you still have to delineate down in that southern area? Or maybe just talk about the delineation plan in general, if you could. Thanks.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, the second half of the year is pretty well lined out. And like we've talked about, I think it was 23 wells that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And I think it was 12 Upper Reds and five Lower Reds and three Deep Pinks and then three more wells in the extension area.", "Most of the focus this year still remains on Terryville. And I think going into 2018, that won't change. We're still looking at delineating the edges of Terryville. In other words, taking tiers of wells south from the existing development. We see a lot of potential there. There's still potential for stacked pay and in-fill potential inside Terryville. It's going to take some time to build the reservoir models and determine that. So we'll be working on that also.", "And then, like Jeff mentioned and I talked about a little bit, the extension wells, we've had some pretty exciting early results, but pretty exciting, to the east and west of Vernon Field, so we're going to continue some work there with some additional offsets. We've got some science work going on the east side of Vernon Field to try to determine just how much potential was there and what's going to be the best way to develop that.", "One of the things we've learned in the Marcellus in the stacked pay position that we have in Southwest Pennsylvania, that it takes years and you need to be very thoughtful and strategic about how you develop and stack those laterals and what that program is going to look like. We're taking all of that learning and we're basically going to take our time and be very strategic in the same way throughout that whole 220,000-acre position. We have a big 3D that's going to be coming in later this year that is going to open up a lot more of that extension area to the south of Terryville.", "So all of that said, the primary focus is still going to be drilling development wells in and around Terryville. But we're still going to have a pretty steady program, pretty consistently, but strategically, delineating that acreage around to the south. But I think it's going to take some time to do that because we are going to be very scientific, strategic and data-based and really develop some long-term plans around that.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Great. Thanks much for the details, Ray.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.", "Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Good morning. Could you guys talk about the 25-day per well delay up in Pennsylvania and your comfort level that that won't recur?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Sure, Bob. What happened is the DEP had some issues with staffing and different things. And the permitting delays just kept getting longer and longer and longer. We have worked with the DEP. They have developed a solution worked with us very well. We have permits in the hand now for 2017. We feel very confident going forward. They have done a wonderful job in working with us to solve that issue.", "So what that caused us to do throughout the year was to substitute and move different wells around. It wasn't the same plan as we had early in the year when we developed the forecast for production growth. And so you substitute some wells, you delay some wells, you move some wells around, add a couple of wells to a pad here and there. And it just changes timing. And, again, it doesn't change the economics of the well. The capital still gets spent, the EUR doesn't change. In fact, the EURs are getting better just because we're using all the new technology.", "But what it does is when you take like the four-well pad that we did on the east side, that's 100 million a day for 40 days, that's an outstanding well. We knew it was going to be a good well, but it's a really great well. But it ended up online three months or four months later than we expected. And so when you take a big pad like that and it's delayed three months or four months, that just impacts your year's growth. And so here we're with five months left in the year, you just can't make it up.", "Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Got you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "And you think of the progress we've made, if you think back two years or three years ago, that was unheard of. And now we have that pad actually initially come in at 100 million per day from three wells.", "Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Right.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Great economics. No change to any economic parameter. No change to capital in year spent but you slide that, like Ray said, three months or four months, it makes a difference. And then you do that with the numbers Ray said, it's impactful. But we're excited we have those kind of pads. And that situation going forward looks like it's solved.", "Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "It's solved. Okay. Thanks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mike Kelly of Seaport Global.", "Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning. Jeff, you gave that 10% to 20% growth range earlier in the call. And I'm just curious on the commodity price you envision on the bottom end of that range. And I believe last quarter you laid out in a $60 oil, $3 gas world, you could be 20% plus. What's the bottom end envisioned? Thanks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, you look at strip pricing for next year, and I'm probably a week out, is it $2.90 or something like that, $2.80 something. First quarter is good. We have good hedges in there. And we think when you look at the pricing for oil and for gas and you look at the rig counts and where they are, I think Appalachian rig count right now is around 60 actually combined Marcellus, Utica, haven't been spiking up, and you look at the cash flow that's available for Permian players at, call it, $49 a barrel oil or $45 to $50 or something like that, cash flow will be down. So we think that strip historically is wrong. It probably will come up a little bit.", "And interestingly, if you look in the back of our book on slide 66, it has total macro Lower 48 oil production streaming up, like everybody sees it. But when you look at the total gas position in U.S.-ex to Northeast, it's pretty flat. So you look at the Northeast, its constrained, far Northeastern Pennsylvania until Atlantic Sunrise comes on. That's basically you're looking at probably middle of 2018 or before.", "So we think that the macro setting up, strip pricing may be a little better. We said that $3.25 gas last October about where consensus was that we'd grow at 20%. Consensus today, I think it is $3.12 or $3.14 something like that, so growth may be a little lower. And not going to throw a specific number out, but we'll be in good shape I think. With where gas is next year, most likely expectation is that 10% to 20% range.", "Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Okay. That lower end of 10%, is that something that you could achieve at a $2.50 gas price? How should we think about that lower end?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, $2.50, I think the whole industry slows down dramatically at $2.50. You saw what the rig count did early part of 2016 as the gas went to $2.50 and ultimately broke $2 for a little bit. And the only good part, I think the industry is pretty sensitive, the message anymore is most of the operators are going to be living at or near cash flow. So I don't think you're going to see the big out-spends.", "If prices dip down, we'll be sensitive to cash flow. I'm sure you have a model of Range and you can model what that cash flow is. But we're going to be sensitive and set the throttle somewhere in that position. I think if gas goes to $2.50, you'll see the industry slow down dramatically. I don't think it'll stay there that long.", "Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Got it. Appreciate it. And just a quick one for Ray. In the second half of this year, if these 22 wells in the Terryville don't really pan out and you don't see the results that you're looking to see, I'm just curious how you could think about or how quickly you could pull capital away potentially from the Terryville in 2018, maybe slow down there and shift that back toward Appalachia. Thanks.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, it's a good point, Mike. Of course, if we don't see the results, then, yeah, we're going to slow down and look at this a lot harder. We have a lot of confidence in what we're doing going forward. And we've seen the data. We've looked at it seems like 1,000 different ways with 1,000 different experts. And so I feel very confident that the team has their arms around it and that we're really confident going forward. But, again, we're going to learn a lot in the third and fourth quarter. We should see some really improving results in North Louisiana, but we're also moving the needle forward in Marcellus. We continue to make better wells there. So I think we'll look at all of that as we approach the budgeting time. And the board approves the budget in December and I think that's when we'll know what the plans are for next year.", "Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Appreciate it, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey. Good morning. Range is often lumped into the higher-levered balance sheet camp. And there's always been the case that I think you've made, that EBITDA growth will help to de-lever. You highlighted in one of your slides that you have been active in asset sales in the past. How close are you to considering more meaningful asset sales, equity issuance or other ways to bring that leverage down further, particularly if the $3.25 doesn't materialize?", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, Brian. This is Roger. I'll comment on the leverage. And you're exactly right. With our windshield ratio, the recycle ratio at 2.5%, even with a pretty dismal backward-dated strip, we're able to grow within cash flow at a respectable rate. So that gives us a lot of comfort. The rear-view mirror ratio at 3 times debt to EBITDAX, at this point in the cycle we're comfortable with it, but long term, we're not. We want to get that back down to historical levels. And as you know, the first lever we pull when we want to do that is the asset sale lever. And as Jeff said, $4 billion is what we've sold in the past.", "We've still got some attractive assets to sell. And it would be imprudent for me to comment on the likelihood or expectations of that effort. But that's clearly the next stop on the waterfall for those proceeds.", "When you look at our debt structure, it's a very stable balance sheet. Our bondholders are obviously pleased with the paper. The spreads remain tight to our index. We trade tighter than a lot of our even higher-rated peers. S&P has us at BB+, both agencies at stable outlook, which is all appropriate given our low cost structure, our asset quality, the deep inventory we've got, the track record.", "So as I said, we're comfortable at this point in the cycle. But we're going to work hard to get that leverage down. I think when you look at the composition of the liability structure, one thing you'll notice and investors will notice is we're carrying over $900 million in floating rate bank debt right now, which we're real comfortable with, because we've got a rock-solid borrowing base, no pun intended, and ample liquidity for whatever we have planned. But we really like having pre-payable debt that we can pay down literally at a moment's notice with some asset sale proceeds or if we're blessed with a normal winter. So that's going to be the first place we go is to reduce that debt. And we're positioned to be able to do that with that revolver balance.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is with regards to guidance for next year. You talked about the risks from a gas price perspective. What do you have baked in in terms of Louisiana well performance, Marcellus well performance and pipeline takeaway and timing out of Appalachia, what are the risks around the volume guidance one way or the other for reasons other than gas price?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, I think when you look at, again, we'll have a lot of flexibility on where we allocate capital. As Ray said, the good part is you look at the big fourth quarter ramp, 200 million per day, it's timely when you look at the pipes that are coming on that I mentioned in my notes. It's also timely that differentials tend to be \u2013 improve up in Appalachia in the fourth and first quarter.", "So we'll have a nice ramp going into there. We have flexibility. By the time we get to the end of the year, we'll know lot more about the Terryville wells. Like Ray said, we have confidence in those wells in the second half. And with the expectations that we have, those economics will compete with the Marcellus.", "However you look at the Marcellus, we're drilling longer laterals and we're getting some spectacular wells. And we do think basis will improve up there for 2018 given the new pipes that are coming on and the fact that we think overall that those pipes won't fill the rig count, like I said, up there currently around 60. We had commented in the past, to fill those pipes, the industry would have to be we think somewhere around 120 to 130 rigs. And that would have been a few months ago. And I've heard other people say the rig count needs to be at least 90 to fill them by 2019. So I think Range is in good shape. And we have adequate flexibility.", "We've talked all along, one of the advantages of the acquisitions was to be able to toggle capital either way. And I can sit here and build a case where, with success in Terryville and success in the extension areas, you'd toggle more capital that way, or with basis coming in the Marcellus and longer laterals, we'd toggle more capital in Appalachia. So we'll look at that very hard as we go into next year.", "But with the pipes we have, I think our team's done a good job of thinking through the flexibility. And couple of those pipes that I mentioned, for us, we're expecting should be on in the fourth quarter, that's Rayne/Leach, Adair Southwest, Rover is scheduled to be on. But even if there's slight delays, I think our team does a good job of thinking through the various outcomes and planning for contingencies.", "Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for his concluding remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thanks to everybody for participating on the call.

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President of Investor Relations at Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's third quarter earnings call. The speakers on today's call are, Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Chief Financial Officer.", "Hopefully you've had a chance to review the press release and updated investor presentation that we've posted on our website. We'll be referencing some of those slides this morning. We also filed our 10-Q with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.", "Before we begin, let me also point out that we'll be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. In addition, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. The supplemental tables also provide calculated natural gas differentials for the upcoming quarter and detailed hedging information on all products.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, Laith, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. As we approach the close of 2017, Range is nearing a very important and exciting point in the company's Marcellus development. We are clearly at an inflection point in what has, in essence, been a decade-long commissioning of the largest gas field in the country.", "Range has been a leader in finding and developing the Marcellus play and now is in a position to capture additional value. Major projects, such as LNG facilities, power plants and the like, have long construction periods of capital-intensive work. For Range, this commissioning phase is nearing an end, with the last of our three natural gas infrastructure commitments slated to come online by early 2018.", "The culmination of this build-out provides Range substantial deliverability of gas, NGLs and condensate to markets across the U.S. and internationally. This infrastructure will enable us to continue developing our Marcellus inventory in an increasingly capital-efficient manner.", "The portfolio of takeaway projects that Range has secured over the last decade enables us to move natural gas production of almost 2 Bcf per day to meet our customers' growing demand, both outside and within the Appalachian Basin. The completion of this infrastructure foundation in concert with a high-quality inventory we believe will deliver strong returns on capital for many, many years.", "For Range specifically, as a result of this infrastructure, we expect continued improvement in our realized natural gas prices as a result of gas transported into higher-priced markets and improved local pricing. Based on strip pricing, we expect that improvement could result in a corporate natural gas differential to Henry Hub of only about minus $0.15, or better, for 2018, offsetting increased transport costs in 2018.", "We also see positive market conditions on the NGL side as well, with fundamentals coming back into balance due to increased domestic use and significant exports. Range has participated in the market improvements, as evidenced by our higher reported NGL price realizations and guidance.", "Looking at ethane first. Range's ethane portfolio continues to accomplish two important goals for us. One, we're increasing cash flow versus leaving ethane in our gas stream. And, two, we can meet natural gas pipeline specs even with substantial growth. In fact, we're extracting and selling such a significant percentage of our ethane that Range could theoretically double its wet gas production from current levels, leave all the additional ethane in the gas stream and still have no problems meeting pipeline spec. That's an enviable position to be in as one of the largest NGL producers in the country and it provides us of the flexibility of finding additional ethane agreements in years to come that are cash flow accretive.", "On the propane side, as the only producer with capacity on Mariner East 1, we continue to sell almost all of our propane production into international markets. So far this year, the Range team has been able to realize Mont Belvieu-plus pricing. Again, an enviable position among NGL producers as we have the ability to see how the Appalachian NGL market continues to develop with projects like Mariner East 2, in-basin steam crackers and other projects and make decisions about the additional transactions based on the economic benefits to Range from those transactions rather than operational constraints.", "As a result of the projects Range has in place and the improving fundamentals in the NGL market, we're projecting that Range's NGL realizations as a percent of WTI will reach the highest levels that we've seen in several years for the fourth quarter of 2017. Based on strip pricing, we expect our 2018 realizations to be in the 30% to 32% of WTI range, despite a very backwardated 2018 strip that we believe have the potential to improve.", "Operationally, I'm pleased that the Range-designed and drilled wells in North Louisiana are performing well, and we expect to get similar strong results from the wells we're bringing on line in the fourth quarter and going forward. In Pennsylvania, the long laterals we're drilling are also performing well, and we continue to drill some of the best wells in the company's history, which Ray will cover here in a minute.", "Regarding capital allocation, our expectation is that we'll allocate additional capital to the Marcellus to utilize the additional firm takeaway capacity coming online. Both areas of operations have seen recent drilling success, but using North Louisiana cash flow to fund additional Marcellus drilling will drive better overall corporate returns next year as we optimize capacity, and it demonstrates one of the benefits of having two high-quality resource plays.", "For 2018, we have not yet finalized our budget and, as a result, we will not give formal guidance at this time. What I can say is that, at strip pricing, we would expect to spend at or slightly below our projected cash flow. This will result in volumes sufficient to satisfy our transportation commitments on the pipelines coming into service during 2018.", "Beyond 2018, when our transportation commitments are satisfied, we will have more flexibility to achieve moderate growth in production while spending less than cash flow and de-levering our balance sheet in the current commodity price environment. To the extent that commodity prices improve from current levels, it's our current intention to use the excess cash flow to reduce leverage rather than accelerate growth.", "Looking at the balance sheet, we're committed to reducing our debt to EBITDAX to less than 3 times as swiftly as we can and, in the longer term, we will strive towards an investment-grade profile. In order to reduce leverage, we're pursuing various asset sales, which includes our remaining Mid-Continent properties in our Northeast Pennsylvania assets. In addition, we will look at ways to pull forward value on some of our acreage that we would not otherwise develop in a timeframe that drives our valuation.", "By efficiently allocating capital to our best projects and spending below cash flow, Range can de-lever over time, given the quality of our inventory. The magnitude and timing of this method to reduce debt is clearly very sensitive to commodity prices. However, given our peer-leading recycle ratio, Range's capital efficiency, our growth per dollar spent should remain among the best in the industry. While we're proud of that metric, we're equally focused on improving our leverage metrics.", "Many of our stockholders have been loud and clear that they expect the industry to rapidly focus on the next stage of the shale play development, which is focusing less on growth metrics, and instead focusing on return on capital, cash flow and returning cash to shareholders when it makes sense.", "We agree. We think it's right for Range and our investors as well, and this fits well with our current stage of development in the Marcellus. I think it's also worth pointing out, for the last decade, Range has been one of the very few E&P companies with its executive compensation tied to debt-adjusted per-share metrics and not absolute growth targets. In addition, this year Range added a drilling rate of return metric to our compensation. We think this clearly evidences our board's and management's commitment to return-based metrics.", "We have deployed or redeployed billions of dollars of your capital and, in doing so, we achieved a strong position in one of the best shale basins in the world. Going forward, we expect Range's combination of assets and infrastructure will permit the flexibility to continually optimize returns from drilling capital, balance sheet improvement and returns to shareholders.", "What distinguishes Range is both a very high quality and a very large inventory. We have core locations that will last for many years beyond that of most other companies. As gas demand continues to grow with time and if gas trades more like an international commodity, Range will have plenty of high-quality inventory, which we believe will create significant free cash flow and shareholder value over the long term.", "I will now turn the call over to Ray to discuss our operations.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff. Production for the third quarter came in at 1.99 Bcf equivalent per day, which is a little over our guidance of 1.97 Bcf equivalent per day. And guidance for the fourth quarter remains at 2.17 Bcf equivalent per day, resulting in annual growth of 30%. Organically, this represents about 10% year-over-year growth.", "This expected $200 million a day ramp of new production coming online during the fourth quarter fits well with our anticipated incremental pipeline capacity, expected improving pricing differentials and sets us up well for 2018, consistent with Jeff's description of next year and beyond.", "Looking at some of the operational highlights for the quarter. We'll start with Appalachia and bring you up to speed on some exceptional well performance from seven different Marcellus pads spread across our acreage position in southwest Pennsylvania.", "Starting in the super-rich area, we reported a seven-well pad last quarter with an average lateral length of 10,685 feet completed with an average of 54 stages per well. At the time, we reported five of the seven wells were flowing to sales with strong results.", "The remaining wells were brought to sales in the third quarter, generating an average IP per well for the seven wells of over 30 million cubic feet equivalent per day, or 5,000 BOE per day per well being greater than 70% liquids.", "These wells continue to be high condensate producers, with the pad producing over 5,000 barrels per day of condensate for over 30 days, which was a main driver behind our 21% quarter-over-quarter increase in condensate production for the company.", "The wells have been transitioned to permanent production equipment, which by design constrains the wells and, after 90 days of production to sales under these constrained conditions, are performing well above the type curve on a normalized basis.", "Also in the super-rich portion of our acreage, we completed two four-well pads turned to sales in the third quarter. The average lateral length for the eight wells is 9,652 feet completed with an average of 49 stages per well.", "The average IP from the two pads were both greater than 40 million cubic feet equivalent per day per well and more than 60% liquids. One of the pads came online early in the quarter. And after 90 days to sales, again under constrained conditions, continues to perform significantly above the normalized type curve.", "Moving to the east in our wet gas area, I want to update you on a three-well pad turned to sales last quarter near the Houston plant. Having been online for about 180 days and under constrained conditions, the wells are performing 77% above the wet area type curve on a normalized basis. These are clearly outstanding wells and highlight improved well productivity from an area that we began drilling over a decade ago.", "Also in the wet gas area, we recently completed a five-well pad and a six-well pad with average lateral lengths of 11,416 feet averaging 58 stages per well. We're currently flowing the wells under constrained conditions through our permanent production equipment, with two wells still cleaning up on flowback. And the average IP per well on each pad was over 30 million cubic feet equivalent per day with over 50% liquids.", "Moving further to the east, to the dry gas area. On the last call, we discussed a four-well pad in our dry gas acreage with average laterals greater than 11,000 feet. At the time of the last call, this pad had maintained a flow rate of 100 million a day for 40 days. Updated numbers show this pad maintained 96 million a day for 99 days, with production at the end of the third quarter still well over 80 million a day for the pad. These are incredible results. And we're presently offsetting this pad and expect to bring the new wells online by the end of this year.", "All of the pads I just discussed are pointed out on a new slide on page 9 in our updated presentation on the website. These highlighted pads are a reflection of the quality and repeatability of our asset, our large de-risked inventory and our exceptional team in Appalachia. I believe they also reflect our technical team's ability to significantly improve well results by incorporating Big Data analytics and, therefore, applying the appropriate completion strategies and technologies.", "Range currently holds four of the top-six highest reported rates to sales in the entire Marcellus play. We literally have thousands of these types of opportunities left to drill across our acreage position, representing many years of value-creating development.", "We continue to make improvements in operational efficiencies across the board in Appalachia. Let me go through some quick examples comparing the third quarter of this year to the third quarter of last year.", "On the drilling side, we drilled one well in the third quarter of 2016 that was greater than 10,000 feet of lateral length. We drilled 19 wells greater than 10,000 feet in the third quarter of this year. The average drilled lateral length in the third quarter of 2016 was 6,171 feet. The average in the third quarter of 2017 was over 11,700 feet, representing a 90% increase.", "Importantly, drilling costs per lateral foot in the third quarter of 2016 was $302 and in 2017 is $202 per foot, which is a 33% decrease. This means we drilled 90% longer laterals at 33% less cost per foot than a year ago. And five of the company's top-10 longest laterals were drilled in the third quarter of this year.", "The completions team successfully completed 1,730 fracs stages in the third quarter, which is a record amount of stages representing 31% more stages than the previous record while only utilizing three frac crews.", "Year-to-date, lease operating expenses in Appalachia are 15% lower on a unit basis as compared to the same time period last year. Water sharing agreements with outside operators and the redeployment of production facilities have been large contributors to saving millions of dollars by reducing our capital cost and operating expenses and are a key part of our strategy to compete in what is currently a difficult commodity business.", "While it's early and we're still working on the plans for 2018 budget, in Appalachia we believe the average lateral length of wells put to sales next year will be over 10,000 feet versus an average of greater than 9,500 feet for the second half of this year. The mix of dry wells versus wet wells is expected to be slightly higher in 2018, and we should be approaching around 50% of our wells on existing pads versus around 30% this year.", "Again, it's early, and this can change throughout the year as the team optimizes our plan, as they always do, striving for the best economics and more capital-efficient operations. I'm pleased to report that the permitting process has run very efficiently these past few months and we don't foresee any issues with permits going forward. Our team, along with the Pennsylvania DEP, has done a tremendous job getting us back on track.", "Shifting now to North Louisiana. Our plan for the remainder of the year remains consistent, focusing on Terryville while strategically testing and delineating the extension areas. In Terryville, we've made great strides in improving cost while driving operational efficiencies and we're continuing to delineate the stacked pay potential of the field. In Terryville, we announced the first three wells located, designed and executed totally by the Range team in early September.", "The two Upper Red wells have averaged 30-day rates to sales of $25.8 million and $20.7 million public feet equivalent per day, respectively, with lateral lengths of 7,427 feet and 6,827 feet. Both were completed with typical fluid intensity and both wells are in line with the type curve, as expected. A good example of the stack pay potential at Terryville is the Lower Deep Pink well on that same pad, which is a 7,400-foot lateral completed with 25 stages. The well averaged 20.2 million cubic feet equivalent per day for 30 days for sales and is the best Pink interval well drilled in the field to-date. We have more wells planed in this area for 2018 and beyond.", "We did not bring any new wells online during the quarter after these three. On the last call, we were hopeful that we would have had a couple of more Terryville wells to discuss on this call, but the frac crew showed up a few weeks later than we had predicted. We just started the flowbacks on two Upper Red wells and are in the very early stages of cleaning these wells up. Currently, we have three frac crews working and this activity will, of course, drive the big ramp in production during the fourth quarter as the remaining 2017 wells will be coming online in November and December.", "In the extension area, we currently have work going on a three new fault blocks that look promising. We recently finished completing a well in a new fault block to the north of Driscoll Field, which is south of Terryville. The lateral was completed in three phases to study different completion designs and to get detailed information in order to model the reservoir. The early production data is very promising, with peak 24-hour production rates on a normalized basis being over 3.5 million per day per thousand-foot of lateral.", "Also the horizontal wells offsetting our early extension area horizontal test in separate salt (20:50) blocks to the east and west of Vernon Field are underway, with one rig drilling and the other rig moving in next week. We expect to see production from these two wells late this year or early next year.", "Switching to marketing. By the end of the first quarter of 2018, Range will have incremental gross transportation capacity of 900 million a day out of southwest Pennsylvania, with over 70% reaching the Gulf Coast, which currently receives near NYMEX-based pricing.", "These projects include TransCanada's Leach and Rain (21:29) Xpress Projects and Enbridge's Tetco Adair Southwest Project, which are both projected to be in service prior to year-end, and then Energy Transfer's Rover Project, which should reach full completion by the end of the first quarter of 2018. When all of these are online, Range will have the ability to transport greater than 90% of its production out of southwest Pennsylvania to markets which we believe will continue to provide better pricing.", "Of the additional capacity, Range plans to immediately fill more than half by, first, rerouting our existing local production and then, second, we'll be sending volumes from the fourth quarter production growth to these projects. By the end of 2018, we should essentially reach full utilization of our transportation.", "Importantly, these additions to Range's portfolio reduce basis volatility, especially during seasonally weak months and should increase the predictability of Range's corporate natural gas differential going forward.", "As it relates to the near-term macro for natural gas, the in-service of these Appalachian projects does not always mean that production will immediately increase to fill the new capacity. I understand that this has been the case in the past, when capacity additions were anywhere from two-tenths of a B per day all the way up to a close to a B per day, and the industry seemed to immediately fill those new pipes.", "However, with between 13 Bcfs per day and 14 Bcfs per day of new capacity additions happening between now and the end of 2018, we believe industry cannot support the production increases equivalent to the capacity added from these projects in southwest Pennsylvania, especially given where the strip is today combined with sweet spot exhaustion. Unless we see a significant uptick in rig additions, we think the Basin will see significant displacement of gas from local markets over the next few quarters as production has simply moved to better markets rather than an instant wave of new production.", "Moving to liquids. Range reported NGL pricing of 35% of WTI during the third quarter, which, for Range, is the highest realization as a percent of WTI in several years, primarily led by the increases we've seen in propane prices both domestically and internationally.", "Propane prices slowly increased throughout this past summer and achieved multi-year highs in September as inventories versus the five-year average remained below normal, especially when adjusting for current demand and export levels based on days of storage. Slower than expected domestic propane supply growth and strong export demand have continued to pull storage down. That, coupled with low stocks in Asia ahead of winter and the start-up of additional PDH plants in the last part of 2017 and into 2018, should keep U.S. and global propane prices elevated into next year.", "As the only producer with propane capacity on Mariner East 1, Range has been exporting the majority of its propane out of market since early 2016. By doing so, we've been able to capture above-Mont Belvieu prices in Europe and Asia and expect to see opportunities to replicate this success in the future.", "Looking into 2018 and 2019. As additional NGL projects start up in Appalachia over the coming quarters, Range is well-positioned to benefit financially, as local NGL supply is sent out of Basin, improving local liquids pricing. Range will have the optionality of selling both internationally and taking advantage of improving local markets.", "As a result of these anticipated improvements to NGL pricing, we expect to see a percent of WTI differential for Range's fourth quarter NGL price of around 35%. And though still early, 2018 appears to be at a much better starting point than how 2017 began. Again, we believe this will be a unique advantage for Range as one of the largest NGL producers in the U.S.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials.", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, Ray. In the third quarter, revenues and cash flow were higher than the prior quarter and significantly higher than the third quarter of last year. We hit our marks on production and total costs were in-line with guidance.", "Natural gas, NGL and oil revenues, including cash-settled derivatives, were $524 million or 47% higher than the third quarter of 2016. Third quarter cash flow was $204 million, 66% higher than last year. Year-to-date cash flow totaled $656 million, a 108% increase from year-to-date 2016. Third quarter EBITDAX was $251 million and year-to-date EBITDAX totaled $794 million.", "Fully diluted cash flow per share for the third quarter was $0.83, 22% higher than the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date cash flow per fully diluted share was $2.68, 46% higher than year-to-date last year.", "As cash revenue is growing faster than cash costs, our MCFE cash margin for the third quarter was $1.09, which is in-line with the second quarter and a 33% improvement over the third quarter of last year. With strengthening NGL prices and new pipeline capacity coming on later in the fourth quarter and early next year, we anticipate noteworthy improvement in our cash margins going forward.", "Net income adjusted for non-cash and non-recurring items, using common analyst methodology, was $12 million, while GAAP net income was a loss of $128 million due to several extraordinary expense items. On the recurring item expense side, direct operating unit cost expense came in $0.02 above guidance due to higher work-over costs, while production taxes came in $0.01 over guidance due to higher-than-anticipated ad valorem and severance taxes, including the Pennsylvania Impact Fee. Other unit costs were below or in-line with guidance.", "On the non-recurring expense side, we had a bit of noise in the quarter. First, we took $73 million in proved property impairments to the Mid-Continent cost center as we prepared our remaining Mid-Continent properties for an active sales process. $9 million of this total represents an exploratory dry hole expense also booked to the Mid-Continent cost center.", "Second, under successful efforts accounting, leases that we did not anticipate renewing upon expiration in future periods must be impaired in the current quarter. As a result, we impaired a total of $43 million of unproved properties in the third quarter as we have begun to rightsize and further high-grade our anticipated 2018 leasing activity.", "Turning to the balance sheet. As Jeff stated, we are intently focused on bringing down our leverage below 3 times over the near term, with additional reductions to follow. We have active asset sales process underway. But as usual, timing of these sales is difficult to predict. Until sales are consummated, our liquidity remains ample, with over $600 million in committed availability and no long-term debt maturities until 2021.", "The third quarter was an active quarter for our hedging program, with additional 2017, 2018 and 2019 volumes hedged across most all of our products. In particular, we added significant hedge positions to our projected 2018 natural gas production. The specifics of these new hedges are too numerous to mention, but are detailed in the earnings release, 10-Q and supplemental tables found on the Range website.", "In summary, third quarter was solid and steady. We hit our marks and look forward to the fourth quarter, which should bring higher production, improving margins and an excellent base to build from in 2018.", "Jeff, back to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Ventura. And your first question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Morning, guys. Hey, Jeff. Just as you talked about the generalities of 2018, I know you can't talk specifics, but curious if you could just provide a little bit more description by how you may think about capital allocation between the Marcellus and Louisiana and maybe anything that may cause you to change that allocation thought process?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Okay. Great question, Ron. We haven't finalized our 2018 plans yet, but let me try and come at it from a little different angle to see if I can help frame it a little bit.", "As you know, we have additional firm transportation coming on in Appalachia into 2018. And it makes strong economic sense to utilize as much of that capacity as we can as quickly as possible.", "A good portion of that capacity, more than half, will be immediately used by simply redirecting volumes out of the current local sales to better markets. Also, we have flexibility in how we can allocate capital. And by allocating additional capital to the Marcellus, we expect to fully utilize the new capacity by the end of next year.", "To do so will only require corporate growth of approximately 10%. At current strip prices, we believe we can achieve that 10% year-over-year growth while spending less than cash flow. That's a great starting point for 2018 because, theoretically, any increases in commodity prices or proceeds from asset sales could go straight to paying down debt, and we would still fill our new firm capacity. And I'll reiterate that at current strip pricing, spending within cash flow is embedded in our plans going forward.", "The important thing to note is that we're in a very good position coming into 2018. We feel we're on track in north Louisiana, as you've seen with our recent wells, and we continue to drill phenomenal wells in Pennsylvania with longer laterals.", "Hopefully, that provides a little context. And we're looking forward to providing a full update later this year or early next year.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "And then I just want to follow-up, just as it relates to Louisiana. As your Upper Reds are now tracking your curve, can you provide a little bit more details maybe, Ray, on the Deep Pink and your early thoughts from that well? And how development of that zone could fit into the Upper Red?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, sure, Ron. Clearly, that Pink well is the best well in the field to-date from that interval, and we're going to continue to study that. We're definitely making plans to offset it, of course. And I think we'll do some wells in 2018 and 2019 and beyond in that area again.", "We think there's several cases throughout the field where there's some stacked pay potential like that. It's hard to talk about until we've tested them and fracked them and completed them and so forth, but we're very encouraged with that.", "We're also very encouraged that the Upper Red wells are right on track. We've got I think 16 more to put online in the fourth quarter that we have really good expectations for. And we look forward to reporting on all of that as we get some of that production history probably at the next call in February.", "Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein.", "Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "A quick follow-up on the 2018 capital allocation. You mentioned in some of your prepared comments a focus on dry gas. Is the idea there that gives you the biggest volume to fill that new takeaway capacity?", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, I think that what I said was I think right now the plans are really early, so this is not formal guidance by any means. But in the current plans that we're putting together, it looks like our mix of dry gas versus liquids and super-rich gas will be slightly higher. But I think that's more of a timing at looking at what's available as far as existing pads to drill on and capacity in the gathering systems at the compressor stations and so forth and so on rather than just trying to optimize.", "Now, given that everything else is equal, clearly, we would drill the dry gas well to create more volume faster and the economics are still a little bit better there also. So, it's sort of all of that worked in together. But right now, it does look like it will be slightly more dry than next year, but, again, that probably will change. It always does.", "Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Gotcha. And then a quick follow-up on north Louisiana. As you move south to Driscoll Field, it looks like that Cotton Valley interval gets awfully thick. Do you think that, number one, are there multiple zones in, say, the Red there? And, two, will the cost of those wells rise? Is it more over-pressured? Any thoughts?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, it's a great question, Bob. And, yes, you're exactly right. As you go deeper into the Basin or south of Terryville, we do see a good thickening reservoir. And, in fact, on slide 11 in our presentation is a cross section that illustrates that very fact.", "You go from a focus on Upper Red in Terryville around 100 Bs per square mile to some of the areas down in Driscoll and around Vernon are close to 400 Bs per square mile. You go from one pretty much identified target in the Upper Red to where the Upper Red down in the southern part of the Basin there might have three targets in it. The Lower Red, Vernon Field is primarily a Lower Red development, so that has about three targets in it.", "And so, like we talked about on the last call, we've got a couple of vertical tests going and we're going to go slow and be very strategic and thoughtful about what's the best way to approach these fault blocks, but, again, we're very encouraged. We've announced another encouraging result in this new fault block to the north of Driscoll Field, so we've got three fault blocks now that look very encouraging and we're going to look forward about talking about the results of some more tests in those wells as we get into next year.", "Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from SunTrust.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Good morning, guys. And just looking, Jeff, at that slide on page nine, obviously, some fantastic results, particularly on those two in the four-well pad, over 41 a day, and then that four-well pad over 40 a day. I see the lateral lengths there.", "Can you talk about, is there anything else special on those wells that, as far as the surfactant, or just the fluid that you did on those, those obviously, stuck out a little bit. I didn't know if you had any more color around those.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. Neal, this is Ray. And I'll fill in that one and Jeff can add some color, too, or Alan. But, clearly, I think the biggest change is that we've continue to optimize our reservoir models and we continue to look at things like targeting, cluster, perforation cluster placement, the amount of proppant that we're putting in there, fluid, injection rates.", "Again, we present to the public three type curves: super-rich, wet and dry. But the reservoir team up there and the completions team has about 30 different models that they're working on at any one given time. So I think it's just a refinement of that.", "I think another big influence, really, really big influence, over the last three, four years, has been basically, as we've incorporated the Big Data analytics and starting to look at a whole slew of different variables and using machine learning. And what's important is, taking that machine learning and then doing predictive analysis with it and doing some things that weren't necessarily apparent to an old frac engineer like me, for instance, things that were totally different. And clearly, it's paying off.", "If you go back and look at my remarks in the last conference call where I talked about we had some areas that were over 4 Bs per 1,000-foot, clearly all these wells we just talked about. And the slides that illustrate the fact that it's across the whole position; it's not just any one particular area. And we literally do have thousands more of these to do and the lateral lengths are getting longer and the teams are getting better and we're using more predictive analysis in analytics and so forth.", "And so, I think this is a trend you're going to continue to see and we look forward to updating all these economics and curves and costs and everything, like we always do about first of the year, so I think we'll come out with that probably in February. And we're pretty excited about what we see going forward. The economics are looking really, really good.", "And I think it's a great timing, like Jeff talked about in his remarks, that we're at that point where all of these big projects are reaching commissioning. We said we don't have any more big projects coming online. We believe there's going to be a very viable market there locally and we're going to be able to take advantage of that. And I think is a strategy that we've been 10 years putting together and it's coming to fruition. And I'm, for one, really glad to see it.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "And just add a little bit. I think Ray and Dennis and really the entire team that we have working on that technically are just doing a great job of continuing to drive performance up.", "But the other thing at a higher level, and just \u2013 and Ray said it, but it's an important point when you look at that slide on page nine, we have a big blocky position in the core part of the play. And there's a lot of advantages to that, and particularly now that we have all that infrastructure in place. It just demonstrates, that slide, coupled with where we've been trending over time that that position is high-quality across northeast, southwest and the center part of it. We have a big blocky position that enables us to continue to drill longer laterals, continue to drive efficiencies and experiment.", "And, again, Ray said it earlier, we think the cores of these plays are defined. And the key is what company has core, and you're going to start at some point to see that sweet spot exhaustion. Range will have plenty of inventory to drive well beyond that and to continue to drive efficiencies.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "One more point I wanted to just emphasize again is the pad number five on that map is a pad right by the Houston plant. For those of you that have followed us for a long time, the Discovery Marcellus well was basically right by the Houston plant there. And, of course, we built some of those early systems there. And those wells have been really good from decades \u2013 from a decade ago, and that system has been packed for years without the ability to add anything to it.", "That pad has been online for 180 days and it's almost 80% above the type curve on a normalized basis. And if you look at the IPs, it stacks up well and it's a 30% shorter lateral on average than most of the other ones in there. So we're really, really excited about the potential locations that we see going forward. And I think that's a great example that we don't want to over gloss it.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Great details, guys. And then just one follow-up if I could. Ray, you and Roger mentioned about, obviously, the focus on getting that debt down to about 3 times and getting it to investment-grade. Being cognizant of not having that 2018 plan out there, would that entail trying to get to that \u2013 I'm just trying to look at the general overall activity with given prices today, given your hedges and given the plant capacity coming on. Would that mean would you potentially accelerate or think about going the other way as far as trying to bring that leverage in line?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Let me start. But when would you look at leverage, and, in fact, that might have been noticed that I gave originally and then the answer to Ron's question initially, the important part is we think to fill pipes requires approximately 10% growth, which we think we can do at current strip price. And we can do that, get 10% year-over-year growth, spending less than cash flow.", "In addition to that, we have active asset sale underway. So it's really a combination of those two things, of that asset sales coupled with the ability to fill pipes and get growth below cash flow that would drive delevering.", "The pace of that then depends on where oil and gas prices and liquids prices end up coupled with the speed of the asset sales. And we know with asset sales it's important to find the right buyer, to be patient. It was important for us in Nora. And sometimes it's hard to predict that exact timing, but we have those things in place and the ability to do that.", "Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, guys.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit, BMO Capital Markets.", "Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you, folks. Good morning. Just wanted to revisit your remarks on transport costs and the commissioning phase coming to an end here. When exactly do transport costs peak at $1.20 per M? And what's the progression in unit costs from that point forward? Asking really in an effort to get a better sense of whether the capacity additions are truly a competitive advantage here and what that means for margins and recycle ratios going forward.", "Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.", "Dan, this is Laith. Looking at the transport costs, that will peak at a time when Rover comps on. So if you're looking at that being sometime in the first quarter, it would peak around first or second quarter. And then how quickly we drive that down will simply be dependent on the growth numbers that we've got for 2018, which we'll come out with probably early next year.", "But it sets us up really well, like Ray had mentioned, it gets 70% of our gas headed to the Gulf Coast. And you start to see the benefit of that additional transport really in the fourth quarter. And our fourth quarter differentials improve to $0.28 from $0.51, which we saw in the third quarter. And then looking forward into next year, it improves further to $0.15. So, a massive improvement in differentials, which, to your point, serves to offset that increased transport.", "Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the answer there. North Louisiana DNC costs, a question on that. Wild Horse WRD as well as MRD, that was acquired, stated completed well costs well above the $7.4 million that the company now estimates. What explains the difference in your view? That is, are there any above-ground costs not included in your estimate? Or if the comparison is really apples-to-apples, then what inefficiencies do you think have been squeezed out since taking over operations that would explain the lower costs here?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, it's a great question. And I think when we first looked at the deal, over a year ago, it was at $11.3 million, or I can't remember exactly, but over $11 million well cost. And we predicted early on we could get down to $8.7 million, close to $8 million I think in the acquisition, S-4, or whatever it's called. And essentially, we've been able to get it down to $7.4 million for a 7,500-foot lateral.", "I think a lot of that is people. We brought on board Scott Chesebro, who has a world of experience in high-temperature high-pressure drilling and has optimized some big drilling programs for some big operators in a lot of different basins. So it was a big focus on changing out the team and the people. It was a big focus on implementing some new technologies, new motors, new bits, new mud systems. A lot of that on the drilling side.", "And then the completion side, I would say was more just getting back to a point where \u2013 we just do it different than a lot of them do. We weren't necessarily focused on 30-day IPs and pullback procedures similar to what they had done. So we're doing things differently. I think we're approaching the stimulation designs in execution, especially more like we do in Appalachia, 24/7 operations and a lot of different things like that.", "So I think it's just an overall different long-term approach, much more focused on trying to smooth out the activity level. You can do a much better job when you have a frac crew working for you continuously, rather than bringing them in for two or three weeks and then letting them go for two months and then bringing them back and so forth and so on.", "And I said early on when we announced the deal that we would really be going into 2018 before we could kind of smooth it out and do it \"the Range way.\" And that's really where we are. I think we'll be moving into next year.", "What's important right now is that we've got three frac crews running. We've basically got them fired up just in the last week or two. Everything's right on track in north Louisiana. Third quarter looked good, we just didn't put very many wells online. And so I think we're pretty pleased with what we see going forward there.", "Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Appreciate it. And one last one maybe here just on asset divestitures. What more can you tell us about the contemplated divestitures of the Mid-Con and northeast PA assets, in particular timing? And use of proceeds here? Guessing that it goes right to the balance sheet.", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, use of proceeds to the balance sheet. We have active processes underway. We're actively working on divesting in the Mid-Continent as well as northeast PA. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we'd also consider \u2013 we've got a big acreage position in Pennsylvania, 900,000 surface acres. And in some of those stacked pay areas, if you just look at southwest PA, 1.5 million net acres when you consider not just Marcellus, but Upper Devonian and Utica.", "So we have the Mid-Continent, we have northeast PA. And then to the extent somebody is willing to pay us what we think is a good value for something we're not going to get to for a while and pull some of that value forward, we'd consider that as well.", "Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Got it. Appreciate it. Have a great day. Thank you.", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi.", "Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you. You had mentioned that to fill the total capacity by year end next year in the northeast, that would imply corporate growth of 10%. In that 10% corporate growth, what does that imply for the Terryville growth for Louisiana?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Again, by late this year and early next year, we'll give actual more distinct guidance. But what we're saying is, this year, we allocated about two-thirds of our capital to PA and about a third to north Louisiana. We expect good results and we're having good results in both areas.", "But given the new pipes coming on, we'll probably over-allocate capital to the Marcellus. Use some of that north Louisiana cash flow \u2013 again, the advantage of having two areas \u2013 to help fill pipes.", "So the growth would be disproportionate to PA next year, because we'll be allocating more capital there. We'll give you more color late this year most likely, early next year, which is our typical timeframe for coming out with the budget.", "Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then in the Terryville Field in north Louisiana you took some write-offs for acreage you expect will expire. How many rigs do you need to keep running there to hold the acreage you now anticipate going forward in 2018? I think you're running, is it two or three frac crews and then how many rigs now? And how many do you need to average next year to then hold the acreage and not incur any further write-down on expirations?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Sure, Bob. I'll see if I can hit all those points. I think in Terryville this year, we'll probably average around five rigs. We've had up to three frac crews at different periods. But, again, they've kind of been in compressed timeframes when it's happened. So right now, currently I think we have five rigs running right now. We have three frac crews running there. I do know that for a fact.", "I think next year it will \u2013 like Jeff was alluding to, I think it's probably a little less than that. And hopefully we're at more of a steady pace for frac crews, where we would average something around one crew running most of the year, but probably not all year. Appalachia activity will probably be similar to now, if not a little more.", "Again, we're just formalizing those plans right now. And we'll come out with formal guidance in late this year or early next year, but that's kind of where we see it right now.", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, Bob, this is Roger. Yeah. The expirations, again, we're taking these impairments ahead of the expirations, so these haven't actually expired. So we have a lot of optionality going forward if the drilling results or whatever changes our direction of capital.", "But I would point out that when it comes to acreage, when you look at our proxy peer group, there's four of our peers that have market caps higher than Range whose total acreage positions are less than what we have in north Louisiana. So we have plenty of acreage there to move the needle for us. We're not at all concerned about that.", "Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Sure. I understand that. I was just wondering how many rigs you needed just to hold what you do anticipate not expiring there, but that's good.", "And then I guess just one last quick question. You said that the frac crew showed up couple of weeks late. Is that any indication that the results of just tightness in the market and that crew having to come from, say, some other place like the Permian? Or is it other factors that caused that to be late?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, there's no doubt that the activity levels were up and there's a lot of tightness. There's crews that have probably left from every basin that have hauled on to West Texas, New Mexico, over the last months. Don't expect that's going to change a whole lot. Right now, we're going through the process of putting prices together and bids and awarding contracts. And that will happen for us over the next 30 days or 60 days or so. That's part of putting our formalized plan together to present to the board in December and so forth and so on.", "So I think it's definitely indication of that. And that's simply what it was, the frac crew just tied up for another operator longer than we thought and didn't get to us as quickly as we had thought when we talked about it 90 days ago. As you know, in this business things change a lot in 90 days oftentimes.", "Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, great. Thank you.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc for our final question.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Just under the wire here. Thanks, guys. I guess I'll round out the call with maybe more of a philosophical conversation. Jeff, I wanted to understand a little bit more around your comments. Once you fill the 900 million of incremental pipe capacity coming out of Appalachia, you said a couple things. One, you want to stay below 3 times levered. But, two, that you're going to be focusing more on perhaps under spending cash flows at that point and continuing to delever.", "I guess should we think about it beyond 2018 for Range, that the philosophy will be just to hold that full capacity steady unless commodities would dictate otherwise, where you'd want to significantly start ramping up capacity?", "At that point, should we just be thinking there's obviously the in-Basin option to accelerate. But is the long-term plan here once you get to that full capacity on pipelines to start harvesting some free cash as opposed to even considering growth beyond that full capacity?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "I think the key is, one, again, we'll come out late this year, early next year, with our 2018 plans and maybe a little clearer vision past that. But the important part is I think we're in a great position and we have great flexibility. Again, to fill the pipes next year, 10% year-over-year growth, we can do that for less than cash flow at strip pricing.", "And when you look forward then, we have a lot of flexibility with no new projects coming on. Like Ray said, there's 13 Bs of additional pipeline capacity coming in just to the southwest part of the play over the next couple of years.", "So, we think there's plenty of availability either to sell product in-Basin, which will help reduce and drive down our unit costs that way, or perhaps to pick some of that up and move it to better markets. But because of the high-quality position, peer-leading or one of the best recycle ratios in the business for an oil or gas company, we think we're in a great position with a lot of flexibility.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. I appreciate that. And then the comments around perhaps bringing the value forward outside of non-core assets I guess within the core. Are you considering some pruning within the core of outright sales? Or are you also considering developmental JVs or is it everything is on the table to try to maximize MPV?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah, I think what we're saying is we are open and we're open-minded to what that would be. Of course, we've got the asset sales in the Mid-Continent, northeast PA. But to the extent there's some method or some opportunity out there to pull value forward, we'd certainly be open to that.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks, guys. And best of luck in Q4.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ventura for closing remarks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "I just want to say we really appreciate everybody taking time to be on the call with us this morning.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.", "Statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.", "At this time, I would like to turn over the call to Mr. Laith Sando, Vice President, Investor Relations at Range Resources. Please go ahead, sir.", "Laith Sando - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Range's Year-End Earnings Call. The speakers on today's call are Jeff Ventura, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Walker, Chief Operating Officer; and Roger Manny, Chief Financial Officer.", "Hopefully, you've had a chance to review the press release and updated Investor Presentation that we posted on our website. We also filed our 10-K with the SEC yesterday. It's available on our website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.", "Before we begin, let me also point out that we will be referencing certain non-GAAP measures on today's call. Our press release provides reconciliations of these to the most comparable GAAP figures. In addition, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. The supplemental tables also provide calculated natural gas differentials for the upcoming quarter and detailed hedging information for all products.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thanks, Laith, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on this morning's earnings call. As we begin 2018 and we look at what the next several years hold for Range, we're excited about what we see as we begin to harvest the top tier inventory that we've captured since discovering the Marcellus in 2004. We see this translating into improved returns and free cash flow laid out in our five-year outlook.", "Before we discuss the great opportunity we see going forward, I'd like to acknowledge that our performance in 2017 was not up to Range's standards. While we had outstanding results in the Marcellus, we did not hit our targets in North Louisiana and we all agree yearly results have been disappointing.", "The productivity of the wells has been below our expectations, and this is reflected in the updated type curves that we provided last month. Put simply, the asset has been more geologically complex than anticipated and portions of the core area have been less productive than expected. And while we have a very talented hard-working team overseeing the assets, we are slowing our North Louisiana activity significantly in 2018 and allocating approximately 85% of our capital to the Marcellus.", "By slowing down in North Louisiana, it will allow the team additional time to incorporate our latest technical and production data. By allowing more time running just one rig for the remainder of 2018, we expect the team under new leadership will make improvements. Throughout 2018 and going forward, we will continually assess our capital allocation and make adjustments as needed.", "From where we sit today, running one rig in North Louisiana and focusing the vast majority of our capital towards the Marcellus is the right move for Range. By focusing our capital in the Marcellus, we expect to generate Southwest Pennsylvania growth of 25% in 2018, allowing Range to fully utilize its transportation capacity. The ability to fill our firm transportation commitment so efficiently is a testament to the collaborative efforts of our marketing, planning and operational teams.", "The Marcellus has continued to surprise us to the high side in terms of productivity and efficiency gains, as evidenced by the consistent reserve growth and production results over the last decade with improved type curves over time, most recently in the super-rich area that has continued to outperform our expectations.", "Couple all of this with improving local differentials and a class-leading inventory of 3, 800 wells is why we're allocating approximately 85% of our capital to the Marcellus and why it is the driver behind the five-year outlook we recently provided the market.", "Looking at this five-year outlook and beyond, I believe Range is very well-positioned to drive long-term value for shareholders with the focus on delevering and returning capital to shareholders. As we discussed on the last earnings call, Range has spent the last 10-plus years taking the Marcellus from an idea in a Range conference room to what is now the largest gas field in the country. This commissioning phase for Range is largely complete in 2018 as the last of our natural gas infrastructure projects comes into service, allowing us to deliver natural gas to customers from Appalachia to the Gulf Coast and abroad.", "Over the course of the five-year outlook, we see continued improvements to margins through a combination of improved access to markets and an improved cost structure, driven primarily through better utilization of existing transportation and gathering capacity. Range's five-year outlook delivers an annual production CAGR of approximately 13% on a per share debt-adjusted basis.", "Importantly, the outlook also provides approximately $1 billion in free cash flow and leverage below 2 times by 2022, all at year-end strip pricing and without the benefit of potential asset sales. This not only shows our commitment to spending within cash flow, but also the deliverability of our assets led by the Marcellus where the team has a great track record of delivering consistent results.", "Switching gears and looking at the balance sheet, know that we're committed to prudently improving debt-to-EBITDAX below 3 times as quickly as possible. Like I mentioned, the five-year outlook has us improving leverage organically to under 2 times by 2022 without the benefit of potential asset sales, but our plan is to use asset sales to accelerate the deleveraging process and that's something we are actively pursuing.", "Any additional cash flow from increased commodity prices or additional capital efficiencies will go towards our near-term delevering goals. In 2017, we sold $70 million worth of assets as part of our continual high grading, and we currently have processes underway for additional asset sales.", "In addition to potential asset sales in the Midcontinent and northeast Pennsylvania, we're also looking at ways to pull forward the value on inventory that's not in our near-term plans. Before turning it over to Ray, I'll say what I think distinguishes Range is a very high quality and very large inventory. Evidence of this can be found in our five-year outlook and our recent reserves release.", "At the end of the five-year outlook, Range would still have 3,200 wells remaining in the Marcellus alone. I believe the quality of our inventory is demonstrated in our year-end reserves report where proved reserves were up 26% over the prior year for Range.", "The PV-10 of these reserves was $8.1 billion based on SEC pricing or $9.5 billion using year-end strip pricing. For context, our total enterprise value is trending at a roughly 30% discount to this PV-10, which doesn't include several thousand unbooked Marcellus wells or any of the potential we have in the Utica, Upper Devonian or Lower Cotton Valley. In effect, I see very little, if any, value being ascribed to Range's vast unbooked resource potential. It is on us, the Range team, to prudently and consistently execute and translate this resource potential into shareholder value.", "I'll now turn the call over to Ray to discuss operations.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff. Starting with production, the fourth quarter came in at 2.17 Bcf equivalent per day, which resulted in 30% year-over-year growth. And the first quarter is off to a great start and we expect it to come in at 2.18 Bcf equivalent per day, which is inclusive of some planned MarkWest downtime that happened during January at the Houston complex, involving residue compression maintenance and upgrades for the new Houston 1A plant that's being commissioned soon. This had an impact of about 30 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the quarter for Range. This was built into our 2018 forecast, and I'll add that the MarkWest team did a great job in getting all this work done as planned.", "For the year, annual production guidance is set at 11% and our capital budget for 2018 is reduced from 2017 and is currently planned at $941 million, allocated approximately 85% to our Marcellus assets in southwest Pennsylvania. Around 91% of the total corporate budget this year is directed towards drilling, completion, facilities and pipeline infrastructure.", "Like Jeff mentioned, in our recent reserves release, we reported a 26% increase in proved reserves to 15.3 Tcf equivalent, resulting in a year-end PV-10 reserve value of $9.5 billion using strip pricing from year-end and current sales contracts. Our drill-bit finding costs were $0.31 per Mcfe with 55% of our SEC reserves being proved developed, and our proved developed reserve life of 19 years remains exceptionally strong compared to our peers.", "The average lateral length for existing proved undeveloped wells in the Marcellus increased by 26% to approximately 9,000 feet, with newly added proved undeveloped wells averaging over 9,500 feet. Over the past several years, the lateral lengths of our proved undeveloped locations have continued to progress longer, and I would expect that these lateral lengths, when drilled, will on average be longer than they're currently booked.", "We also had positive performance revisions for 2017, as improvements in well performance in the Marcellus more than offset the underperformance in North Louisiana that we previously discussed. Over the last five years, our reserves have essentially doubled or increased approximately 7 Tcf equivalent, adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures. Page 6 of our presentation on the website provides additional detail on the depth and quality of our Marcellus inventory.", "As we've discussed on previous calls, over the last several years, Range has drilled some excellent wells on the north, southeast and west portions of our southwest Pennsylvania acreage position that further confirm the high quality of our core Marcellus acreage. The consistent success and continued improvement both in short-term rates and longer-term recoveries has all of us here at Range excited about the quality and scope of our future development potential.", "So let me run through some highlights to represent some of the great things going on in Southwest Pennsylvania. During the fourth quarter, we turned in line 42 Marcellus wells averaging over 10,000-foot laterals from 10 different pads. When you look at the 30-day average rate to sales, again, remembering all these wells were under facility constrained conditions, these 42 wells on an average basis produced 23 million cubic feet equivalent per day to sales per each well. And, again, these are 30-day constrained rates and not just peak rates or IPs.", "During the fourth quarter, we had four pads flowing at over 100 million cubic feet equivalent per day each pad to sales. These four pads were over that 100 million a day mark for each pad for periods ranging from 12 days up to 60 days and counting. One of those pads that's in our dry gas area produced to sales at over 170 million a day under constrained conditions for 14 days from five wells averaging 14,384-foot laterals.", "Our corporate base PDP decline for 2018 quarter-four to quarter-four is expected to be approximately 23%. As we progress into 2019, our corporate base PDP decline will be decreasing to approximately 18%, allowing us to hold production flat with much less capital. Our Marcellus PDP decline rate is approximately 20% for 2018 and 17% for 2019.", "As our production becomes more and more dominated by the Marcellus in Southeast Pennsylvania, our corporate decline rate will continue to flatten even more. At the end of our five-year outlook, we expect to be producing in the range of 3.5 Bcf equivalent per day, and we'll have the ability to hold production flat if we choose to with only about $600 million per year of maintenance capital, yielding $1.3 billion in annual free cash flow, as illustrated on slide 14 in the presentation on the website. And importantly, at the end of 2022, we will still have 3,200 high-quality Marcellus wells left to drill. We believe this sets Range apart from our peers.", "On the drilling side, in Southwest Pennsylvania, we drilled 1.1 million lateral feet in 2017, which represents a new record and is a 30% increase in the footage drilled per rig over the prior year. The team drilled our top 15 longest Marcellus lateral lengths in 2017, with several laterals planned for 17,000 to over 18,000 feet in 2018.", "In fact, just this past weekend, the team set pipe on a 17,875-foot Marcellus lateral, and the rig is currently drilling a planned 18,100-foot lateral on the same pad. Our internal industry research shows that we've now drilled the longest Marcellus lateral on record. While the average lateral length drilled in 2017 increased by 34%, importantly, the drilling cost per foot decreased by 16%. These drilling efficiencies have served to offset some of the increased service costs we've seen. This is reflected in our well economics that show improvement on a normalized cost basis in 2018.", "On the completions and operations side of Southwest Pennsylvania, we completed a record 5,302 frac stages in 2017. The average lateral length of wells turned in line increased to 9,102 feet, which is a 42% increase over 2016. The average lateral length of wells turned in line in 2018 is expected to be 10,110 feet or an 11% increase over 2017. For 2018, we expect to drill approximately half of our wells on existing pads, which is up from a third last year.", "The teams' efforts on water recycling have also benefited the company significantly as we are not only servicing our own wells efficiently with some of the lowest well cost in the area, we're also saving money by taking water from other operators in the area, reducing our cost further. On average, we have about $1.4 million in water costs per well, much less than some of our peers. And in Southwest Pennsylvania, our LOE decreased by 9% to $0.10 per Mcfe for 2017.", "Concurrent with our recent reserves, 2018 capital and five-year outlook releases, we updated our type curves and economics in the presentation on the website, representing the average of the wells we expect to turn in line during 2018, as I just mentioned. And again, while we've priced in modest service cost increases of 5% to 10% in 2018, which mostly are on the completions side, we expect the net impact of those increases to be minimal in Southwest Pennsylvania.", "Our technical team is also expanding its work with data analytics and predictive analysis, and we expect to see continued optimization from that work. Longer laterals, going back to existing pads and utilization of existing infrastructure, resulting in lower unit cost will also contribute to better economics and efficiencies in the coming years.", "And finally, while not a lot of companies talk about it, I'm really proud of our teams all across the company when it comes to safety and environmental compliance. We had a great year in safety for 2017 with no days away-from-work and only one recordable incident for Range employees, taking us closer and closer to our goal of zero incidents and sending all of our employees and contractors home safely to their families each and every day.", "On the environmental front, we focus each day on operating in an environmentally safe manner. For example, we've focused on minimizing methane emissions over the last several years. From facilities designed to testing protocols, we've made it a priority and have shared our efforts in the field with state and federal regulators. I am pleased to report that Range was recently recognized as a top performer in the area of emissions by As You Sow in its annual report, which can be found on our website.", "Shifting now to North Louisiana, like Jeff said, the results we've seen thus far were not up to our standards. Our current plan is to run one rig for the remainder of 2018 with one frac crew on and off during the year as timing dictates. We'll continue to monitor capital and results and make adjustments as necessary. We'll continue to take what we learned throughout 2017 and integrate key drivers, such as landing target, job intensity, proppant placement, and stage spacing in the various layers in the Lower Cotton Valley.", "We're incorporating seismic attribute data from the new shoots that we received near year-end and have developed more stringent reservoir and earth modeling. Bottom line, we're going slower and we have a dedicated technical team focused on improving the results we've seen to-date.", "Shifting to marketing, during both the fourth quarter of 2017 and in early 2018, incremental firm pipeline takeaway capacity out of Southwest PA has commenced operations, which should improve our corporate differential significantly going forward. These projects include Enbridge's Tetco Adair Southwest Project, which went into service late in the fourth quarter, and TransCanada's Leach and Rayne XPress projects, which went into full service January 1 this year. And by the end of the second quarter when Rover is expected to be online, over 90% of Range's production will be directed towards price-advantaged markets.", "Importantly, these additions to Range's transportation portfolio reduce basis volatility, especially during the seasonally weak months of July to October and should increase the predictability of Range's corporate natural gas differential going forward.", "Looking at near-term Appalachia supply and demand, our internal work shows that when you look at the natural gas takeaway projects that have come into service since the third quarter of 2017, only about half of that volume is new gas, with the other half simply being local gas that was being displaced. More broadly, storage levels are likely to end the winter season between 1.4 and 1.5 Tcf, which will require a significant injection season to bring storage levels closer in line with the five-year average by the end of October.", "At current forward pricing levels, coal-to-gas switching is incentivized, providing additional demand upside. Longer term, from the third quarter of 2017 through the end of 2019, we expect Southwest Appalachia takeaway to grow by approximately 12 Bcf a day with an additional 1.5 Bcf a day of demand growth from Cove Point and new gas power plant (21:32) over the same time period.", "Consensus production estimates for Southwest Appalachian producers points to growth of 6.2 Bcf per day over the same time period at prices ranging from $3.07 to $3.09 per Mcf with WTI at $60 per barrel. And, of course, the current strip is not that high and might not support that level of growth. All of this supports the potential for improving local prices.", "We're also seeing strong global LNG demand and we believe the U.S. is well-positioned to supply that increased demand. And specifically for Range, we believe our high-quality inventory and transportation portfolio positions us well to access this future demand growth.", "Shifting to liquids, Range produced record volumes of NGLs in the fourth quarter of 2017 with total net NGL production of 106,038 barrels per day, up 24% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter, making Range one of the largest independent NGL producers in the U.S.", "In fact, almost one-third of Range's expected revenue in 2018 comes from natural gas liquids, providing us leverage to improving liquids pricing, as evidenced in our five-year outlook sensitivities. As shown in the company presentation, if WTI were to average $60 over the five-year period versus strip pricing, which is closer to $54, Range would add an additional $700 million in cash flow over the next five years.", "A significant portion of Range's ethane and propane volumes are being delivered to premium market segments via Range's advantaged access to international destinations. Fourth quarter Appalachian ethane gross prices were up about $0.25 per gallon, representing a 119% premium to local natural gas markets before hedging, and C3 plus NGL gross prices were $42 a barrel or 76% of WTI before hedging.", "Propane, in particular, benefited from improving domestic and international fundamentals, with Range's realized prices up 59% over the same period in the prior year. Our top-tier inventory of liquids-rich assets have us well-positioned to supply both domestic and international projects coming on stream throughout this decade and the next.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger to discuss the financials.", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you, Ray. Reviewing the Form 10-K one final time last week, I could not help but notice the SEC required disclosure table on page 45. This table, as presented in all 10-Ks, sets forth the past five years of financial performance. Page 45 of the Range 10-K illustrates that since 2013, production has essentially doubled, proved reserves have essentially doubled, total unit costs per Mcfe have roughly been cut in half, profitability has been restored, cash flow from hedges has largely been replaced by cash flow from operations. Yet at year-end 2013, our market cap was 175% of our SEC PV-10 and currently our market cap is 41% of our SEC PV-10. This disclosure was a stark reminder that there are times when financial and operating performance have little bearing on stock price performance, and this is one of those times.", "Now looking at the fourth quarter, revenues, net income and cash flow were above the third quarter and higher than the fourth quarter of last year. Despite late pipes and challenging operating conditions, production guidance was met and consensus estimates were exceeded. Fourth quarter cash flow was $260 million, slightly higher than last year. Full year 2017 cash flow totaled $916 million, a 61% increase from 2016.", "Fourth quarter EBITDAX was $309 million and full year 2017 EBITDAX totaled $1.1 billion, 53% higher than last year. Fully diluted cash flow per share for the fourth quarter was $1.06, while full year 2017 cash flow per fully diluted share was $3.73, 24% higher than full year 2016.", "As Laith mentioned, please reference the earnings release and supplemental tables on the Range website for full reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP.", "Cash margin for the fourth quarter at $1.29 per Mcfe was higher than the third quarter and full-year cash margin at $1.24 per Mcfe was 26% better than the full year 2016 figure. We look forward to our remaining pipeline capacity coming online during the first half of 2018, which will help stabilize our margins as basis volatility has reduced.", "GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $220 million and GAAP net income for the full year was $331 million. Adjusting fourth quarter GAAP net income using common analyst methodology, which removes non-cash and non-recurring items, was $55 million or $0.22 per fully diluted share. Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the full year was $143 million or $0.58 per share.", "Reviewing significant unit cost structure variances for the fourth quarter, transportation, gathering and processing came in $0.05 per Mcfe favorable to guidance due to in-service (27:56) dates on several new pipelines. The offset to this cost improvement was a $0.07 wider forecast to gas price differential as pipeline takeaway capacity access to better price markets was delayed.", "Reflecting the reallocation of capital from North Louisiana to Appalachia, we increased our estimate of expiring North Louisiana acreage, resulting in a $218 million non-cash impairment of unproved properties. Other unit costs were below or in line with guidance.", "While not a specific guidance item, I wish to mention that Range, like most all other publicly traded companies, will be adopting the new GAAP accounting standard for revenue recognition in the first quarter of 2018. Under this new accounting standard, costs associated with certain gathering and processing arrangements that are currently netted against revenue will be re-classed to expense.", "There is no increase in actual cost with this new accounting standard, only a reclassification between revenue and expense. The result will be an increase in revenue and an identical increase in gathering, transportation and processing expense. I will update guidance to reflect this change and provide a reconciliation between the old and new accounting standards in April.", "Over on the balance sheet, as Jeff stated, we have a plan in place to orderly reduce our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio over time, and we intend to bring down leverage ratio faster than our five-year outlook forecast with asset sales. In the meantime, Range continues to have ample liquidity with over $500 million in committed availability under its bank credit facility.", "Consistent with our past practice, Range has continued to add to its hedge position during the fourth quarter with over 70% of our anticipated 2018 natural gas production hedged at a forward price of $3.09 per Mcf and over 70% of our projected oil production hedged with a forward price of $53.30 a barrel. Details of our current hedge positions across all of our products may be found in the earnings release, Range website and 10-K.", "In summary, the fourth quarter showed steady progress with higher production, cash flow and net income. The full year financial performance for 2017 was markedly better than 2016, with EBITDAX back up over $1 billion and unit cost held in check.", "Jeff, back to you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Ventura. First question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, good morning, everyone.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Good morning.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "I'll start with a philosophical question, I guess. So, as you guys mentioned, you are trading well below PV-10. Why do you think that that is? And what do you think that you can do to address it? I know it's kind of a tough question, but if you could take a shot.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. Well, let me take a shot at it. It's a good question. I think, one, it \u2013 we'll talk about the macro and Range specific. But, one, I think people are typically bearish natural gas right now and if they're into the commodity, probably more on the oil side. Later on, all right, we can do it as a follow-up question if you want, I can address the macro and maybe paint a little bit better picture. But I think the macro is part of that.", "I think the other part of it, quite frankly, like we said, are two things. Our leverage is high relative to peers and the results in Terryville have been disappointing, like we said. To address those two things specifically, I think when you look at our leverage, we have a five-year outlook that we put out that I think is a good solid plan led by the Marcellus and I think we really have outstanding high quality rocking team work in the Marcellus to drive that plan.", "So to address the leverage specifically, and it's on page 12 of presentation if you look at it, assuming no asset sales and we are actively pursuing asset sales, by 2020, assuming strip pricing, we get debt-to-EBITDAX below 3 times. I think that's important. Importantly, on that same page, we ran a couple of sensitivities. If you assume the strip is correct for gas, but just assume WTI is $60, so currently it's trading over $60 and the strip long-term is a little under that, but if WTI is $60, debt-to-EBITDAX accelerates getting below 3 times from 2020 to 2019. Not that far out. And then, again, to the extent we're successful with our assets sales, we have the opportunity to pull that into 2018. I think that will be a key event for us there in terms of getting valuation back.", "And, again, you can, same thing, debt-to-EBITDAX below 2 times on a five-year outlook, 2020, it's 2022. WTI is $60, pulls it to 2021, asset sales would pull that below 2 times to 2020. I think that's important. On that same page, too, with that I talked about debt-to-EBITDAX, but it also increases our free cash flow by 70% or $700 million, as Ray said and, of course, that gives us a great free cash flow yield of greater than 40%, given where we trade.", "So I think those are important things. In terms of North Louisiana, we talked about. Partly we're addressing the results there. We're slowing down. We're going down to one rig. We think that's the right thing and we're really redirecting the bulk of our cash flow up into the Marcellus, which we also think is the right thing. So it gives us time to slow down, see where we are in Louisiana. At the same time, we're having phenomenal results in Pennsylvania. Ray talked about some of them. We expect that that will continue.", "So it recognizes the great results we have in PA. Also with all that new transportation that's coming on in PA, we expect the prices to come in a little bit, give us better net back in pricing, and through redirecting existing volumes coupled with the focus, the capital there allows us to fulfill our transportation commitments. So we think those are the reasons I think we're trading below \u2013 to answer question specifically, those are the things that we're doing specifically to address them.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thanks. Appreciate the detailed answer. And then in the prepared comments, you talked about pulling forward value outside of the asset sales that you've talked about in the Mid-Con and in Northeast PA. Is that just more asset sales or are you thinking about other structures like JVs or something along those lines to do that?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, it's great question, too. So there's multiple things we're looking at and multiple options in order to help us delever and pull forward value. If you look at the position we have in Southwest PA, we have a big position, we have a big footprint. Importantly, we hold all horizons with any well. So, it's not just the Marcellus, but it's the Utica, the Upper Devonian and within that big footprint. To the extent there's value in some of those horizons or value in inventory that's far out there that we could pull forward that we think is a fair price, we certainly would consider that and do that.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Next question from Holly Stewart from Scotia Howard. Your line is open.", "Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Good morning.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Good morning.", "Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil", "Maybe the first one, either for Jeff or Ray. I'm just curious what specifically are you looking for? I mean, I think you completed roughly 20 wells in North Louisiana in the fourth quarter. So, I guess, what are you looking for as you watch those wells? And then how are you thinking about the changes to the completion design in 2018?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Let me start at a high-level then I'll flip it over to Ray. Again, what we're doing is recognizing the below performance that we've experienced. So, if you go back to 2017, we talked about what the results were for the first-half wells. And although the second-half 2017 wells were significantly better, they're still below what we were targeting.", "So last year, we ran four rigs and at times more than four rigs \u2013 six or seven rigs, in a spot period, we've cut back. Today, we're at two rigs. In a week, we'll be at one and we'll stay at one rig for the rest of the year. So I think going slower is important.", "We've changed leadership. We're incorporating all the knowledge that we have to do that. And at the same time, we're redirecting our capital up to the Marcellus where we've had great results, consistent results. And if anything, it just keeps surprising us to the high side. So we think that's the right way to allocate capital and it's the right pace to go at in Louisiana. But, Ray, you want to hone in on some of the specifics on what we're going to do on the one-rig program?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Sure, sure. It's a great question, Holly. I think what's important to point out and all the things Jeff said, I totally agree with and is exactly why we've moved most of our capital to Appalachia because they've had great success up there and things have improved in longer laterals and capital efficiencies and just all the things we are seeing happen there.", "When you look at the last batch of wells that we did, like Jeff said, they're way better than the wells we did in the first half of the year, but they still didn't reach what our expectation was going in. But there were a few wells that did and there were a few isolated cases. I think some wells we announced back \u2013 last September that were at the tight curve have continued to perform well. We drilled the best Lower Deep Pink well in the field today and so there's a few things there that we want to do some more testing.", "We experimented with some different job sizes, stage spacing, cluster designs, proppant intensity, different things like that that we experimented with over that last batch of wells. And so we literally need to slow down, let the team focus on some technical analysis of all that data, decide what worked, why it worked and what didn't work and why it didn't work, build some models and look at the different areas that we're going to be looking at. But, again, we're going a whole lot slower. It's a lot less capital and, again, pulling in new leadership and a different focus on it going forward.", "Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil", "Okay, great. Maybe could you just expound on the new leadership comment?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Sure. John Applegath, who is leading that division, have retired earlier this year. John did a lot of great things for the company and he was approaching his 70th birthday and was ready to go. And we have promoted Dennis Degner to Senior Vice President. Dennis is going to be overseeing both divisions day to day. Dennis has a lot of great experience as a background and a lot of the efficiencies and the successes we're seeing in the Marcellus are a direct result of Dennis' work up there. So we're going to be still focusing on Appalachia. And like you say, 85% or more of his time is still Appalachia and that's where the lion's share and the engine and our whole five-year plan is based on. But, clearly, we're going to pull in, slow down and put a lot more technical analysis in the North Louisiana assets going forward.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "And I'd add to that a little bit. Dennis has done a great job for us running operations for a long time there, now be in-charge of both divisions. Again, still focused on making sure we're doing a great job up in Appalachia as well as trying to pick up what we're doing in Louisiana.", "Curt Tipton is going to run our division up in South Point. Curt's been with us a long time, does a fantastic job. I have great confidence in Curt and his ability and the team up there, great depth there. And then Scott Chesebro will replace John Applegath to run the North Louisiana division. Scott has a great track record. He spent a lot of time with Anadarko, actually worked that area and did a lot of the drilling in and around Vernon when Anadarko was running a lot of rigs, and then later on, did a lot of things worldwide for Anadarko. So Scott has a great track record, great resume, and we think under that team, working under Dennis will do great things.", "Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil", "That's great. And maybe just for my last question. Can you just remind us of the total firm pipeline commitments and then kind of when during 2018 you expect to have those filled?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, we had three pipeline projects coming on. And when you look at the three pipeline projects, one of them came on in the fourth quarter, one of them literally like January 1. The last of the three is Rover. Rover should be on \u2013 we'll defer to Energy Transfer and the comments that they made on when Rover is going to come on. So, it'd be early second quarter, maybe, I think is what they're saying.", "When you look at our ability to, again, move existing volumes into the pipeline as well as the new drilling, we think that we'll do a good job of filling that transportation this year and have really over 90% of our natural gas going to good markets. And that's part of \u2013 when you look at the Range story, I was talking a lot early on, I quoted a lot of the numbers out of the five-year plan.", "The other thing that's I think important to look at on the presentation, and I'm seeing if I can flip through it and find it real quick, I think it may be in the appendix. But we have with our \u2013 differentials are for natural gas, for NGLs and for condensate. And again, you see continued improvement in 2018 in all three areas, and a lot of that is a result of the transportation and efficiently using the transportation. The IR team, I'm sure, can give you guidance to what they are, plus it's in the presentation.", "Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil", "That's great. Thanks, guys.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question from Adam Meyers from Cowen. Your line is open.", "Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Good morning.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Good morning.", "Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC", "I guess, maybe just starting with the five-year growth outlook here. I'm curious if you could give us any kind of background as to how Range arrived at kind of 11% as the optimal long-term growth rate to hit your leverage targets. I'm talking to some investors, it sounds like some could be wondering why it's not a lower growth rate, potentially throw off some more cash. So, any thoughts you have on that would be interesting.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. I mean, that's a great question. And when you look at the plan, there were several things we're looking at. Again, it's driven by the Marcellus. It's driven by wells we have high confidence in, in terms of being able to hit the results and targets. I think that the team did a job in terms of when you look at 2018 and 2019, very reasonable assumptions. We really didn't build in efficiencies until you go out to year three, four and five. And the efficiencies we built in were pretty minor. There are things that we see today that are in hand. We assume lateral lengths no longer than 10,000 feet, even though in reality we'll probably do that. So, we think we have a good plan that's well-built and we tied it to strip pricing.", "When you look at it, there's a variety of things that you need to look at in order to build the plan. We ran multiple sensitivities. Of course, Holly just asked on the previous question about the transportation we have and filling transportation. So this plan fills transportation, it meets transportation. And when you look at it, it delevers us over time and then throws off a significant amount of free cash flow over time with those rates.", "So we're living at or below the cash flow estimates and different pricing estimates. We ran some different sensitivities to show you, again, on page 12, throws off $1.7 billion at $60 WTI and gas strip. That's a 40% free cash flow yield. Those are commitments. It does a lot of good things for us. And of course, we'll continue to look to optimize it with time and to see what the most optimum thing to do is. But it delevers us and then it gives us the optionality with time to either increase dividend or buy back shares.", "Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Right. That makes sense. And then maybe sticking with the five-year plan, deleveraging obviously a key component. Any way that you can give us a sense as to the level of interest you're seeing for some of these non-core assets and maybe just how much an asset sale could accelerate the timeframe for deleveraging?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Like I said, when you do asset sales, it's really important you've got to find the right buyer. I think I'd give examples with various people in the past and good examples for us would be Nora or Bradford County assets. You have to be disciplined and you have to find the right buyer. Again, I'll keep referring to page 12, with no asset sales, debt-to-EBITDAX gets below 3x at 2020. WTI \u2013 gas stays at strip and you look at WTI at $60, it accelerates to 2019. If we're successful this year with asset sales, we could pull it into 2018.", "Adam Meyers - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Well, okay. Very interesting. Great quarter. Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question from Mike Kelly of Seaport Global. Your line is open.", "Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Good morning.", "Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "You just kind of touched on it, Jeff, but really I want to look at slide 8 that shows kind of your organic deleverage and wanted to get your sense on what you'd like this chart to look like with asset sales, specifically kind of 2020 metrics, where you'd like that to be?", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. When you look at slide 8, again, it shows debt-to-EBITDAX below 3 times in 2020 and below 2 times in 2022. I'd like it to be sub-3 times near term. And a little bit of price improvement, successful asset sales this year, we could get there. So we'll try as hard as we can and focus on that and basically it's pulling the blue bars forward on slide 8 a year, preferably two years.", "Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Got it. Okay. And switching gears. Ray, you hit on the supply/demand dynamics in the Northeast gas market. What kind of stood out to me was that you expect pipeline capacity growth kind of 2x what you see as production growth out of the Basin through the end of \u2013 I think it was the end of 2019. I was curious if you could give us a little bit more color on your projections on that supply growth front. You gave like a 6 Bcf a day number and just want to hear a little bit more detail on this \u2013 on that analysis that encompasses everybody that's up there, anything you give on that front would be helpful. Thanks.", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. What we did is, of course, it's all internal work. And we looked at third quarter \u2013 took the timeframe from the third quarter of 2017 through the end of 2019, which isn't that far away. I mean, it sounds long ways out there, but it's the end of next year. And when you look at that, we've got pretty good line of sight on the pipes (48:30) that are going to happen and I think there's pretty much a lot of confidence in that. Certainly with the current administration and FERC commission, all that looks positive.", "So there's about 12 Bs a day when you sum all that up. We simply took basically the consensus estimates and public data of the Southwest Basin producers, both Utica and Marcellus in the areas that would be connected to those pipes. And, again, we're completely holding Northeast PA out. I think that's a totally different animal up there. But if we look at the producers that are connected to those pipes and what they've publicly said and what consensus estimates are built around, it's about a little over 6 to maybe 6.5 Bs a day of growth that everybody is projecting from the third quarter of 2017 through the end of 2019, so with the same time period.", "So this is following I think what we've seen historically in this industry over the last almost 40 years I've been doing this is that infrastructure always gets overbuilt. Now the question becomes what happens, and I would also say that 6.2 Bs of gas is at a pretty healthy consensus price of basically over $3. I think it's $3.07 to $3.09 on a consensus basis that people were predicting that kind of growth. With the strip at $2.85, $2.75 or where it's today, it's not there. And clearly that could put that growth level at risk.", "So we think, like we said for a long time, that there's going to be ample pipeline takeaway gas capacity in the Basin. It's going to be overbuilt. We think demand pull will start occurring. We already have a lot of that taking place. Even on the liquid side, it's beginning to take place where markets are actually coming to us to buy the gas at the tailgate of the Houston plant, so to speak. So we see a lot of that shift beginning to take place, just like we predicted it would for years. And I think that's kind of how we put all that together internally.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "I'd just add to that a little bit. When you look out further into that 2020 or 2020 plus, we really believe based on our internal work that you're going to see sweet spot exhaustion in the Marcellus, Utica as well as in a lot of other plays really all over the county, which is really important when you look at people projecting forward. And then it comes back to who has an inventory that can last. And, again, we think with the quality, the acreage we have and the large number of locations that are in the sweet spot that will put us in a great position. But that's something that I think is not in the market, but it's a real technical factor.", "Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Got it. And just if you had a ballpark number for the amount of volumes that could come from private operators in the region, is that \u2013 it might not even be meaningful, but do you a sense of that, too?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "I don't think we really have a sense of that.", "Roger S. Manny - Range Resources Corp.", "That's in the data, and it's factored into the analysis.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "It's in that number. These are our internal numbers. Within the number, that's included. So it's the public and private people that are collectively incorporated into that.", "Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "All right. Appreciate it, guys. Great details.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from David Deckelbaum of KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Good morning, Jeff and everyone. Thanks for taking my questions here.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Good morning.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Just wanted to ask just on the portfolio management process. You all have put together a compelling five-year growth plan, returning capital to shareholders. You've talked about some asset sales. One, I'm wondering, just how now Terryville fits into everything. I understand the process you're going through this year, you'd analyze what you could improve upon. But, I guess, when I think back to when you all made the acquisition in 2016 versus now, it certainly doesn't seem that you need the Terryville in your portfolio relative to the opportunity that you have in the Marcellus.", "So, one, I'm trying to get a sense of how long the evaluation process might take and how long you'd like to stick with it before potentially looking to monetize Terryville and kind of attempt to pull some of that value forward. And then, I guess, at the same time, I imagine that this year I wanted to get a sense of how much free cash Terryville is generating in the 2018 plan. And if you would more rather appreciate sort of an underinvested free cash generation coming out of Terryville to sort of supplement a little bit more of the total enterprise over the next couple of years.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Yeah. I mean, in essence, that's what we're doing. We're dialing back Terryville to one rig, so we're basically taking all of our cash flow and some cash flow from there and reinvesting it up into the Marcellus for the reasons that you're saying.", "So I think the key is, the results \u2013 again, first half results were disappointing in 2017. Second half better, but still not where we want them to be. We've slowed down significantly. We're allocating some of that cash flow up to Pennsylvania to help us achieve great results and fill pipes and do all the things that we're doing there. And then I think the key is what do the results look like as we go through the year. And there's different things to look at and there's different analogies that you could use.", "One analogy is Northeast Pennsylvania. Northeast Pennsylvania has good returns and is a strong asset, but, again, where we allocate more capital. Right now, we're allocating to Southwest Pennsylvania. And other good example might be people \u2013 if you go back just a couple of years, which isn't that long, and you look at Southwest Pennsylvania specifically, we have the dry, the wet and the super-rich. And I remember we put out economics of those three areas, and the economics at that point in time were the super-rich and the wet were about half the economics of the dry and we got a lot of pressure from people, why in the world would you put any money into the super-rich or the wet, look at the economics in the dry.", "And fortunately, we kept putting some money into it and we understood it better. And you look at where we are today and the type curves are significantly better and the team's done a good job. But we'll clearly look at it and we'll look at like we have historically where are our returns, how important are the different pieces to the portfolio and, therefore, what should we do? Do we keep it? Do we allocate capital to it? Do we sell it? I think that's just typically what we've done as we've managed the portfolio over time. We look at real-time data and make what we think is the right decision for capital allocation.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And, I guess, the only follow-up to that, I guess, is when you look at the split of assets that contribute to free cash generation, you talked about $1 billion or so cumulative in five years. At what point does the Marcellus generate more free cash than Terryville does?", "Ray N. Walker, Jr. - Range Resources Corp.", "Well, I'll take a stab at it. By virtue of \u2013 at the end of that time period, Terryville is declining this year, like we talked about in the outlook and then we're holding it flat 2019 going forward and virtually all the growth is coming out of the Marcellus. So the Marcellus dominates basically starting this year all of those factors. So I think it just becomes smaller and smaller each year as it goes forward and the big lion's share of it's going to be the economics in Southwest Pennsylvania.", "David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Appreciate the responses, everyone.", "Jeffrey L. Ventura - Range Resources Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Ventura for concluding remarks.", "Jeffrey L.
