At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Joshua Zable, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Joshua Zable", "Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2016 and full year conference call. I would like to remind you that an earnings slide deck presentation relating to this call is available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com. Before we begin please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slides 2 and 3 of our earnings slide presentation. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results.", "We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.", "And with that, I will now turn the program over to Jeffrey Slovin, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Thanks, Josh. It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. Also joining us on the call today Uli Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "In 2016, we delivered on our most challenging strategic objectives. We began successfully integrating our organization, met our financial guidance and captured synergy targets. 2017 will be a pivotal year for our organization, as we execute on plans that will create shareholder value, for years to come. In 2016, we finished the year with 2.4% internal growth. Our growth came in the face of challenging market conditions. Political instability and lower oil prices impacted merging market economies like Russia Brazil and the Middle East. The Brexit vote added uncertainty in Europe, the U.S. dental markets slowed down unexpectedly from summer until late in the year.", "Our diversification in both geography and product portfolio is proving to be a competitive advantage. Coming together at the right time enabled us to accelerate growth through early revenue synergies.", "For the full year, we delivered adjusted EPS of $2.78, representing solid net income growth. I am proud of the team's ability to work together to compensate for lower than expected revenues, we delivered earnings at the higher end of our guidance range.", "In 2016, we made substantial progress integrating our two businesses. We developed and implemented our first revenue synergy programs, we began reducing cost to make us a more efficient organization and we reinvested some of the savings into growth initiatives. These efforts put us in a better position in 2017 and will enable us to unlock significant value as we move forward. We remain on time and on track to deliver over $125 million in synergies by the end of year three. We have begun to realize revenue synergies through programs and solutions that we are uniquely positioned to deliver to customers.", "Commercial strategies such as bundling and loyalty programs began rolling out in middle of 2016. We are seeing stronger acceptance of them. This will drive increased demand for our products in 2017. We have also implemented cost reduction programs that have begun to pay dividends. And will continue to bear fruit next year. The merger gave us an opportunity to reevaluate our supply chain. We have proposed and initiated plans to reorganize manufacturing, logistics, and distribution networks in multiple places, including large areas like Germany and Brazil. The efficiency created will enable further reinvestment in the business.", "While also delivering savings to our shareholders. This undertaking began in 2016, but we will only begin to realize the benefits in late 2017 and 2018. Our procurement team is leveraging our size and scope to get better terms from vendors. We expect to see savings layout over the course of this year and the next. We have made considerable progress in bringing our commercial organizations together. This will both increase our level of collaboration and provide more value to our customers. In almost all of the countries in which we operate, we have implemented organizational structures and processes that provide strong product specific focus and leverage our combined market presence in common cost-based. As cross functional teams come together, we will realize the savings of consolidating multiple offices into central locations, leveraging resources and eliminating redundancies.", "Many of these plans have been implemented, we will see some benefits in 2017 and realize even more in 2018. With regard to tax, our merger has already created multiple benefits. Coming together has also unlocked capital deployment synergies. As promised, we delivered $500 million share repurchases shortly after our merger closed.", "During the quarter, we bought an additional 119 million in stock bringing our total buyback to over $800 million for 2016. And less than one year between buybacks and dividends, we returned nearly $900 million in capital to our shareholders. We also completed the acquisition of MIS Implants. MIS represents our first entry into the 1.5 billion faster growing value implant segment. We are pleased with the performance of MIS to-date. We continue to evaluate and gauge on a number of attractive acquisition targets and expect to be active in this area again in 2017.", "Now turning to our fourth quarter results. For the quarter, we grew over 4.3% constant currencies supported by the addition of MIS Implants with internal growth of 1.8%, driven by strong growth in rest of world and in Europe. Rest of world delivered 9.4% internal growth, led by a particularly strong quarter in technologies. Europe grew 5.1%, which we also believe is well above market. Both, our technologies and consumable segments grew. In the U.S., lower technology sales led to a decline of 7%. In November, the decision to change our relationship with our exclusive equipment partner in the U.S. was announced. For 20 years, we have had a unique relationship with Patterson in North America.", "Patterson has been a major proponent for the digitalization of dentistry and the Sirona product line particularly CEREC and Schick. In 2012, we further expanded our exclusive relationship and together we drove the increased adoption of digital technologies. We share the view with Patterson that broadening our go-to-market strategy in North America will accelerate the adoption of our technologies.", "Our decision to redefine and broaden our go-to-market strategy in no way diminishes our commitment to grow with Patterson. Our partnership with Patterson is extremely important to us and we highly value them as partners going forward. We have done extraordinary things together, and we will both benefit as demand for digital technologies reaches the tipping point.", "As a result of this decision and the transition to a non-exclusive relationship later this year, we sold less product to Patterson in Q4. In large part as they began to reduce inventories in North America. We expect this trend to continue in the first half of 2017 as the relationship transitions. We believe the change in our go-to-market strategy will begin reaping benefits in growth and accelerating market penetration later this year and into 2018 and beyond. I will comment more on this later, excluding the impact of these actions, the growth of our U.S. business improved from the first nine months rate.", "Sticking with the U.S. market, our chairside consumable business saw accelerating sales through trends in the quarter. We see this as an encouraging sign relative to the market and also relative to our underlying performance. We saw improvement in the end markets through the quarter with stronger user sales in December that also carried through to January. We believe the U.S. market is stable, but is showing signs of improvement. Internal growth for our technology segment was flat in the fourth quarter, driven by declines in the U.S., offset its growth in Europe and the rest of the world. Dental and health care consumables were up 3.5% internally for the quarter. We grew across our all three regions. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.67. I will now turn the call over to Uli, who will review our fourth quarter financials and outlook.", "Uli Michel", "Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. This morning, I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. In the fourth quarter, our reported revenue increased $325.4 million to $996.5 billion, up 48.5%. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals grew 4.3% on a constant currency basis. Internal growth was 1.8% excluding a 270 basis points favorable impact from net acquisitions.", "Jeff already mentioned that as a result of the move to broaden our North American go-to- market strategy, channel inventories were reduced by approximately $30 million or 300 basis points. Foreign exchange movements were a headwind to revenue of 70 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if the merger had been completed on January 1, 2015. Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segments. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together. U.S. GAAP gross profit was $541.5 million up $166.8 million or 44.5% from $374.7 million in 2015.", "Gross profit as a percentage of net sales excluding precious metal content decreased by 290 basis points to 55.1% from 58% in the prior year, as you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 310 basis points mostly due to the effect of step-up amortization and other merger-related items.", "On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 58.2%, down 60 basis points for the quarter. Unfavorable product mix and foreign currency impacts offset the benefits of savings from the cost reduction programs and favorable product pricing.", "Reported SG&A expenses, which includes R&D was $399.7 million, up $131.9 million, or 49.2% versus last year. This equates to 40.7% of sales, excluding precious metals, 80 basis points below prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of Sirona's lower operating expense rate, and savings from the cost reduction programs, partially offset by increased amortization expense and other costs related to the merger.", "Adjusted for non-GAAP items, including amortization expense and other costs related to the merger, SG&A expense was $366.7 million, or 37.3% of sales excluding precious metals, representing a 160 basis point improvement. This ratio was largely unaffected by foreign exchange. Restructuring expenses were $7.6 million, down from $13.8 million last year.", "In total GAAP operating income was $134.2 million, up $41.1 million, or 44.1% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 21%, up 110 basis points compared to 19.9% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of cost reduction programs and the consolidation of Sirona. FX had a negative impact of approximately 20 basis points on the rate.", "Net interest and other expense for the fourth quarter declined by $19 million, compared to prior year, the biggest driver of the decline was the absence of bond issuance cost in the current period.", "For the three months ended December 31, 2016, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $24.6 million versus $13.8 million last year. During Q4, the Company recorded $8.1 million of tax expense related to discrete tax matters. Excluding these tax matters, the Company's effective tax rate was 20.2%.", "The Q4 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by an update of our annual effective tax rate to 20.8%, this compares to approximately 23% last year. Our lower tax rate is a benefit resulting from the complementary tax attributes of the merged companies.", "Q4 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona was $107 million, up 82.6% from the prior year. Fourth quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.46 compared to $0.41 in the prior year.", "Adjusted non-GAAP net income grew 70.7% to $158.1 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.67, compared to $0.65 last year. Net income growth more than offset the impact of additional share issuance related to the merger. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release.", "Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $222.4 million compared to $126.4 million last year. Q4 2016 operating cash flows were positively impacted by decreases in working capital.", "Cash used in investing activities was $46.6 million compared to $68.1 million in the prior year. The sum of operating and investing cash flows resulted in free cash flow of $175.8 million versus $58.3 million last year. The free cash flow of $175.8 million represents 111% of our adjusted net income. Cash flow from financing activities was $112.7 million outflow versus an outflow of $8.9 million last year.", "In Q4 2016, we returned approximately $137 million to our shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. We repaid borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issued $300 million in new long-term debt, as noted on our last quarterly conference call, on October 27, we issued EUR315 million of private placement notes with tenures between eight and 15 years and a weighted average interest rate of 1.4%. The Company ended the quarter with a cash balance of $383.9 million. As you can see, we finished our fiscal year with a solid financial performance.", "Now turning to guidance. For fiscal 2017, we expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.80 to $2.90. Our guidance includes the following assumptions. Constant currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%, this includes approximately 150 basis points of the net benefit from acquisitions and divestitures, implying internal growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues excluding precious metals of $3.95 billion to $4.03 billion. We expect to reduce our effective tax rate to 20% in 2017.", "Our EPS range implies a full year diluted share count of approximately $231 million to $233 million shares versus the $222 million in 2016. This reflects approximately $0.15 headwind at the midpoint and is simply a function of the timing of the merger. At the current exchange rates, we would estimate FX headwinds of $0.08 to $0.10 for 2017. As mentioned, we are broadening our go-to-market strategy in North America. The midpoint of our guidance implies that by the end of 2017, the markets will be served with approximately $50 million less channel inventory than today. The first half should see deeper inventory reductions, which will be partially offset by increases in the second half of 2017.", "Putting all of this together for the full year, represents more than 120 basis points growth headwind. Once our new strategy is fully implemented, we expect growth in North America to accelerate again. Lastly, also keep in mind that IDS is at the end of March. In the months leading up to the international dental show, we typically experience lower equipment sales in Europe, which impacts our Q1 results.", "I will now turn the call back to Jeff.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Thanks, Uli. As we look to 2017, we remain confident about the opportunities ahead of us. Our market is attractive and growing. Dentistry's expansion is supported by sustainable long-term demographic trends, growth can ebb and flow from one quarter to one year to the next, but increasing demand for oral care supports a long-term growth trajectory. In developed markets, increasing focus on early prevention drives patients to the dentist while they are young.", "As they grow older, they retain more of their natural teeth and demand more care to maintain them. In emerging economies, a growing middle class is paying more attention to oral health which is driving the need for more dental care. A significant part of our market is private pay. Short-term consumer behavior can impact patient visits or product mix for a quarter or two, but dental care is rarely postpone long. And we do not face the uncertainty associated with other healthcare reimbursement systems. Looking specifically at Dentsply Sirona, we are a stronger company today than when we began last year together. Coupling technology and consumables is creating a significant growth opportunity in this attractive market. As Dentsply Sirona, we created a special sales force to select consumables to go along with our leading installed base of equipment. This is a rapidly growing multi $100 million market. In the lab market, we have incorporated an integrated approach to our lab customers in the U.S. and Germany.", "As the only company to offer best-in-class equipment and consumables, we are seeing strong growth in these markets. As we roll out this same approach around the globe, we are confident that our lab business will accelerate. We have also implemented unique commercial programs to leverage our broad product portfolio. No other competitor has the leading brands and innovation to offer our value proposition. These programs remain relatively small, but are gaining momentum. As we expand these programs, you will begin to see the impact on sales growth. We expect to see some of these benefits in 2017. As the innovator in the industry, new products will fuel growth. In March, we will unveil a record number of new products and solutions at the International Dental Show in Cologne.", "These products are helping to shape the future of dentistry and will drive growth in 2017 and beyond. One of the key rationales for merging was to create end to end integrated solutions. At the IDS, we will highlight our unmatched ability to create better, safer and faster workflows. One of these products is our brand-new 3D Endo software. This software is the first and only of its kind, it was developed as a collaboration between our leading engineers, scientists and software developers in both Endodontics and digital radiography.", "The new software combines 3D x-ray data with an integrated file library to better analyze, plan and optimize root canals. This makes the endodontic treatments safer and more efficient and it can only be done with our leading Endodontic files. As we continue to introduce integrated solutions, we are also poised to benefit from the current megatrends in dentistry. Digital dentistry is being adopted rapidly.", "We are seeing significant growth in the digital impression business as well. And, for those not ready to go digital, we have a leading solutions for physical impression, including the new AQUASIL ULTRA plus which is growing rapidly, 3D imaging is growing double-digit around the globe. Awareness about single visit dentistry is driving demand for CEREC. Market penetration continues to increase around the world. In the U.S., adoption is accelerating and 17% of dental offices now have CEREC.", "To ignite further adoption in the U.S. market, we are expanding our go-to-market approach in the U.S. This will drive faster growth and make CEREC the standard of care. Our North American strategy will drive strong growth in the back half of 2017 and into 2018 and beyond. Top-line growth reminds at the forefront of our priorities and strategy, but we will also remain committed to driving leverage through our P&L and driving increased profitability.", "We anticipate earnings growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. And finally, capital allocation is a key component of our strategy. We intend to be a major consolidator in the dental industry. With our strong balance sheet, we remain focused on our pipeline of deals and a disciplined approach. We set high hurdle rates and expect strong returns.", "In addition to acquisitions, we intend to consistently return capital to shareholders. In 2016, we repurchased more shares than in any other year, and this morning, we announced that we have increased our dividend. We are pleased with our organization's accomplishments to-date and are following through on our plans for 2017.", "As we know, there is more work to be done. This organization is built for growth and our expectations are to grow faster than market. We are committed to leveraging our infrastructure to expand our operating margins. Our future is bright. With the innovations we can offer today and our ideas for treating patients in the future, we are enabling dental professionals to improve, change and save lives. I\u2019m confident about what we can achieve together. I like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for Dentsply Sirona.", "We are pleased to recognize our distribution partners for their loyal support and I would also like to extend a special thanks to our 15,000 employees who daily show their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients. Together, we will change dentistry for the better. We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Steven Valiquette", "Hi, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Congrats on the results.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Thank you.", "Steven Valiquette", "All of the color on the destocking is helpful for Q4 and pan to early 2017, so thanks for that. As we get further in the year, should we think about, could there be any restocking with other distributors as the year goes on? And just curious then if we should expect any further updates on the go-to-market strategy over and above what you talked about today or beyond the exclusivity with the other distributor in North America. Thanks.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Thanks, Steve, for the question. In putting together our guidance, we certainly took into consideration a lot of factors and one of those factors was, some stocking from other dealers in the future, but we don't want to get into the specifics of that now. And of course, we have de-risked the guidance as well, we certainly have another \u2013 a number of options that we are able to follow and that\u2019s why we highlighted the fact that we are redefining our go-to-market, as you know, we have an extraordinary portfolio of products.", "And there are various parts of the market that we can go to differently. And that\u2019s what we have thought about as we think about the second half of the year, but you have to keep in mind that we have an exclusive with Patterson, through September, we want to make sure everybody is focused on selling and as it makes sense, we will get into more detail about our go-to-market strategy.", "Steven Valiquette", "Okay, great. And then just very quickly, is there any update you can offer today on the ClearAligner strategy and is that evolving after for 2017 and beyond? Thanks.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Sure. Absolutely, in a second I will pass this on to Chris, but one of the reasons that we are so excited about being together, is the \u2013 where digital dentistry is going and the ortho franchise which once again grew faster than market. And I am excited to see where our manufacturing is going, and what we are able to do on the digital side. This will take time, but I think this is a big opportunity for us, we see ClearAligners again continuing to be a growth area and one that Dentsply Sirona should play an important role in.", "Chris Clark", "Yes, Steve. I can also add the ClearAligner business or the digital orthodontics more broadly as Jeff mentioned is a key focus area for us both in the near-term and also over time. I would say that the entry we have today in terms of MTM is growing nicely. We are well into double-digit case growth. And that\u2019s continuing I mean well in \u2013 and that\u2019s continuing very nicely both in the U.S. as well as in Europe. We recently received a 510(k) that expands the range of indications basically for that treatment. And that expands the percentage of cases that we can address with our MTM solution. So we are excited about the progress really with the platform we have with MTM. And we obviously are focusing in terms of broadening that platform and adding to that in terms of digital orthodontics as we move forward.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Jon Block with Stifel.", "Jon Block", "Hey, thanks, good morning, I will ask both upfront. Maybe first, Jeff, just thoughts on the traction in rest of world and Europe, which both seem solid, so maybe any color on international markets that are improving and then even are still challenging as we enter 2017. And then second question, Uli, I think, is for you. Just any more color on the bridge regarding 2017 EPS guidance? You gave some very good color on the revenue, but just in other words, on the EPS side of things as we think about the Patterson destock and how extreme that might be on EPS in the first half of 2017. Thanks, guys.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "I think what I would like to do is, Uli why don't you start and then I will talk about what we have been able to do and how I see the outlook for the international market.", "Uli Michel", "Okay, thanks for the question, Jon. I think the best way to think about it is we have done $2.78 this year, we are guiding to a range of $2.80 to $2.90 for arguments sake now let's take the midpoint $2.85, right, we told you that we expect a FX headwind of about $0.08 to $0.10 let\u2019s take $0.08 for the moment. I think you are also aware of this technical matter of the share count. We issued the shares at the end of February. So we consolidated one very strong month of Sirona at the time March. And we only had a share count of $178 million in the first quarter of 2016 and the full year share count of 222 we are leaving the year with the share count of $234 million.", "So we do still anticipate a buyback as we go into next year, we have modeled let\u2019s say buybacks in the tune of $50 million to $100 million per quarter. But that still leaves us with a share count for 2017 in the range of let's say 231 to 233 let's also take the midpoint 232 so that gives you $0.15 headwind from the share count itself.", "Now on the other side, we will consolidate two months of Sirona which we did not last year, that should also be about $0.08 \u2013 $0.07, $0.08 so that basically offsets the FX headwind. So in combination, I would say call it technical headwinds $0.15 you add this to the midpoint of our guidance of the $2.85 you are at $3 a share, and we do this with 5% constant currency growth, it represents about an 8% growth on EPS started with a 5% top line growth. So that\u2019s not too bad, but it is of course heavily impacted by destock reduction in the U.S. right.", "The inventories that are being brought down is CAD/CAM and imaging, they are fairly high-margin products, it represents, as we said next year about $50 million. It really doesn't impact our operating expense at all, frankly speaking. If we sell 1% more or less of CAD/CAM products overall, it doesn\u2019t really impact our operating expense.", "So, it drops through at the margin let's say it is about 60% margin on average that gives you about $0.10 of headwind from the inventory reduction. So if you add this back with this $0.12, $0.10 you would be at $3.10 which then would be about a 12% EPS growth with a 6% top line growth and this is kind of I would say the operational set up of the business.", "And then, a few things to keep in mind even with all of this, we are still funding significantly initiatives in 2017 that will benefit us for many years to come. We are setting up for a tremendous IDS show. We are investing money in IDS. We are doing a world tour in implants, which we haven't done for many years. We are setting up a new market platform. So all of this is being funded, we are investing money in new products or keep investing we want to keep the pipeline strong on R&D and product development.", "And then we are overcoming a few other what I would call technical headwinds, for example with the termination of the exclusivity, we lose also the amortization because we have set it up as a deferred revenue that ends in September but that costs us about $3 million year-over-year and there\u2019s a few other things which together are about $6 million of other pure technical headwinds or nonrecurring whenever there\u2019s another $0.02. So I think this gives you a bit of a flavor of the makeup of the EPS growth. I hope it helps.", "Jon Block", "It really does help. And very, very helpful. And, Jeff\u2026", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Absolutely, internationally, I think we posted a quality quarter, Europe up 5.1%, both consumable and technologies showed growth, both Southern and Northern Europe showed growth. Of course Southern Europe led the way, which was nice to see, albeit the base being lower, but of course Europe continues to be a mixed bag, we started to see some effects from Brexit uncertainty, France gave back some of the gains we had earlier in the year, really pleased to see improvement in Spain and Italy.", "And then as you think about in Germany held strong as well, as you think about and by the way, I would like to say that treatment centers had an extraordinary quarter for us this year, record. And as we think about CIS and Russia, we saw improvement, but of course this area continues to be challenged but we did extremely well. Again, seeing the benefits and the value of Dentsply Sirona, albeit from a lower base, rest of world as we told you would be the growth driver for the year did not disappoint, reaching 9.4%, almost double-digit, extremely pleased with what we saw in Asia and frankly, Japan drove growth, double-digit, which is impressive given the Japanese economy.", "Australia continues to be very solid for us. And China, and you have heard a lot in the news about the slowdown in China, also grew double-digits. I\u2019m pleased there and Brazil which has its own issues as a country continued to show growth for us and Latin America. So the Middle East challenged, we have talked about that. Political instability, and low oil prices continue to be an issue. But all in all, we had an excellent international quarter and I can tell you I believe rest of world will be growth driver again for us next year. And I look around at the regions, and I feel confident, as does the team that each region will grow next year for us.", "So, I feel we are well-positioned and it is one of the benefits of our geographic diversification in our portfolio. But keep in mind, that the first quarter, before an IDS will be challenged. But I'm sure we will be talking about this later in the call but the IDS is setting up for an exciting IDS for us.", "Chris Clark", "Maybe one other point to make on rest of world and Europe, it does show that our synergy projects work, we are a bit less restricted in what we can do in these areas and this has shown now in the fourth quarter the first benefits.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Absolutely, correct and an important point.", "Jon Block", "Great, thank you for the color guys.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan.", "Tycho Peterson", "Thanks. Jeff, do you brought up revenue synergies in your prepared comments, a couple of questions there is related to CEREC, would you think your share is on the consumables markets today and how much do you think you can pick up. And just can you maybe just touch on CAD/CAM competitive dynamics in general. And then my follow-up for Uli, just a quick one for Uli as a follow-up on the tax rate, it sounds like you think the slower rate is sustainable. Can you maybe just talk about the moving pieces there and obviously you are net importer so how do we think about reforming that context? Thanks.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "So great question, Tycho about the CEREC consumables, it\u2019s really amazing to look back at both organizations and recognize that we never played a significant role in a category which is hundreds of millions. And so we are still single-digits in this area, excited about what we are seeing from our installed base as well as our new users, the fact that we have dedicated a team to focus on this, which shows us that with the dental professional is interested in both our Celtra Duo and our zirconia and our platform of materials. But what\u2019s also important is to recognize as you think about it as the procedural sales, all of the other accessories that come along with it from the cement to the bonding and really the clinical education that helps support the dental professional.", "When you talk about CEREC, we have seen in the U.S. as reach about 17% of offices having it. We feel we are close to a tipping point and with the sales force that we have in North America and by the way I was just with them, 1200 strong. And understanding how enabling technologies really supports the procedural sale, this is exciting for us. Now when we look at the landscape, I think an area that has started to pick up is digital impression. And I would tell you that we are certainly don't feel as though we are getting our fair share there. I think that as a credit to the ortho market, which I believe has reached a tipping point. But there is no question, the 30 years that we have together, the CEREC is the gold-standard in restorative as we come together with our ortho business, we are able to add more value on that proposition. The clinical data, no product has been written about more about it. We have been pushing ourselves hard for the ease-of-use of our software including the speed and accuracy.", "And I think you also have to keep in mind, service and support and training make all the difference in the world. I\u2019m in my 18th year in dental and I certainly could show you, Tycho, some of the scars on my back with technology and to be here as Dentsply Sirona in this particular category, I think we are so well positioned for the future and there is more opportunities. There is more that CEREC can do combining with Endo and implant as we move forward.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. Thanks, and then Uli on taxes?", "Uli Michel", "Yes, we are guiding to a 20% tax rate, this improvement versus the 20.8% we have for 2016, is purely based on the extended benefits of combining these two companies. It does not take into account any tax changes and I will get to this for a moment, I should probably point out to you, many of you are aware that the accounting rules for the tax effects of share-based compensation has changed. And I think a number of companies have reported or guided to benefits from this respect. The first thing I want to point out, economically, nothing has changed, the text treatment of share-based compensation is not changed, just the accounting for it.", "And we discussed with our auditors, there is a formidable discussion amongst the accounting profession, whether that should be discrete tax item i.e. it would not be part of our adjusted EPS, just to get number or not, we have taken the conservative view and said okay it is probably going to be discrete, so we\u2019ve not consider this in our rate. If this ends up being not a discrete item but they in the adjusted rate this should be a bit of tailwind to our rate. These things are hard to estimate because under these rules we take the deduction for the excess value of option when people exercise over the fair value that we had amortized based on the black Charlotte [ph] at the time it was granted when people exercise. So it\u2019s hard to predict when somebody will exercise. So it will give more volatility to the rate.", "But, if this comes it is an upside to our rate, okay so much for existing legislation. Now, a word to the new legislation. We had a long meeting with our tax advisors about 10 days ago. And we went through the whole legislative landscape and looked at our situation and how it could impact us. But frankly speaking, this situation is still very much in flux and evolving. I think, so far, neither the Trump administration nor the Senate Republican leadership have put their weight behind the House blueprint. There is still the Ryan and the Camps proposal and other things out there. And I think it is really hard to predict what the legislative outcome will be at the end. I think if we look at the blueprint the way it is today and if that were enacted, we believe we would likely benefit from the lower rate, even though we are a net importer. However, there are many uncertainties, including how other jurisdictions may respond and so on.", "One thing I want to point out to you is that I think all the proposals debated include a change to a territorial system. Which, then, would make it as easy to repatriate foreign profits, as if it is for us today with our foreign tax credits. We have about $140 million of foreign tax credits, which enable us to today effectively repatriate our foreign earnings without additional tax, so this is of economic value for us today.", "If these proposals go through, it will become easier for everyone to repatriate and these foreign tax credits will in effect lose their economic benefit. This is the summary. I hope this helps a bit. I couldn't give you much more, Tycho, but it is a long speech, but I hope it helps. I like them to know we have been conservative in an area or two.", "Tycho Peterson", "Thanks, guys.", "Uli Michel", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I wonder if we could jump off on the conversation, Jeff, that you introduced about trends in the U.S. consumables market. Encouraging to hear that you saw some improvement and I believe you mentioned that you saw some of that in January as well. Could you just spend a minute on how you expect that segment of the market to evolve in 2017? And then I have a follow-up.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Yes, as you know, it has been a market that showed slow down and ebbs and flows, but certainly we see the market improving and we are encouraged with what we saw in December and frankly, into January on the retail side. So on the consumables side, our chairside consumables really strengthened throughout the quarter and, we feel, grew faster than market, which is certainly a good sign for what we are capable of doing and we would expect that to continue throughout 2017. As you think about that and what Uli mentioned about what we are also doing between the implant world tour, which will also be in the U.S., you also have DS world, which is shaping up with September in the back half of the year, as the market really improves, this will also help us accelerate our growth. We are built to be able to deal with that. So I think that is a very positive takeaway that we are seeing in the U.S.", "Chris Clark", "And certainly, we are going to be rolling out some exciting new products that the U.S. will benefit from at the IDS.", "Steve Beuchaw", "And then just a couple of clarification points. One is, following up on the question about inventory, is there any reason why on a 12, 24-month horizon that the net amount of inventory in the channel would remain lower than where we saw it, let's say, in October of 2016? And then, real quick, could we just get what price mix was for 2016? Thanks so much.", "Uli Michel", "Yes, go ahead.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "The inventory, we have said this will have a net impact that would be a headwind as more than 1% for us, but we have also said that we believe the back half of the year, we will accelerate. So, we have tried to put some of that into our assumptions and also take a de-risking of that, but we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. That\u2019s been built in to the guidance that we gave today.", "Uli Michel", "I think it is hard to predict what will happen beyond 2017. At the moment, we have given you our assumptions for 2017. The market we are serving with these inventories is about a $400 million revenue market for us, right? And we manufacture in Europe, we sell in the U.S., there is a six weeks lead time to bring the product here. I think, I don't want to predict what will happen beyond 2017.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "I mean, I would say that, beyond 2017, we should accelerate our growth. I mean, the adoption of our technologies is still strong. 3D seems to be the fastest-growing, our single-visit dentistry, CEREC, seems to get close to the tipping point. We are not getting our fair share on the DI side of this. Clearly we have a headwind with 2D and intraoral, which I have mentioned on a number of calls, looks to be at the mature and replacement point. But I would also say we are the innovator in the marketplace and we have got some exciting innovations that will carry us on for 2018 and beyond, which will be exciting to dental professionals.", "With regard to price, Steve, we raised prices in October, as usual. For equipment, there was a price rise in December, sorry, to start the year in January. But, equipment pricing has a lot more to do with new product introductions, and as I mentioned, this will be a record year for us at IDS in new products. So I am exciting to see that will have an impact on us in 2017 and beyond.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Thanks, guys.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And we will hear next from John Kreger with William Blair.", "John Kreger", "Hi, thanks. Jeff, just to clarify the last answer, I think in the past, your consumable price trend has been around 1.5%, 2%. Was that the price increase last October also?", "Uli Michel", "Yes, in the ballpark.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "At general range.", "John Kreger", "Okay, thank you. And Jeff, maybe now that the Patterson relationship has been updated, can you just step back and review the channel strategy in general? I know Dentsply and Sirona had pretty different strategies about how they go to market. Going forward, where will you go direct versus go through distribution or is that still in flux at this point?", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Yes, I think, appreciate that question, but we are redefining it. I mean, this is a area that, for example in Australia, we go direct with everything we do. In Japan, we go semi-direct. In the U.S., we have some of our product portfolio that goes direct, like endo, ortho and implant. And certainly, we have institutional sales and DSO sales that we go through a distribution for some and to the military direct. So, it is across the board. We were actually pretty aligned in this, but the whole point is we have had an extraordinary relationship with Patterson. What people seem to forget it is highly unusual to have 20-year exclusive on products and as I highlighted certainly with CEREC and Schick and then on everything for the Sirona in 2012.", "And keep in mind, we expect to continue to grow with Patterson and we have got a very strong and terrific relationship with Shine that is global in its nature. And I know both organizations, when they think about their strategy, they think about it with Dentsply Sirona. So we have got a lot to do, but I want to highlight the fact that, right now, we have an exclusive on our Sirona products in the U.S. with Patterson and the biggest focus that we need to do is we need to make sure that our organizations do our very best to sell during this period of time. And focus is critical, having the right resources to be able to address the needs of the dental practitioner is what we are most concerned about, and we will take care of how we go about redefining our strategy later in the year and we will obviously explain that in detail. But that is what we have taken into consideration when we gave guidance today.", "John Kreger", "Great, that is helpful. Thanks, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll hear next from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.", "Robert Jones", "Great. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to ask on the guidance, if I adjust for the channel inventory reduction, which you guys talked about in 2016, it looks like internal growth would have been about 3%. Your 2017 guidance at the midpoint, it seems that you are calling for a little bit of growth, but similar levels to 2017 in 2017 to 2016. I would have thought you'd seen an acceleration, given it is an IDS year and there should be some top-line synergies still. Are there any other headwinds that you would flag as I think about the year-over-year growth that you are guiding to?", "Uli Michel", "No, you should get to a larger growth than \u2013 I mean, there is also, there is more inventory reduction next year than this year, right? We had\u2026", "Robert Jones", "Right, but the internal growth number is 2.5% to 4.5%, right?", "Uli Michel", "To take the midpoint, 3.5%, and this is against another headwind of, let's say, $50 million of inventory reductions, so you are closer to 4%, right?", "Robert Jones", "Okay.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Even higher, yes, I was going to say.", "Uli Michel", "Yes.", "Robert Jones", "Okay. And then I guess just\u2026", "Jeffrey Slovin", "I mean, Bob, we are expecting to accelerate in 2017 over last year\u2019s growth.", "Robert Jones", "Jeff, is that what you mean when you made the comment about guidance being de-risked?", "Uli Michel", "No. He said the best view of what we have today of our business. We took all the pros and cons into consideration and what we gave you would not be qualified as being conservative. There is one area, which I pointed out to you on the tax rate, where we have assumed that this will be a discrete item, which you might consider conservative. The rest takes into account all the pros and cons. But of course, at the moment, we see the more challenging first half of the year and the second half of the year should really improve nicely.", "Robert Jones", "Yes, okay, got it. And then I guess on the margin line, this might be a similar answer with the inventory issue, but it does look like you were calling for flattish margins in 2017. I would have thought with the synergies, there would have been a little bit more expansion. Is that also as a result of having to kind of lap this inventory reduction issue?", "Uli Michel", "Now, on the margin side, I think what you see for the pro forma not pro forma for the 12 months of Dentsply and 10 months of SIRONA in 2017 is 21.8% operating margin. I think we pointed out on our Q1 call already that, that was favorably impacted by the fact that we only consolidated one month of Sirona, with very strong sales and stable operating expense.", "If you look at our numbers on a 12-month and 12-months basis, the operating margin this year would have been 21.4%. And what were guiding to shows improvement versus the 21.4% on a little bit of gliding scale depending on, how much we grow. But we\u2019d be closer to the probably 21.8% you have seen now, right for the 10 and 12 months.", "So operationally there is improvement in our operating margin in our guidance and this is still impacted heavily of course by the $50 million of sales we are forecasting or we are assuming we will lose in CAD/CAM and in imaging, it was again this $50 million more or less sales have no impact on our SG&A.", "Robert Jones", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. See you guys next week.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Thank you, Bob.", "Uli Michel", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And we will hear next from Matt Miksic with UBS.", "Vik Chopra", "Hey, good morning. This is Vik Chopra in for Matt Miksic. Thanks for taking the questions. So I had two questions. Maybe, one, we could talk about prioritization of your capital deployment strategy in terms of M&A, share repurchases, dividends. And the second question, I wanted to maybe shift gears to implant and maybe you could provide us with some color on your implant growth this quarter, expectations for 2017, and perhaps, geographically, whether it was stronger in the U.S. or the O-U.S. Thank you.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "And the second I will turn to Chris to talk about implant. We\u2019ve made this clear that part of our overall strategy is to be a consolidator. And I can tell you that the team is hard at work, we have got a nice pipeline that we are looking at. Where we feel that we can not only purchase a business, but also bring it into the Dentsply Sirona infrastructure, and then, accelerate the growth with it or take out margins and I think 2017 will certainly, will be focused on that as well. We have also said that we will continue to buy back our shares. We have a buyback in place.", "We believe in returning capital back to shareholders and this morning, we raised our dividend. So I think that is all part of it, if you think a little bit more specifically, into the acquisition side of it, we have so many great franchises that we can play a role in, that you know sometimes it is actually, you know, taking on a company that has struggled to get its technology to market as well, and we\u2019ve looked at that.", "But of course, when we do that, it is always about what we can do in-house as opposed to outside of the house, we have a tradition of taking smaller companies and making them bigger, so I think that hasn't changed and it is a big part about what we expect to do at Dentsply Sirona.", "Now implant is important because we made our big splash with MIS implant and really got us into the value segment, which is an exciting area, frankly one of the few areas that we didn\u2019t participate. $1.5 billion in size and growing faster than our overall growth so that is exciting, and that\u2019s accretive. And also when you couple that with our digital, an important role within our revenue synergies and bundling, and Uli has mentioned about the world tour, we are geared up for what we can do in implant and I would like to pass that to Chris.", "Chris Clark", "Sure. I appreciate that, Jeff and I would. Vik, I guess I would characterize the implant business. We were accelerating performance Q1 through Q3 sequentially, increasing momentum throughout most of the geographies. We did give a little bit of background back in Q4 but I would say certainly for the year we look at it and our growth is in line with market. We were ahead of market in Q3, so again we feel pretty solid in the context of the increasing momentum on this business, if you look at it from a geographic standpoint, we are strongest rest of world really led by far East China.", "In particular, Japan we are getting some nice momentum, both Uli and Jeff has mentioned the world summit tour as we speak, that\u2019s four different locations around the world. As we speak we\u2019ve got over 1000 dental professionals in Tokyo focused on understanding our latest innovations in terms of clinical implantology, on top of that a great opportunity for us to demonstrate the ties between our implants and the broader Dentsply Sirona portfolio including the digital portfolio.", "So we are very excited about that, there\u2019s a additional tour stops if you will later this year in the San Diego in May and Nice in June and Shanghai in November. So again there is al lot going on here, we are pleased with momentum, particularly improved momentum in the U.S. throughout the year. And again, I think that we\u2019re on our front foot as we enter 2017.", "Vik Chopra", "Thank you.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Thanks Vik.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Matthew O\u2019Brien with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I think you have talked about this a little bit, but the internal growth for 2017, despite the headwinds that you're going to see on the destocking, was quite good in our view. Can you just build up some of the assumptions, be it market improvement throughout 2017 in the U.S., the continued strength in Europe, rest of world, et cetera? Build us up to how you get to the, I think, you were saying when you exclude the impact of the destocking, something around 4.5% is the midpoint of the range. So just, again, building that up and how we should think about that.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "I mean there is two ways of doing it. One way is looking at what we think the dental market might grow and then build up to our growth, the other way is looking at what we have grown in 2016. I think that is probably for you guys the closer view, so if we take the growth we have 2.4% then there is the stocking so for arguments sake 2.93.", "We have benefits of synergies and market share gains in tune of may be 0.5% to 1% incremental to what we did in 2016 because we also had market share gains and synergies in 2016. Then we think there is a bid of market acceleration and GDP growth that includes the benefit of IDS. I would put this into the dental market growth. We probably benefit a bit more from this than others because we have a higher market share in the countries that are more impacted, Germany and the neighboring countries.", "So you could assume this gives us between 0.5% and 1.5% additional growth and then the inventory reduction, 0.5% to 1% on top of what was done in 2016 and if you do the math, you should be well within our range.", "Uli Michel", "Yes I would just make two comments again, look at what we\u2019re able to accomplish in rest of world and areas when we\u2019re able to really bring the power of the organization to our revenues synergies as a plus, the other thing that is in this guidance is an really nice balance of growth between consumables and technologies. As we taken to consideration the inventory reduction, and as we\u2019ve pointed out, we expect to grow faster in the back half of the year, and have some challenges, in the first half.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Fair enough. And then as the follow-up, on the gross margin side, it has been a metric that has been ticking lower. It is understandable. I am a little surprised it was lower in Q4, just given that there was the CEREC work done that we saw. Although I know the treatment centers was pretty strong, but how should we think about that metric maybe over the first half of this year and then into the back half? I mean, is it, are we getting to the point now where we are getting pretty close to a trough level on that metric and it should start to build back up or is there potential for further downside pressure?", "Jeffrey Slovin", "I think one of the things that you need to keep in mind, the intraoral business, which has been an important stalwart for Sirona it\u2019s slowing and it\u2019s one of our best gross profit margins as it is. Now, we will make up for that in other areas and one of the areas that we talked about that is very exciting for us, which we are starting to see some acceleration in the materials well you\u2019re getting the growth from that, that does not come with the same growth, gross profit margin for us. All in all, I think there is room to expand as we grow our business.", "Uli Michel", "Q4 probably had relatively speaking fairly low margins.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "All right thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll hear next from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.", "Brandon Couillard", "Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Just a two-part question for Uli. If we factor the inventory destocking effects, should we be thinking about core growth in the first half more like flattish? And then secondly, any directional commentary you can give us around the operating cash flow or free cash flow conversion expectations for the year?", "Uli Michel", "Now I think on the first question Brandon, I think we gave you a lot of hints on the calendarization and we don\u2019t want to get into the habits of giving quarterly guidance of building your quarterly models for you. So I think we gave enough hints on this. On cash flow, I mean we would expect a similar conversion than what we have seen this year. Some \u2013 I don\u2019t know, one of you always ask CapEx I forgot who it is so I\u2019ll say that \u2013 I will give you this number too, probably in the range of $120 million to $240 million next year.", "Brandon Couillard", "Great. Thanks.", "Uli Michel", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And we will hear next from Jason Bednar with Robert W. Baird.", "Jason Bednar", "Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Just a lot of my questions have been answered, here. But just wanted to come back to the improvements you saw in December and January. You mentioned a lot of those were on the chairside consumables side in the U.S. But it sounds like you did have some better growth on the orthodontic side as well. But to that extent as well to the endodontic side too were just wondering if you can maybe compare some of the specialty areas to the general areas for December/January.", "Chris Clark", "I would say Jason overall our specialty areas grew nicely. In the fourth quarter ortho again was we commented was above market or it continues to be above market that is a very competitive market. With declining sale prices and again, we are really pleased with the traction and increased, unit volume we are getting with that, I commented earlier on implants, relative to Endo. Endo was particularly strong in Europe had a very, very nice quarter there. So as we got into the quarter in terms of the just comment in terms of the sell through on the consumable business again looked-looked solid again. Stronger as we got into the quarter, so again we had December and then into January. I think he commented as well, so again, overall I think some momentum and hopefully it gives you little bit of your color in terms of the three of the three specialties.", "Jason Bednar", "Yes, thanks, Chris. And, Jeff, just one more to come back to you. Just on IDS. Anything that you can give on what we can maybe expect from IDS? I know you don't like to use these calls as a form to preview new products, but just any color that you can provide or comments that you can give.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Yes, first of all I think I would invite the callers that are on this call to come, because it will really be the first time you get an opportunity to see Dentsply Sirona in its full force and what I mean by that, is you will be able to tangibly see how enabling technologies have an impact on procedural solutions. And how they come together and it will give the dental professional the opportunity to who has a long-standing relationship with one or the other to see the benefits of having their full portfolio come together. So I think that will be a big part of this. But we did talk about the fact that we are going to have 50 new products there and some really great surprises as well that I think we will have growth implications for years to come.", "That will again, show why Dentsply Sirona is so uniquely positioned to do certain innovations that no one else can. And we have a saying that your next IDS needs to be your best IDS and I think this will not disappoint, we highlighted 3D Endo on the call because that is a clear differentiator, but we are going to have a number of them, and I think we are also going to show the overall dental market that if you thought you knew Dentsply Sirona think again. We\u2019ve got a lot in store.", "Jason Bednar", "Okay, great. Thanks Jeff. That\u2019s great.", "Operator", "And our final question will come from David Shoten with Great Lakes Review.", "David Shoten", "All right, thanks for taking the question and I was just wondering about the savings and if you could give any detail or quantify what you seeing as you look at the payout to start hitting this year and over the next year.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "I am sorry, David you will have to repeat yourself it faded in and out.", "David Shoten", "Sorry, I was asking about the procurement savings and how do you see that playing out over this year and the next year and, if you can, quantify it at all?", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Yes, I think procurement is a very important part of our cost savings, we are not going to go into the detail but that plays a role throughout our P&L on the gross profit side as well as the operating expenses and this is something that we\u2019ll continually improve on and in important parts of our cost reduction synergies.", "David Shoten", "All right. Thank you.", "Uli Michel", "Part of what helps fund all the investments we are making I told you about before.", "David Shoten", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations for closing remarks.", "Derek Leckow", "Well, thank you all for very much for joining us today.

I have some opening comments and then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim for some operational review and Chris will cover the financial results in more detail, and of course we\u2019ll take your questions following our prepared remarks.", "We\u2019re off to a reasonable start to the year with revenue growth picking up nicely in the U.S. in the first quarter and adjusted EPS flat with the prior year. Results were slightly better than expected on earnings driven by growth in the U.S. and 100 basis point improvement in operating margins. While growth in Europe was muted and FX rates deteriorated in the quarter after we last spoke to you in February.", "On markets we saw good increase in activity and demand in the U.S. as expected, consistent with the growth in employment over the past year. And at this point we would expect that to continue. Europe on the other hand was more mixed. Overall I\u2019d say it\u2019s stable but differed substantially by country, some up and some down during the period. This is a bit weaker than we expected going into the quarter. And rest of world markets as always were mixed but most were growing nicely with the exception of Japan, which as you know had a VAT tax increase April 1 last year which created some pull forward into the first quarter of last year and a difficult baseline for the first quarter this year. And of course that will reverse in the second quarter.", "At DENTSPLY our strategy remains the same which is to focus on innovation to fund future growth while leaning out the organization, improving margins and asset utilizations and ROIC. And channeling funds to some key areas that can increase our impact on the market over the next several years. Jim and Chris will have more on that in a moment.", "Looking at the first quarter, our revenue excluding precious metals declined by 8.4% for the quarter with constant currency and internal growth of positive 1.3%, while currency of course was negative 9.7%. Internal growth was comprised of 4.5% growth in the US, a negative 1.2% in Europe and CIS and a positive 1.9% growth for the rest of world category. The U.S. growth rate was notably stronger than we\u2019ve seen for some time, this was the best we\u2019ve had in seven quarters and was driven by growth in essentially all principal product categories.", "Results for some of the key dental shows in the U.S. earlier in the year were very positive and reflected both a market that\u2019s growing in demand and also good interest in our portfolio. We\u2019re also pleased with our sales force execution in the US, both the direct businesses and those that go through our key distributor partners, and we view this as an area or an opportunity for reinvestment moving forward.", "In Europe we saw a sequential slow down from the stronger growth we reported in the back half of last year. This market continues to be somewhat muted and it\u2019s inconsistent across country markets. This quarter we saw lower growth in several markets including a continued decline in the CIS region. We\u2019re not reading too much into that at this point as overall I\u2019d say the region appears stable to us, and we expect to see some small up and down periods before this market starts to grow consistently again. Certainly the weaker currency and the stimulus now in place in Europe we think gives us a reasonable chance that this market will pick up over the next year or so.", "The biannual IDS trade show was held in March in Cologne which was well attended as always. We saw strong interest in our products, although this tends to be more of an equipment driven show than a consumable show. Our results in Europe also reflect our transitional activities impacting our lab business. As we\u2019ve announced we are exiting certain equipment categories there that\u2019s causing a temporary drag on results of sales of those product that are still in the baseline from prior year. Europe ex lab was essentially flat for us in the first quarter.", "In rest of world we had 1.9% internal growth in total and roughly 5% internal growth without Japan where the VAT tax increase of course is distorting things for a couple quarters here. We continue to enjoy strong growth in the Pacific Rim. Growth recovered substantially for us in Latin America, Canada was strong, while Australia and the Middle East were kind of flattish and Japan was negative as expected due to the tax. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was flat with last year at $0.59. This reflects of course a currency headwind we\u2019re facing which is quite substantial offset by improved margins and a slightly lower share count.", "Looking ahead at current rates, we continue to have -- we continue to expect that we\u2019ll have the currency headwind for the balance of the year at this point. But of course we\u2019re focused on what we can do with our own operating model where we can improve our efficiency as well as invest for faster growth. That being said, we\u2019re comfortable with our current guidance of $2.50 to $2.60 adjusted earnings per share for the full year. That concludes my prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Jim Mosch who has some comments on operations.", "Jim Mosch", "Thank you, Bret. I\u2019d like to provide an operational update for Q1 and also provide some further perspectives on 2015 initiatives. I\u2019ll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review.", "As outlined in February, we were looking forward to the International Dental Show in Cologne, Germany. While the IDS tends to focus on large equipment, it is also an important show for the introduction of new products in the consumables area, and I\u2019d like to outline some of our key launches. Our endodontic business launch WaveOne GOLD, which is an extension of our market-leading WaveOne reciprocating file system. WaveOne GOLD utilizes a patented heat treatment process which improves file flexibility to negotiate difficult canal anatomy and also increase the safety due to higher resistance of cyclical fatigue.", "A second launch, a new cordless motor platform under the brand names X-Smart iQ and VDW. CONNECT Drive has the ability to operate in both reciprocating and rotary modes. The new motor is connected to an iPad with an app-based interface that will provide an extensive and customizable filed library as well as a patient education module. The platform is expandable, and in the future will incorporate apex locator capabilities as well as treatment planning.", "The restorative business continues their focus on procedural solutions to simplify restorative dentistry while providing effective patient results. This included a series of our market-leading products in combination to effectively complete a class 2 restoration which is the highest volume restorative dental procedure. The same philosophy is also applied to a crown and bridge solution as it relates to preparation and final placement of the prosthetic treatment. The procedure focus has also been extended to post endodontic treatment restorations, which we refer to as [RestoDonics]. This employs the use of our market-leading endodontic portfolio Palodent Plus Matrix system and our bulk-fill composite SDR.", "Our preventive business launch NUPRO White Varnish which has been successful the U.S. market for over a year, but this was its initial launch into the European market. This IDS was the most comprehensive presentation of our preventive portfolio in the European market and we believe there are significant opportunities for geographic expansion and growth. The prosthetic business presented their refocus to innovative all ceramic materials to be utilized in open platform digital systems. This was led by the launch of Cercon ht available in 16 vita shades as well as a special staining concept that supports small and medium-size labs. In addition there was a re-emphasis of our CELTRA Duo, which is our chair side high-strength glass ceramic material targeted at the fast-growing all ceramic category. Most significant was that the prosthetics business presented a consolidated product platform that will be marketed and leveraged on a global basis versus more region specific brands. Overall IDS attendance was up and we are pleased with the interest in our new product portfolio.", "Turning to operations, I\u2019d like to outline the status of our initiatives to achieve a 20% operating margin by the end of 2017. As outlined previously, our European prosthetics group is engaging in restructuring discussions with our German Works Council. This has resulted in the agreement to close one of the smaller facilities and the remaining restructuring is progressing. This effort is in alignment with the three manufacturing facilities and several field offices consolidated in 2014 and our focus to simplify our business model and leverage our asset base.", "As we further address operating margin improvement, we have been refocusing and restructuring our global business model. This has resulted in the formation of three segments. Manufacturing businesses that primarily sell through our distribution partners, which reflect our dental consumables, endodontic and dental laboratory businesses. Second, manufacturing business that sell direct to clinicians our patients which reflect our healthcare orthodontic and implant business. And finally, regional commercial organizations composed of our country selling stations in select developed and emerging markets.", "Within the manufacturing segments we will focus on global product platforms by clinical discipline and create consolidated functional organization. While this provides the opportunity to better leverage our asset base, more importantly it moves us from regionally focused businesses to global business strategies that we believe will drive long-term growth. In the regional commercial segment we are moving from independent businesses in country to fully integrated country organizations. This structure allows us to leverage common commercial, clinical and customer strategies. As we move forward through this strategic initiative, there\u2019s an amount of short-term distraction. However, this effort is necessary in order to achieve our operating improvement objectives and position our businesses more effectively to drive growth.", "Closely aligned with our operating improvement objectives is a requirement for investments. As we look to growth, they fall in the categories of innovation, clinical education and sales excellence. Our investments in these areas focus us on expansion of R&D and investment in larger and no doubt riskier innovation projects but with higher returns.", "In the area of clinical education we believe that we educate more clinicians than any other company in the dental industry. And we have implemented a DENTSPLY 360 program which leverages our clinical education programs across our businesses and clinical disciplines and delivers comprehensive clinical support and product utilization to clinicians. This has been particularly effective with group practices and institutions.", "Finally, sales excellence seeks to support the largest employee population in DENTSPLY which is our field sales representatives. We have invested in sophisticated tools as it relates to sales force alignment, deployment and sales analytics, which have improved sales effectiveness and execution. In addition to investing in sales representatives, we\u2019re also investing in global sales training development to ensure consistent sales capacity and competency on a global basis. We believe that the initiatives of strategic alignment, operating improvement and reinvestment will deliver long-term growth and results.", "I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Chris Clark to review the financial results.", "Chris Clark", "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to provide some detail on our first-quarter results by reviewing key elements of our income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. As well as provide -- be providing some additional color on capital deployment and highlight some of the few key related initiatives.", "For the first quarter, sales excluding precious metals declined 8.4% compared to prior year as internal growth of 130 basis points was more than fully offset by unfavorable currency translation of 970 basis points. The negative impact from currency on the top line with a bit larger than what we anticipated earlier in the quarter as the U.S. dollar sequentially strengthened against most currencies as the quarter progressed, including a 2% strengthening against the euro on average from the rate we assumed at the time of our February earnings call.", "Given the recent pullback of the dollar over the last week, based on current rates, the currency translation impact on our sales line for the full year is in line with the negative 800 basis points and we indicated on our call in February. Net acquisition growth in the quarter was negligible as we completed a small acquisition in Q4 but also had three divestitures over the last year that offset it from a sales perspective. Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the first quarter was 59.8% of sales excluding precious metals, which was an improvement of 200 basis points over prior year. This reflects the favorable impact of mix, FX and price.", "SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were down 5.9% in the absolute reflecting the currency translation impact. As a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals, SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 41.2% in the quarter, that\u2019s up 110 basis points compared to our rate in the first quarter of 2014. And this reflects incremental trade show costs, largely those associated with the biannual International Dental Show, as well as increased professional services costs including spending to support our global operating margin improvement initiatives. Collectively these two areas contributed approximately 100 basis points to the quarter\u2019s increased SG&A rate.", "Operating margin for the quarter improved by 100 basis points to 18.7% of sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis, and this compares to 17.7% in the first quarter last year. This is on top of the 150 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. Our performance this quarter reflects the gross margin and SG&A impacts that I just described as well as the impact of our operating margin improvement initiatives.", "One area where we are continuing to gain momentum is our global procurement initiatives were we are focused on gaining the purchasing leverage from the collective spend across our global businesses as opposed to approaching the market as individual companies or divisions. This is an area where we\u2019ve invested considerably over the past year, adding both internal and external resources. We\u2019re pleased with the progress of our global team as targeted initiatives in the number of areas are delivering benefits including travel, office supplies, packaging, specific raw material components, temporary labor, OEM supply and others.", "Our reported tax rate for the first quarter was 21.6% while our adjusted operating tax rate was 22.9%, which was 30 basis points above our first-quarter rate last year. We anticipated continued headwind in the adjusted operating tax rate as a result of our projected unfavorable geographic earnings mix in 2015 compared to prior year.", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as reported basis in the first quarter was $64 million or $0.45 per diluted share, and this compares to $72.9 million or $0.50 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2014. These results include a number of items which we\u2019ve listed in the schedules in the release. On an adjusted basis, net earnings $3.6 million in the quarter compared to $85.5 million in the prior-year quarter.", "Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.59 equal to last year\u2019s first quarter including the headwinds from currency and IDS that I outlined earlier. [Currency] represented a headwind to earnings in the quarter of approximately $0.035 per share, and this was a bit worse than what we anticipated coming into the quarter. This reflects the incremental strengthening dollar during the quarter that I mentioned earlier.", "Moving on to cash flow, our operating cash flow for the quarter with $65.6 million and that\u2019s up 2% from last year\u2019s previous first-quarter record of $64.6 million, and is up 82% from $36.1 million in the first quarter of 2013. This was the fifth straight quarter with record cash flow for that calendar quarter.", "Free cash flow for the quarter increased over prior year by $10 million, or 26%, and we continue to be pleased with our cash flow performance as our trailing 12-month operating cash flow was up 25% versus the previous 12 months ended March 2014. In addition, our free cash flow conversion ratio over that period is 150% of reported GAAP net income while our free cash flow yield is 6.6%. Inventories finished 118 days in March, that\u2019s up five days sequentially and down two days from prior year. We typically see a bit of an increase in inventory early in the year based on normal seasonal factors. We anticipate continued year-on-year improvements in the inventory levels moving forward and our Management teams have specific targets relative to inventories and working capital.", "Accounts receivables were at 58 days in March, that\u2019s up three days from December and down three days from 61 days last March. Capital expenditures were $16 million in the quarter while depreciation was $19 million and amortization was $11 million.", "We\u2019ve commented previously on the positive position our cash flow performance puts us in relative to capital deployment flexibility, and our first quarter demonstrates some of these benefits. During the quarter we repurchased 1.7 million shares of stock at an average cost of $52.08 per share.", "In the quarter we returned $80 million to shareholders through share buybacks, net of option proceeds and dividends. Our leverage ratio defined as net debt divided by trailing 12 months EBITDA now stands at 2.1 at the end of March.", "Looking forward, our balance sheet and cash flow generation continue to provide us considerable flexibility to deploy capital through acquisition and share buybacks. As we look to the remainder of 2015, on the solid underlying operating margin and cash flow performance for the business in the first quarter and we\u2019re confident our initiatives to improve efficiencies are gaining traction. We commented on our call in February that the year-on-year comparisons would be significantly impacted by the much stronger U.S. dollar compared to 2014. And as I mentioned, due to rate changes within the quarter, the headwinds we experience in the first quarter were a bit larger than anticipated both on the top and bottom lines.", "Rates have come back to us a bit with the weakening of the U.S. dollar over the past week. And based on current rates we would project the full-year currency headwind to earnings to be about $0.14 per share net of our cash flow hedges, and that\u2019s consistent with what we indicated on our call in February.", "As you may recall, these hedges helped to partially blend our FX impact over a rolling 18-month period. And while they don\u2019t eliminate or reduce the long-term impact of currency changes, they do reduce the volatility by essentially gradualizing those rate changes. Absent the cash flow hedges, the negative impact to earnings per share from currency would be approximately double the $0.14 that I just mentioned.", "As I mentioned in February, one of the longer term benefits of our operating margin improvement initiative is to standardize production processes across similar facilities which should allow us over time to flex a portion of our production between plants or geographies based on a range of factors including currency movements. We also have worked to offset a portion of the currency headwind through targeted pricing and cost initiatives in the short term.", "As Jim mentioned as part of our operating improvement initiative, we are aligning our businesses based on business type, manufacturing businesses that sell predominately through distribution, manufacturing businesses that sell -- that primarily sell directly to end users and finally geographic selling locations. And you will see that our segment reporting in our first quarter Form 10-Q and subsequent filings will reflect this alignment.", "Finally as Bret indicated, we\u2019re maintaining our 2015 earnings per share guidance at $2.50 to $2.60 on an adjusted basis. That completes our prepared remarks, we certainly appreciate your support and we\u2019d be glad now to take any questions that you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Glen Santangelo, Credit Suisse.", "Glen Santangelo", "Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the revenue growth numbers. I think the problems in Europe to be pretty well documented the can you just comment on the rest of the world category in terms of what you\u2019re seeing there because it seems like the growth has obviously decelerated a little bit, and I think everyone is we\u2019re the issues in Japan and the tax issue but maybe above and beyond that could you maybe just give us some commentary in terms of the outlook in some of the key markets there?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Sure. I would like to remind everybody that are rest of world category includes a mix of emerging markets and developed markets. So for instance, Japan, Canada and Australia are included in that category. Those markets are acting like developed markets at this point. The Canadian market is going pretty nicely for us. I think that\u2019s there some type to the United States they are not a direct tie but we see the outlook they are being favorable at this point.", "The Australian market is flat. I think that\u2019s consistent with some of the economic growth the issues they have. There were some articles recently about perhaps they need to cut interest rates there. The currency is already quite week, and that raises of course the cost of doing business and Australia because it\u2019s an important economy for product like ours.", "So I don\u2019t see a substantial uptick there one way or another. Japan is United act like a developed market a contract in the first quarter of the goodwill expanding the second quarter maybe when the third quarter because the low baseline, but long-term Japan is a low growth stable market. The rest of world category for us is of course emerging markets. We continue to see good growth and expect to see good growth in the Pacific Rim including China which is continues to be a robust market. But also some of the other countries in that category as well. Latin America has been hot and cold. And I grown pretty consistently for us kind of coming up to the second quarter last year when the World Cup was in Brazil, but then had a couple of slow quarters the growth this period recovered.", "Our hope is that is now on a more stable basis and will continue to grow maybe not as fast as it was two or three years ago but growth on a more stable basis going forward. The currency there is a big factor as well because of the depreciation of the real. So it\u2019s hard to describe rest of world at one comment. It\u2019s a complex group of countries for us. But I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind it\u2019s a mix of both developed and developing markets.", "Glen Santangelo", "Thanks for the comment. Maybe just ask a follow-up question. It seems like on a more encouraging basis the margins and cash flows continue to improve and as the leverage comes down, can you maybe just give us some of your updated thoughts in terms of the capital deployment outlook? It seems like obviously the company bought back some stock this quarter, but maybe if you look at your M&A pipeline, how does that stack up versus the attractiveness of buyback your own stock and how should we think about that lacks.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Sure. First of all, I would reiterate what we\u2019ve said earlier, and that is that we are very focused on cash flow generation. You\u2019ve seen that come up in the company as well as with margins asset turns are improving. ROI has improved pretty substantially over the past three or four years. We think we\u2019re in a good position now to produce quite a bit of cash, and that will be -- the first priority for that of course is reinvesting in the company where we get a really good pay back on capital investment internally to grow both sales and earnings.", "Second priority continues to be acquisitions. We are looking in acquisitions. We do have several candidates in the pipeline. We\u2019re in active discussions with several companies. They are, of course, we are looking to get a reasonable return in ROIC over a period of time. As a top priority for external spend I expect that to continue to be a reasonable part of the balance on capital deployment.", "The third priority, of courses, returning cash to shareholders. What we\u2019ve said is that we are going to neutralize the equity program and then some. You\u2019ve seen us do that over the last several quarters. We\u2019ve brought the share count somewhat. And I would be surprised by the way to see some further deleveraging at some point. We don\u2019t have deleveraging is kind of in event driven at this point debt instruments which are but I would think of it in a couple of years you will see some further deleveraging as well. So that\u2019s kind of the order priorities at this point.", "Operator", "John Kreger, William Blair.", "John Kreger", "Bret, can you just talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in some of the key specialty markets? Are you seeing any left for example in the orthodontic market? And I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about the pricing pressure there, curious if you\u2019ve seen any change.", "Bret Wise", "Sure. First of all, specialty markets for us are comprised of endo, ortho, and implant. The endo market continues to perform quite well for us. That\u2019s a product that\u2019s sold primarily through distribution, but in a couple of select countries, sold direct. That\u2019s market also where we have brought out quite a bit of innovation, and we\u2019ve got a strong innovation pipeline going forward. So I expect that to continue to be a growth market for us. Implant is a bit of a mix bag. As I commented earlier, it\u2019s growing nicely in the U.S. It\u2019s not growing in Europe at this point. We\u2019ve got a new implant on the market that\u2019s gaining a lot of attention. We view that as an upside opportunity for us.", "The orthodontic market is one that is been in a state of change for the last couple of years. There\u2019s been a lot of price pressure in that market. There continues to be a reasonable amount of price pressure. We\u2019ve seen some improvement in select country markets over the last year or so. We might be reaching an inflection point I think in that market where it could improve for us. Right now, it\u2019s a pretty good market for us in the U.S., more of a mix market overseas.", "Jim, I don\u2019t know. Do you have anything to add on ontho?", "Jim Mosch", "Yes, from our standpoint what we\u2019ve seen in the ortho market overall is that case starts globally appear to be flat. And that would indicate that they are slightly negative in the U.S. and Europe and growing in the rest of the world. So the market overall is not significantly robust. As has been mentioned, the average sale price pressure that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years has continued. We were pleased we saw better performance in North America in the first quarter. So we are starting to see some movement. We\u2019re certainly being more aggressive in the marketplace, and we are looking to gain share.", "John Kreger", "That\u2019s helpful; thanks. And then, Jim, maybe if you could expand a little bit more in these new three reportable segments. What sort of operational changes are you making beyond just the different way that you are reporting them to us? And I think you mentioned some short-term distractions. Can you just elaborate on that?", "Jim Mosch", "Certainly. I guess what I would say, there\u2019s two key strategic elements here. One is to say that our ability to focus our businesses more globally. So we would have -- in the past we would have specific businesses within the endodontic area, for example. They certainly would have a global approach, and they would work on certainly, common programs R&D operational initiatives. But they also had really very much a geographic focus. And we would see that our groups were aligned in such a way that they would have focused on a given discipline in dentistry as well as geographic responsibilities. What we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve really streamlined that, and we\u2019ve sought to create segments of like businesses that focus on a given segment of customers.", "Within these businesses, we\u2019ve sought to streamline their management structure and also to make -- create a strategy of global product portfolios where as opposed to looking at more regionally focused brands, we truly look globally category by category and align our brands in that fashion. We think that this approach is going to certainly create some efficiencies, but also give us a much more effective approach, a more strategic approach to the global market.", "In our country organizations, I think the second thing that I mentioned was that we would look -- historically we had several different divisions operating within a country. We have sought to create really truly DENTSPLY country locations in which they all operate with a common strategy, they leverage resources, and they focus on common customers. And we believe that there are a lot of efficiencies and certainly effectiveness in the market associated with doing that. The distraction piece I would say, it really comes from the standpoint that as you create -- as you realign the business strategically, as you create these efficiencies in the market place, there are changes that are occurring. There are changes in roles and responsibilities and people. You tend to see some efficiencies initially in the form of synergies call you sort we have seen some of that in our result of some of the restructuring that we\u2019ve taken. But the longer-term effectiveness of the marketplace does take some time as people were new roles and new strategy.", "John Kreger", "Great, and then one last one. The U.S. growth was really strong. Curious if you think that type of growth is sustainable throughout the rest of the year.", "Chris Clark", "Well, I think we\u2019ve seen some pretty strong reports from our competitors and some of our distribution partners thus far about the U.S. market. Of course we\u2019ve said before that the U.S. market is driven primarily by job growth, in particular white-collar job growth. We\u2019ve seen some pretty good improvements in that over last several quarters, four or five quarters. And dentistry is a lagging indicator. So typically, we pick up a couple of quarters after the labor market picks up. So there\u2019s been some bumpy economic news in the last few weeks, but over the -- longer let\u2019s call it four or five quarters, it is been strong. And as long as that continues, I think you will continue to see U.S. dental market perform pretty well.", "Operator", "Robert Jones, Goldman Sachs.", "Nathan Rich", "Hi this is Nathan Rich on this quarter. Wanted to go back to the operating margin performance. Chris, you mentioned the number of moving pieces in your prepared remarks in terms of what drove the margin expansion. But just wanted to ask if you are able to give us a sense of how much the efficiency initiatives made contributed to operating margin in the quarter if you try to isolate that impact.", "Chris Clark", "Yes it contributed in the neighborhood of 4250 in terms of the improvements so we are getting a sizable help cover that. As I mentioned ideas and trade show cause obviously with the other way in the quarter. But again, overall we are seeing some nice lift, and you can look back historically at this type of internal sales growth level, we would struggle to get operating margin lifted at that sales level. So from that angle again I think we\u2019re pleased with the traction, and again, on a number of fronts including the purchasing procurement initiative as I mentioned. but again, I think we are making real solid progress.", "Nathan Rich", "Great. I think on last quarter\u2019s call, you guys had talked about initially expecting the first quarter to be the most challenging from a margin perspective, so just wanted to get your updated thoughts on margin progression for the rest of the year.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yes as we look to last year baseline we had a significant increase 13%, 40% in terms of earnings in the quarter. We knew we were coming up against that. We also -- as we look at FX, FX we anticipate maybe $0.14 for the year. Maybe a little less than fair share in the quarter was what we anticipated, came in pretty much in line with basically straight-line quarter. But we also knew we had the IDS cost. So from that angle, we thought that it was going to be a little bit more challenging, in terms of the earnings side. We\u2019re pleased, obviously, with the underlying performance. As we move forward, there\u2019s a number of factors still at play. I mean, we\u2019ve got -- I think that we are pleased and terms of the traction, as I mentioned, on the efficiency program. FX still remains a wild card. Certainly the U.S. growth is a - the healthcare and assuming that continues, that\u2019s helpful. Europe is a bit of a wild card as well. So again, I think we\u2019ve got some puts and takes, but as Bret mentioned, that\u2019s why we\u2019re comfortable with the range that we have.", "Operator", "Brandon Couillard, Jefferies.", "Brandon Couillard", "Bret, back on Europe, could you break out the growth [ex Russia in] CIS? And broadly, do you still think you\u2019re taking share in the broader European market?", "Bret Wise", "The growth ex CIS was still slightly negative for the quarter, and that was driven by lab. Without the lab, we would\u2019ve been -- the rest of the businesses in aggregate were going. I don\u2019t have a specific number with that, but it\u2019s -- it was one it was minus 1.2 with CIS so it would be...", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Zero point nine.", "Bret Wise", "Do I think we\u2019re taking share there? I think we are, although the data we get out of Europe is not as good as the data we get out the U.S. I have to kind of triangulate the reports from distributors as well as other direct businesses that report. And in total, I would say we are still a little bit better off than the competition in the European market. Again, we don\u2019t -- even though it slightly negative this quarter, we don\u2019t see that as a new trend. We think that that market\u2019s going to come back for a number of reasons, and we are quite positive on our ability to grow in that market over the next year or so.", "Brandon Couillard", "Thanks. You elaborated a little bit more on the some of the moves you\u2019ve taken recently terms of procedural selling efforts. Can you give us an update on exactly where you are terms of rolling out those types of programs? And is that something you think can be noticeably accretive to the top line?", "Jim Mosch", "This is Jim Mosch. Yes, we\u2019ve - our [restored] group has probably led the way in this area, probably followed by endodontic businesses. This procedural selling approach has been very, very well received. We rolled out the class 2 globally. We have started the crown and bridge procedure, and the [RestoDonics] primarily in Europe and U.S. at this point in time -- excuse me, crown and bridges is in Europe and U.S., and [RestoDonics] is in Europe. And we seek to create more these programs. They probably do a couple of different things for us. One is they group our products in a logical sense in the way clinicians use them and how they understand to be used. They also make it very understandable for our field organization as they represent a position these products. And so, we found it to be very, very effective in the marketplace. It also helps us -- which we talked about some of our strategic initiatives, it also helps us to build bridges between our various businesses products like endodontics and restoration, lab and restorative. So we see that we will continue to work on these procedural programs and roll them globally, and they are definitely having an impact. We see substantial growth in the products that are in these procedural selling programs.", "Operator", "Steven Valiquette, UBS.", "Steven Valiquette", "Thanks. Good morning. For my point of view, obviously I still think the U.S. growth was phenomenal acceleration. Somebody asked about a little more color there. I guess I have a few questions I to that as well. Just wanted to confirm, I\u2019m guessing that still overwhelmingly driven by volume increases or I\u2019m curious to know if there was any sort of price or mix component that was affecting that? And then also, I guess it was in crystal-clear, but just to clarify maybe just sort of how much implant growth may have drove some of that acceleration versus a basket of other products outside of implants?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Okay, Steve, I will take a shot at some of this, and Chris will probably fill in some of the blanks year as well. Implant growth did not influence the number one way or another significantly in the quarter. So it was a broad basket of improvement across many product categories that we had. I think that the growth in the U.S. is, in part, volume at this point. Price mix probably plays a role as well. I\u2019m going to ask Chris if he can - can you comment on?", "Chris Clark", "Yes, from a price standpoint, we think prices in line with what traditional price would be, typically in the 1.5 range, we believe in the U.S. year on year. And that\u2019s associated with the price increases we took last October.", "Operator", "Steve Beuchaw, Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of fine points. First for Chris, it\u2019s clearly a strong story here in terms of the free cash flow growth. But given how many moving parts there are, I wonder if you could speak to the sustainability of the free cash flow growth over the balance of the year? Or would you be willing to provide or update a figure on where you think cash flow -- free cash flow, rather, could come out for the full year?", "Chris Clark", "Yes, we don\u2019t guide on that specifically, but what I would say is that, again, we\u2019ve been helped over the last five, six quarters really with improvements in networking capital. We have a strong focus there. But sometimes that\u2019s an actual improvement sequentially in terms of working capital coming down, and in some cases, like in the first quarter, it actually came up a little bit as we had some seasonality typically where we do bring inventories up a little bit in the first quarter and the first half of the year, and then they come down - tend to come down in the second half of the year. But they did not increase much as they did in the prior year.", "So again, we have a very strong focus on networking capital. All of our business leaders have specific targets and objectives based on these. It\u2019s an element of the senior executive compensation plan as well. So again, I think that that\u2019s certainly driving focus, and I would anticipate that continuing to help. I would say the reason why it may not be 100% sequential as we think about structural changes or anything in terms of changing any operational specifically regarding facilities, we would typically build some inventory -- transitional inventory in between. So you may see from time to time over the next several years some transitional inventory there and as well, obviously, again the underlying demand coming through. I would say from a CapEx perspective in the first quarter related to free cash flow, first quarter was [phasing wise] a little bit lower than what would expect. I would still guide neighborhood of $100 million for the year. But again, obviously as we look, we would anticipate continued improvements generally in terms of overall free cash flow over a longer period of time.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Much appreciated. And then a question on implants. I\u2019m not sure this is better for Bret or for Jim, but I wonder if you could talk about your experience over the last 12 months or so with EV on the market, specifically with regard to market share. Now that you have the product line out there, the sales force ramped up, maybe not in all regions, but in certain regions, how do you think about your competitive positioning relative to EV? Is this what you need to continue to hold a gain share in the market? And maybe this is more for Bret -- and how you thinking given that experience about the potential for broadening the bag in implants? Thanks.", "Jim Mosch", "I will handle the first question. The EV launch continues to go well. I think as we\u2019ve outlined in the past, I think the system was very much designed for clinicians. It offers a lot of simplicity and effectiveness in the implant procedure and really identifying, taking out steps, making it to be very easy to use system. As we referenced last year, the - we launched that later in a couple of major markets really being the U.S. and Germany. We really got going into Q3 of last year, and as a result, we expect to see continued growth in those regions.", "Conversion rates are very good. And I think as I referenced last time, we are seeing that are our EV conversion is up around 50% and growing rapidly. So we\u2019re pleased with how EV is positioned, and we believe that while we really efficiently launched this in March of last year, we think that the launch has a lot of legs left and that we are going to continue to see penetration throughout the rest of the year. I would also say that we continue to launch in the biomaterials area, which we did at IDS, we continue to expand our digital portfolio, which we also did at IDS with the new [simplant17], new 3D editor for Atlantis system, a new Atlantis platforms. So EV is a big part of the story, but it is also a portfolio approach that will move us forward.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I will comment on the broadening the bag question. Jim described that in the bag we have today, we have premium implants and basically all the support services that are needed to help a clinician be efficient in the implant placement. I assume by broadening the bag, you\u2019re talking about either mid range or value-priced implants versus a premium category. We continue to participate in the value range through our investment, minority investment in the South Korean implant company. We are monitoring that - the market in total closely. It has become a reasonably large market. As we evaluate companies in that category, we find a lot of that aren\u2019t making money. We find a few that are. So we\u2019re looking for the magic sauce there, and we have not decided to make a move in that category at this date.", "Operator", "Erin Wilson, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Erin Wilson", "Thanks for taking my questions. Sorry if I missed this, but at the distributor level was there any meaningful distributor inventory restocking, destocking, and in particular the U.S. as well?", "Chris Clark", "No, what we saw in - Erin, it\u2019s Chris. What we saw in the quarter was pretty consistent with what we saw in general in aggregate last year in the first quarter. So maybe some changes on an individual business plus or minus, but one exception to that obviously is Japan where again there is significant stocking in the prior year base.", "Erin Wilson", "Okay, great. And then given the strong cash flow characteristics year and you mentioned M&A is one that top priorities, but what is been the hold up on M&A activity? Or are valuations just egregiously high right now? Or is it just patients around finding the right asses? Or can you elaborate what you\u2019re seeing out there?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I think valuations are little bit frothy at this point. However, for the right asset, we would probably pay up. I think it\u2019s more finding the transactions which are executable now, fit our strategy, and also deliver the financial matrix that we want. I would say we\u2019re reasonably selective at this point. There have been some assets that come into market that we passed on, just because they didn\u2019t fit those criteria for us.", "Erin Wilson", "Okay. Great. And then after we think about contributions from the launches at IDS over the course of the year, should we expect this to be similar to previous years? Or is anything expedited or delayed, or anything like that would be helpful.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yes, Erin, I think when we look at the IDS, we tend to see maybe a little bit of a bump in the quarter after. But I would say generally the profile of launches - IDS seems to have an impact on Germany and Europe. Rest of world launches come later. We have a good portfolio of launches throughout the balance of the year, and I would expect that to be fairly consistent year on year.", "Operator", "Jeff Johnson, Robert Baird.", "Jeff Johnson", "Thank you good morning guys. Just wanted to check in one more question on the margin side. It looks like currency may be helped by about 50 basis points this quarter of the operating line. Chris, can you confirm that? And then if that\u2019s true, if margins are kind of being rebased 50 basis points higher or so due to currency, is there a chance that 20% guidance for 2017 has some upward bias to it? It looks like to me this year you\u2019re already going to be north of 19% with the currency help there. So it would seem to me there might be some upward bias of that 20% goal, but I would like to hear your opinion on that.", "Chris Clark", "Yes, Jeff, there is no doubt that currency is having an impact on the operating margin. I think that obviously we gave you the impact on the top line right now. That impact on the top line is larger than the impact on the bottom line. And that obviously, by definition, driving operating margin improvement if you will from FX. Some of that is -- a good chunk of that is becoming basically is resulted in cash flow hedges that, as we indicated, mitigate in the near term the full impact of FX coming through the PNL. So FX I would anticipate being a -- I think we commented on this in February -- being a tailwind, if you will, right now to the operating margin improvement. But turnaround -- if these rates stay where they, turnaround will be a headwind basically as the hedges basically expire and then are replaced of hedges at the same rate, which would not have any impact. So again, I think you\u2019re correct in terms of identifying FX certainly helping us right out. We called it out, but again, I think beyond that, the FX will swing around and be a hit to operating margin at some point if rates as they were they are.", "Jeff Johnson", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just too little modeling questions. Equity and affiliates looks like it was a bigger loss than we had seen really in your history. Can you walk us through maybe that and the net interest with a little higher as well. And I\u2019m assuming that has to do with hedging, but maybe any clarity there would be helpful for modeling purposes.", "Chris Clark", "Sure, so the equity piece comes from our estimate in the South Korean implant manufacturer. We have an ownership stake in that a minority stake as well as some convertible bonds with that. And so as such, as their stock price increases, the market value change in the convertible bond drops as the fair value of the liability of the bond increases on their books. So we then have to take basically our percent ownership of that drop, and that\u2019s what you see coming through. So we had a pretty significant ramp-up, if you will, in their stock price in the quarter, and as such when that happens than that the bigger loss coming through for us. And again, that\u2019s move from our non-GAAP results because of the fair market value adjustment. In terms of interest and other, several things going on there. In terms of the non-GAAP basis, basically which removes again the market-to-market impact. Basically net interest, we got help in terms of lower debt levels, but that\u2019s offset by lower interest income from derivatives.", "And again, what you see actually on a non-GAAP basis about $1 million year-on-year improvement combined between interest and other. And that\u2019s really mainly at this stage coming through the other income expense line, which is favorable pick up on FX gain and loss in the quarter.", "Operator", "And now we\u2019ll hear from John Block with Stifel.", "John Block", "Thanks, guys, good morning. Appreciate you taking the questions. First question on Europe, if I look at European growth [ex CIS], it seems like a step down from roughly 3.8% last quarter and 4Q, I think you mentioned -0.9% in 1Q 2015. It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s a comp issue, so just curious any additional thoughts on Europe. It does it feel like a pretty big step down? And again, one of your main competitors cited European weakness, but they seem to imply the weakness was maybe a little bit more temporary in nature. So can you just touch on what you\u2019re seeing there and our confidence on restaging growth in Europe this year despite the comps getting more difficult?", "Bret Wise", "Yes. I\u2019ll take a stab at this, and then Chris can comment if he is anything to add. We have seen the European market move around a quite a bit. It\u2019s not really one market. There\u2019s seven or eight key country markets in there. I would say for the last two quarters of \u201814, we saw a more consistent uptick across all those markets. In the first quarter we saw more of a mix. So we saw some slowing in several country markets, and we saw continued growth in several markets. As we talk to our people on the ground in those markets, they don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s a long-term negative trends. They think it is just the markets pausing for a bit, and they expect those recovering to improve as we move through this year. I don\u2019t have a lot more data than that other than the feedback we get from our people that are closest to the market. Chris, do you have anything to add to that?", "Chris Clark", "Yes, I might add - I think we said in last couple of quarters as well when asked about Europe that it was tough to tell how much was us and how much was market. And again, I think what we try to indicate you was that we weren\u2019t is confident that the underlying market was moving at that same rate is what we were. And again, I think that obviously in the fourth quarter - in the first quarter here we do believe the markets are a little bit more tempered in line with Bret\u2019s comments. The other piece I guess I would say for us there is no doubt that the changes we are making on the lab business are probably incrementally more of a distraction as we move through this. The distraction, if you will, certainly from an organizational perspective, but as well, I mean, we\u2019ve announced the discontinuation, the intended discontinuation of some product lines, and that\u2019s going to carry with it a headwind as well.", "So we\u2019ve got a few things I think a little bit more temporal terms of unique to us, particularly in the lab side, that probably are taking in a little bit factor right now. Obviously, we\u2019re doing the -- pursuing this action to improve that business moving forward, and we still confident in that trajectory.", "John Block", "Okay, great. And maybe just one more for me -- some other ones were previously answered. But you mentioned the implant strength in the U.S. and that was aided by EV. Any changes in the mix you\u2019re seeing in the industry between specialist and GPs? And obviously [stawmen], they\u2019re out there with their efforts with one of the big distributors. And just curious to know that there might be six or some months into that initiative, your thoughts if you need to augment your selling efforts more specific to the GP channel. Thanks guys.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Certainly, I will take that one. John, I guess what I would say is that when we look at that strategy, obviously there are GPs that are placing implants. We have GPs that are placing implants. And that\u2019s a phenomenon that you very much see in the U.S. market piece because you clearly have a specialist general practitioner delineation. When you go outside in other markets, obviously you have all types of individuals placing implants. So that strategy maybe is a little bit muted. At this point in time, we can\u2019t see that we\u2019ve seen major movements as it relates to GPs placing implants. As we see the North American market today, still the majority of implants are placed by specialists, oral surgeons, [peridontists], prosthodontics. And I think that is -- we believe that trend will continue. Certainly, that strategy can bear fruit, but it would take a very significant move to see it, is I guess is what I would say just because of the predominance. We estimate that roughly 90% of implants are placed by specialists today. So that can kind of give you an idea of the magnitude of change that you would need in order to really see that impact.", "At this point in time, we work very actively with GPs on a restorative side. We have obviously a good digital portfolio which supports that as well. From our standpoint, general practitioners have a very positive financial situation in doing the restoration on implants, and we continue to work very, very hard to support that end of the business. If they have a desire to place, we support them on that as well.", "Operator", "There are no additional questions. I will turn the call\u2019s back over to Derek Leckow for any additional or closing remarks.", "Derek Leckow", "Okay, thank you all very much for your interest in DENTSPLY. That concludes our conference call. If you have other questions, I\u2019m available for follow-up. Thank you. Bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Derek Leckow", "Thank you very much Ellisa, and many thanks to each of you for joining us today to discuss DENTSPLY International\u2019s third quarter 2011 results. Joining us on the call from our location in Europe is Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; and I\u2019m here in New York with Chris Clark, our President and COO; and Bill Jellison, our Senior Vice President and CFO. Each of us will have some prepared remarks and then, we\u2019ll be glad to answer any questions that you may have. I\u2019d hope you all had a chance to review our press release and supplemental materials, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release and these materials are available for downloading on our website www.dentsply.com in the Investor Relations area.", "Before we get started, it is important to note this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. And a recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.", "As you can see in the release, our results for this quarter reflect the Astra Tech acquisition and included a number of non-recurring items and a substantial increase in non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles. In an effort to provide clarity, from the distortion of some of these items, our comments on this call focuses on results including certain adjustments which are noted on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the release. You\u2019ll note that our forward-looking earnings guidance also reflects results excluding all the related amortization charges. This information is also highlighted in the supplemental material we\u2019ve provided on our website.", "With that, I\u2019d like now turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Bret Wise. Bret?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "Thank you, Derek and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call this morning. This morning we are very pleased to announce record sales for our third quarter of 2011. As noted in the release and as Derek mentioned, our results in this period of course are heavily influenced by the Astra Tech acquisition, including a number of non-recurring items and also the impact of the product outage in our orthodontics business. Accordingly throughout the call, we\u2019ll provide you with insights into what our results would have been without the guidance.", "We\u2019ll also update you on how we see the global dental market developing at this point then provide with some updates on both the Astra Tech integration and a status of our orthodontics recovery plans.", "First, from a revenue perspective, we recorded revenue, which was a record revenue for our third quarter of $619.8 million as reported in $563.8 million ex-precious metals. Total sales growth [XPM] increased 14% has the strongest growth rate that we\u2019ve seen since second quarter of 2008. Our constant currency growth was a positive 9.6% in the quarter including a negative internal growth of 1.1%. However, as you know, that\u2019s heavily influenced by the product supply outage in our orthodontics business. And our acquisition growth in the period was 10.7% reflecting the Astra Tech acquisition for one month as well as five other smaller transactions that we completed in the last year. (Inaudible) growth rate of course are inclusive of our Japanese and our orthodontics business, both of which are heavily impacted by the natural disaster that occurred in Japan at March. If you look at the internal growth excluding the sales in the Japanese market and orthodontics the internal growth rate was positive 3.6% for the quarter and constant currency growth was over 15% for the quarter.", "Our internal growth benefitted from mid single digit growth in both the tier side consumable category and also our specialty products and of course that exclude the orthodontics products and that was offset by a slight negative internal growth number from the prosthetics group.", "Our currency translation was also positive in the quarter; it added 4.4% of sales. Total growth through nine months is 9.5% including constant currency growth of 5.0%. Internal growth through nine months is a positive 0.9% and a plus 0.39% excluding orthodontics and our sales industry in Japan.", "For geographic internal growth, I want to give it you both as reported for the quarter and then also separately without orthodontics and the effects from the market in Japan. So as reported, internal growth was a negative 2.3% for the US, negative 3.8% for Europe, and a positive 5.3% for the rest of the world. Again, that\u2019s heavily impacted by the supply outage in orthodontics. So excluding orthodontics and our sales in Japan, internal growth for the quarter was a positive 3.2% in the US, a positive 0.3% in Europe, and a positive 10.8% for rest of the world. And in Derek\u2019s opening remarks he commented that there is some supplemental information available at our website, which includes the internal growth both with and without the orthodontics and Japanese effect.", "Looking at these results again, ex-ortho and Japan there are couple of I think, obvious implications. First, the US market has clearly improved at least from our perspective it has. We saw a good growth year-over-year in consumables and specialty again, excluding orthodontics of course, and lab was also positive.", "In Europe, it\u2019s also clear that the market there overall has slowed a bit, however, it\u2019s important to note that the extend varies quite a bit by region and product class. Our results in Europe were impacted by more than a four-percentage point by the decline in precious metal alloys, the market decline in precious metal alloys, as volumes in that market have declined substantially on record gold prices. Also I suspect it\u2019s not surprising that there continues to be some rough market dynamics in Southern Europe, but conditions in Northern Countries seem much more stable.", "Given the economic turmoil we see in the southern regions of Europe, we believe there is some continued risk of slowness in that region for the rest of the year and we\u2019ve reflected that in our updated guidance that we\u2019re providing today.", "With respect to the rest of the world, our 10.8% internal growth again, ex-ortho in Japan for the quarter and 10.6% year-to-date reflects continue strong opportunities in many dental markets throughout the world. We are seeing good growth rates in the Pacific Rim, Latin America, Middle East and Australia. So these are pretty diverse markets of course, but to us this in 2011, many of these are moving in the right direction.", "Overall, despite some doom and gloom talk about the global economy, the industry continues to chuck along as it has in the past, pretty resistant to economic fluctuations.", "As far as our own results are concerned, we continue to be pleased with what we see as above market growth overall, and again ex-orthodontic outage. And we\u2019re particularly happy with the performance of our new product pipeline. Like, I\u2019d say customer reaction to the range of new products we\u2019ve launched this year across various of our strategic business units has been really positive.", "With regard to earnings, we\u2019re pleased with the results, which were slightly better than what we had expected. Our earnings per share on a GAAP basis were down slightly, but this is a pretty messy quarter with the impacts from the acquisition and the orthodontic supply headwind and several other items of note of course.", "Bill is going to provide you with some details on these items whilst a bridge to our non-GAAP results probably brief here. But overall on a non-GAAP basis, EPS was $0.46 per share that\u2019s essentially the same as last year, but this is after a $0.04 to $0.05 per share reduction from the orthodontics business and the business in Japan. So those businesses would have been flat with the prior year our non-GAAP earnings would have been up approximately 10% for the quarter.", "Regarding the orthodontics recovery plan, Chris is going to speak to this in more detail in a minute. But I think in general, it\u2019s important to note that it feels like we\u2019re getting very close to an inflection point in this business. I think the earnings drag the next quarter maybe a little higher than in the third quarter, but we expect to see sequential improvement in results as we enter next year. We\u2019ll have some tough year-over-year comparisons for the next with say, two to three quarters, but we believe this unit will become a source of earnings growth again in the back half of next year as we recapture market share.", "We\u2019re also very happy to have closed the Astra Tech transaction earlier than we had previously thought possible. Our two teams are working very closely together on integration and prioritizing our opportunities. I think its also fare to say that having now spent close to two months in the integration, we\u2019re enthusiastic about the opportunity and likewise, we\u2019re very comfortable with the assumptions we made in the transaction including the accretion numbers that we had provided to you previously.", "We remain confident, this transaction will be accretive even in 2011 without substantial synergies and of course, we expect the earnings growth to accelerate there after.", "In our reported results we of course include all of Astra Tech acquisition growth, but had we reflected their organic growth in September the one month that we own them of course, it would have been accretive to the growth rates that we\u2019re reporting to you today. Overall, I\u2019d say on the Astra Tech, acquisition is going very well at this point.", "Lastly, on earnings guidance, this quarter we\u2019re reflecting guidance excluding the amortization of purchase intangibles from acquisitions as Derek had noted. For all of our acquisitions prior to July 1, 2011 this amounts to about a penny per share per quarter or about $0.04 per year. So, given that this was not in our prior guidance of $1.92 to $2 per share for all 2011, you should think of that prior guidance is now being $0.04 higher or $1.96 the $2.04 per share for all 2011. And today of course, we\u2019re increasing that guidance to $2.01 to $2.07 per share for the full year reflecting, I think a number of factors. These include on the positive side accretion from the Astra Tech acquisition, growth prospects for the remainder of the year in the US and the rest of world regions, and slightly less of a drag that we previously expected from the orthodontics and Japanese business for the full year.", "On the negative side, we can now see the conditions in Europe will likely be a bit slower, and the effects of currency are likely to be much less positive in the fourth quarter than what we\u2019ve seen thus far for the year.", "But overall, we\u2019re pleased to be increasing the guidance by $0.05 on the low end and $0.03 on the high end for all 2011.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Chris who is going to provide us with an update on the orthodontic recovery plan and also the Astra Tech integration. Chris?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Thank you, Bret and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to take few moments as Bret mentioned and try to provide some deeper insights into our progress on the orthodontics front as well as an update on the integration efforts relative to Astra Tech.", "With respect to orthodontics, we\u2019re receiving increased shipments from our key Japanese supplier. Although, I should note that this improvement continues to be gradual. You may recall that I mentioned on our last call that we\u2019ve just received an initial shipment of self-ligating product from our supplier. We are now generally receiving weekly shipments of both self-ligating and non self-ligating products although with levels well below our requirements and our historical levels. We\u2019re basically at this point receiving more frequent, but still only partial shipments.", "Our suppliers are continuing to make efforts to expand capacity and we continue to anticipate return to full availability across the various product lines sometime during the first half of next year.", "To attempt to help bridge the gap on the non-proprietary products that we received from them, we are continuing in the interim to market alternatively source product received from other suppliers, marketed under the resolved brand name. We\u2019re currently allocating available product from our Japanese supplier by geographic region and by product line, as we want to ensure we can meet as higher percentage of demand as possible in an individual market for specific brands.", "As we entered the fourth quarter, I think we are in better shape than three months ago. As we entered Q3, we are basically close to a complete product outage from our Japanese supplier. Now, we\u2019re receiving consistent albeit incomplete shipments and that we expect this to gradually improve as we move forward.", "Excluding the impact of a particularly tough comparison this coming quarter, we believe should begin to see sequential improvements in the business. Due to the stronger prior year period results, the sequential improvement will like to be masked in the fourth quarter, but should be more evident moving forward from there.", "So to summarize, I think we\u2019re making the gradual sequential progress that we anticipated previously recognizing that this will be a multiyear recovery effort to get back to the market share that we enjoyed prior to the Japanese natural disaster.", "Before moving off of ortho, I\u2019d like to take a moment and publically comment our orthodontics team for their dedication to help our customers through this difficult period. Their professionalism and focus have been exemplary and reinforce our commitment to ensure that we keep the right organization in place to lead us back to strong above market growth as the supply situation improves, recognizing that this does create negative short term impact on our operating margin.", "I\u2019d now like to provide some brief comments on the Astra Tech integration efforts. We continue to be very impressed with the caliber of the Astra Tech team, as well as very pleased with the similarities between the cultures of our two companies. Their commitment, innovation and clinical reference (inaudible) really appears are own. And these similarities will certainly pay dividends for us as we move forward.", "With respect to the integration process, we have initiated a joint integration team with dedicated resources from both DENTSPLY and Astra Tech with the support of external consulting resources all focused on maximizing the value of transaction. Their efforts are focused on identifying and implementing the optimal structures and processes to maximize the value of both the dental and the healthcare businesses, achieve our sales and operating synergy objectives, and not much larger implant business to further increase market share in the premium implants moving forward.", "I would characterize the approach of the Astra Tech and DENTSPLY teams in this process as both very engaged and highly collaborative, and the process has a lot of positive energy focused on the significant opportunities created by the transaction. Our assessment is that these opportunities before us are even more compelling than what we anticipated through due diligence particularly with respect to the aggregate natural implant and digital dentistry portfolios.", "I will also add that we are pleased with the business performance of both the Astra Tech and our own implant business during this initial integration period as the teams are capably juggling the demands on the ongoing business for the additional focus on integration activities.", "While we have not yet seen announcements of Q3 results from some of our public implant competitors, both the Astra Tech and [free event] implant platforms grew upper mid single digits organically during the third quarter indicating that both implant portfolios are continuing to gain market share.", "The urology business also continues to perform well with steady growth behind the new compact LoFric catheter in particular.", "I look forward to providing additional updates as to our integration efforts on future quarterly calls. So I now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison, who will cover the financial results for the quarter in greater detail.", "William R. Jellison", "", "Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Bret already discussed our sales growth within the quarter, but I\u2019d like to add a couple of additional comments. First our geographic mix of sales ex-precious metals in the third quarter of 2011 included the US at 36%, Europe represented 40% and the rest of world was 24% of sales.", "Our rest of the world is now nearly 25% of our total sales, these regions continue to gain importance as they\u2019re growth is expected to continue to outperform US and European markets. Our sales mix will shift a few points more once Astra Tech is fully included for the entire period as its sales are obviously more heavily weighted within Europe.", "Despite the recent strengthening of the dollar within the quarter, we\u2019re still benefited from a slightly weaker dollar year-over-year in the third quarter, benefitting our top line growth by 4.4%.", "Our earnings per share also benefited from the translation benefits of a weaker dollar, but are being partially offset by higher transaction related impacts, as we sell many products produced in Europe to other parts of the world, but this is negatively impacting our gross profit margins within the period.", "The acquisition of Astra Tech does increase the volatility changes in FX rates that have on our sales and earnings on as more of our sales and our production is now located outside of the US. We are most impacted on sales by changes in the euro and our purchases and cost structures are most impacted by the Euro, Swiss Franc, Swedish krona, and also the Japanese yen. We will be utilizing additional systematic cash flow hedges on certain transactions in the future to help minimize the volatility that these FX fluctuations may otherwise have on our business. And at current exchange rates, we expect the fourth quarter impact of exchange to be closer to neutral on our bottom line than the positive impact we\u2019ve had in the first few quarters.", "As Derek mentioned and as you can see in our earnings release, the quarter included a number of items, which impacted our results, which we have identified as non-GAAP adjustments. Most of the following comments exclude the impacts of those items.", "Gross profit margins on an adjusted basis as a percentage of sales, ex-precious metal content in the third quarter of 2011 were 55.9% compared to 55.7% for the third quarter of 2010. When compared to the same period last year, we were positively impacted by improved pricing and product mix as we benefit from stronger gross margins in the Astra Tech business. However, these benefits were nearly offset by negative impacts of foreign exchange movements.", "The negative impact of foreign exchange rates on the gross margin rate in the quarter was approximately 80 basis points. So on a constant currency basis, gross margins were up nearly 4-percentage point on an adjusted basis. The Astra Tech is expected to have a positive mix impact on gross margin rates over the next year as this business again is consolidated into the company\u2019s results.", "Our SG&A included approximately $13 million of acquisition and integration expenses and the other adjustments. Absentees cost, SG&A on an adjusted basis would have been $218 million or approximately 38.7% of sales ex-precious metals, within the third quarter, versus 36.6% in the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Both the impacts from supporting our ortho business during the supply outage and the addition of recent acquisitions will have a negative impact on this percentage rate until this time next year when these items are fully reflected in both years.", "Astra Tech, which now runs with much higher SG&A expenses than our base business is expected to have a greater negative mix impact on SG&A expenses as a percent of sales over the next year as this business again is fully consolidated into the company\u2019s results. With out the impacts of ortho and the Japan situation and our acquisition expenses, we would have been about flat as a percentage of sales in the period on an adjusted basis.", "Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis were 17.2% compared to 19.2% last year in the same period. These rates were negatively impacted this year from the costs incurred supporting the infrastructure of our orthodontic business, impacts of FX movements, and from the combination and higher expense levels of recent acquisitions.", "Astra Tech is also expected to have a negative mix impact on operating income rates over the next year as its business is consolidated into the company\u2019s results and as their current operating performance is below DENTSPLY\u2019s operating income levels as a percentage of sales. We expect that this impact will be mitigated over time as we realize the benefits of synergies of the combined businesses.", "As Bret noted, our Japanese natural disaster have negatively impacted our earnings per share by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 in the third quarter. This impact will likely be approximately $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of this year as it was a stronger quarter for our ortho business last year.", "It is expected to begin to show sequential signs of improvement as we finish up the year and also enter into next year. Even with sequential improvement though, we expect this business will have a negative impact on results in the first half of next year measured on a year-over-year basis.", "Net interest and other expense in the third quarter on a reported basis was $20.8 million compared to $5.3 million last year in the third quarter. This increase in expense resulted primarily from net interest expense associated with the acquisition of Astra Tech, and approximately $12 million of expenses associated with the closing of that transaction, which we highlighted as an adjustment for our non-GAAP EPS. We were also slightly benefited by higher interest income as rates have increased slightly from last year.", "During the quarter, we had a successful closing of our acquisition of Astra Tech and the financing associated with that transaction. The transaction was financed with approximately $650 million of cash and approximately $1.2 billion of additional debt, primarily financed by issuing public debt with maturities ranging from 2 years to 10 years at an all in average cost of approximately 3.6%.", "Our reported tax rate for the quarter is not really meaningful as there are significant tax adjustments that we removed from our non-GAAP numbers. The most notable of this is a $47 million tax benefit that is being recognized based on the expected recovery of net operating tax loss carry forwards that we will now likely recover as a consequence of the Astra Tech acquisition.", "On an adjusted basis excluding tax adjustments, our operating tax rate for this quarter was 23.8% and year-to-date is now 23%.", "The tax rate continues to have a slightly favorable impact compared to last year and is the result of two items. First, we are benefiting from a more favorable geographic mix as our US based income has been reduced due to the impacts of a weaker dollar and the negative impacts of our supply outage of orthodontic products. We expect this impact will gradually go away as our sales and earnings in this business are rebuilt over the next few years.", "We are also benefiting from our recent acquisition of Astra Tech. With this acquisition, we will be able to more effectively deploy our cash flow and as a result, much less cash will be taxed when repatriated to the US, which is resulting in a lower average tax rate in 2011. We also believe this rate will be reasonable when looking toward next year based on current tax loss. The announced acquisition of Astra Tech allows us to efficiently utilize not only our current cash balances, but also our future foreign cash flows.", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the third quarter of 2011 on an as reported basis was $60.6 million or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $63.7 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010. Net income attributable to DENTSPLY on an adjusted non-GAAP basis was $66.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in 2011, compared to $66.3 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010.", "Our supplemental material provides a more detailed bridge of the adjustments that are highlighted in both our quarter as well as our nine-month or year-to-date numbers.", "As Bret noted, the current year number is reduced by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per share due to the supply outage in orthodontics, absent that, we would have shown some nice earnings growth within this quarter.", "Cash flow from operating activities in the first nine months of 2011 was $246 million compared to $249 million in the same period last year. But keep in mind; we had a number of payments in the quarter for acquisitions, financing related costs, legal settlements and other items of approximately $40 million, which negatively impacted operating cash flows within this period.", "Capital expenditures were $45 million in the first nine months of the year with depreciation and amortization now at about $64 million.", "Inventory days were 104 at the end of the third quarter of 2011 compared to 106 days at the end of the third quarter and 103 days at the end of last year. These levels now reflect the addition of Astra Tech inventory as well.", "Accounts receivable days were 60 days including a slightly higher days from Astra Tech at the end of the third quarter of 2011, compared to 59 days at the end of the third quarter in 2010. At the end of the third quarter of 2011, we had $82 million in cash and short-term investments and our total debt was $1.84 billion at the end of the third quarter.", "Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately $80 million of our stock or approximately 2.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $36. Based on the company\u2019s authorization to remain up to $34 million of treasury shares, we have now approximately 12 million shares available for repurchase. However, as we\u2019ve now completed our acquisition of Astra Tech, our preference will be working to pay some this debt down, before we utilize the remaining authorization although, we will more likely continue to offset our options.", "Finally as Bret stated, we are pleased to be increasing our earnings guidance for 2011. As you recall, our previous earnings guidance was $1.92 to $2 per share on an adjusted basis. As we are now identifying all the amortization of purchased intangibles on a non-GAAP item, we wanted to clearly point out that amortization from transactions completed before July 1 of 2011 would add $0.04 to our previous guidance making our prior guidance on a comparable basis $1.96 to $2.04. As we look toward year-end, we\u2019re comfortable raising our guidance for earnings on an adjusted basis to $2.01 to $2.07 per diluted share. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thanks for your support and we\u2019d be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We will go first to John Kreger from William Blair.", "John Kreger \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC.", "", "Hi, thanks very much. Bill, I think you said in your prepared remarks that the weaker dollar helped the bottom line, but can you quantify by how much?", "William R. Jellison", "Yeah, it was probably in the range of $.01 to $.02 per share roughly this quarter.", "John Kreger \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC.", "Excellent, thanks. And any kind of early thoughts on the 2012 outlook; I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not going to give official guidance until the next quarter, but any other things we should be thinking about as we adjust models such as new product introductions and so forth?", "William R. Jellison", "Yeah, I mean at this point, John, we really don\u2019t \u2013 can give out any kind of direction for 2012 and we won\u2019t be really doing that until our next quarter conference call.", "John Kreger \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC.", "Okay, thanks. And then just one final one; can you talk a little bit more broadly about the trends you saw across your different implant lines. I think you quantified the Astra implant lines. How did your own implant business do?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yeah. Hi John, it\u2019s Chris. Both of those grew upper mid-single digits. So if you look at it, we were pretty pleased with both of those lines and I think that\u2019s indicative of gaining market share and behind two really good platforms.", "John Kreger \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC.", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "We will go next to Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thank you. Good morning guys. Bret, I was hoping I could start with you, the US organic growth number 3.2%, pretty impressive. Wondering, how much of that do you think is maybe DENTSPLY specific with some of your new endo products and other products out there versus market just because that\u2019s a little bit different than maybe what we were hearing for the market as a broader comment for third quarter?", "Bret W. Wise", "Jeff, the strength we saw in the third quarter was pretty strong across all lines. The endo products, the new products in endo are doing very well. The new products in restoratives are doing pretty well, the implant line did very well, lab was positive but obviously was below the average growth rate that we mentioned there. So it\u2019s interesting because I\u2019ve seen a number of surveys which says things must be weakening in the US and we are just one company but we have a pretty broad sales base in US and we are seeing strength across, I would say, numerous platforms that we have today, of course the one exception that is Orthodontics for obvious reasons. It\u2019s not isolated to one line or another at this point.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "", "All right, that\u2019s helpful. Can you provide any color maybe on what US or worldwide endo or general consumables might have done?", "", "Bret W. Wise", "Yeah. Worldwide the consumables were very strong kind of mid single digits. The specialty businesses in total were kind of mid-single digits excluding ortho, organic of course. So I think I mentioned that in the prepared remarks both consumables and specialty products ex-ortho were mid-single digits worldwide.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Great, And then Bill a question for you just on the Astra Tech side; you previously guided to the first 12-months being $0.12 to $0.17 accretive. Obviously Europe has slowed here a bit, dental implant market you know plus or minus may have changed a bit, but you also eliminated intercompany loan hedge you\u2019ve got the Swissy now take to the euro that might help manufacturing cost on dental implants in Switzerland. So just wondering you know how you\u2019re conceptually thinking about that $0.12 to $0.17 guidance; will you update that number or at least qualitatively talk around it?", "William R. Jellison", "", "Jeff I don\u2019t think that we are planning and talking anything specifically about the Astra Tech business or our broader-based any of our specific divisions in the future as well either. Although Bret, clearly pointed out that, as well as Chris, that our integration processes I think are moving along positively.", "We are very impressed with the wide range of talent that exists in the associates within that team. I think both teams are working closely together. And at this point, we are very confident that this year will show accretion within that area. And I would say that there is a number of factors that obviously impact that acquisition in the growth rate, but we are pleased with how our regular business is running right now and we are pleased with the opportunities that this acquisition brings to us.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "And last just maybe a follow-up there Bill; on the accretion of Astra Tech, I think in the past you guys have talked about it being back-end loaded in that first year as well. Do we think in fourth quarter that we\u2019re actually on the cash side or even with amortization included, get any accretion out of it or is that more of a 2012 of that?", "William R. Jellison", "", "No, we are expecting that it will be an accretive, accretive to earnings this year already.", "", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "", "Already. Okay, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got thanks guys.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Block from Suntrust.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay, great, thanks. Bill, you maybe clarified this with your last call, but I guess I might even ask you to parch it a little bit more, I mean essentially even after all the moving parts, you\u2019re raising guidance by about $0.04, it looks like currency probably moved to a little bit against you since the last time you updated us when you closed the acquisition early. So is there a way to maybe even parch the $0.04 in terms of what\u2019s coming from the accretion from Astra Tech, what if anything moved against you from FX and what\u2019s attributable to call it core DENTSPLY business model?", "William R. Jellison", "Well, I think probably the only one piece that you can really pick out based on kind of what we said there was I gave you roughly an idea on kind of how the FX was within the third quarter. We\u2019ve said that that's obviously changing and it's going to probably look more neutral to us moving forward. So obviously that has, is more of a headwind in relationship to kind of what we, maybe we previously expected in July.", "But I'd say the other categories really across the board that Bret pointed out, both the broader-based markets with our base business performance, the performance within our ortho business that is probably a little bit better than what we had expected in July, but right at the midpoint of kind of what we originally expected at the beginning of this year when the earthquake first happened. And I think that he also clearly stated that we\u2019re confident that we will have accretion from at least the acquisition this year.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay, great. And then maybe turn over to the orthodontic\u2019s business, I just want to make sure I\u2019m thinking about this properly. So $0.06 impact expected roughly in the fourth quarter; that would be the peak, working your way down from there but still negative in the first half of \u201912 and then crossover in the back half of \u201812. Is that correct? And the second part of the question would be; you mentioned increased shipments from the supplier. Is there a way to put a percentage on, you know hey, we\u2019re now getting 20% of ourselves while getting volume back or 30%? Thanks guys.", "Christopher T. Clark", "", "Yeah, it\u2019s Chris. I would say Jonathan the progression that you described is pretty similar, pretty accurate to the way we\u2019re thinking about it. So from that angle, I think that\u2019s correct.", "In terms of, I\u2019m not going to comment in terms of a specific percentage mainly for competitive reasons, but you know, as I indicated before, we\u2019re getting more regular, but partial shipments at this stage. It is getting better, it is a gradual process, they are continuing to expand capacity, but again, obviously this was a tremendously significant event, obviously for them and they\u2019re poise and they\u2019re resilient, but it is a gradual process.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "Okay, great. And last couple of questions. First one, Bret for you, I know you don\u2019t like to give a lot of color inter-quarter, but again, your US number was quite honestly better than what we were expecting. Was there anything inter-quarter that you sensed or was there pretty much stable July though September maybe even any commentary into October, if you could. And then, Chris the last one for you would be, are you now meeting demand on WaveOne. You know, that looked like that it was going to be a great product for you guys I think, you were trying to catch up to the demand last quarter, where are you, right now? Thanks guys.", "Bret W. Wise", "", "Okay. I\u2019ll go first and then, Chris can comment on WaveOne. With respect to within the quarter, I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s meaningful to try to measure the business with the markets and weak implements or even a monthly increment. Particularly the third quarter, because Europe in particular gets to be very slow during the vacation period of late July to late August. But I think overall, with respect to the global markets we saw really good, strong conditions in the US and many of the rest of the world categories Europe did slow, as we commented, but I don\u2019t think there is any trend within the quarter, but you\u2019re asking specifically about the US. If there was any trend specifically in the quarter that would make us believe that it vary greatly from one period to another. Chris, you want to talk about the last topic?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yeah, regarding WaveOne, I mean, obviously, we\u2019re very pleased with the market reaction to it. We increased the focus to actually we were leader in terms of the introduction in the US than we were in Europe and the rest of the world. So in Q3, we were just beginning to get some momentum on that in the US. What I would say is that the backorder, we still do have backorders. We have increased capacity and certainly running hard at the present problem that we have. But I would characterize the level of the backorders is below what they were when we chatted three months ago.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to a Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.", "Verdell Walker \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Good morning, everyone this is Verdell Walker in for Bob Jones. I just want to start really, really quickly on the Japan situation. I see you guys are backing out from orthodontic business continuity costs in your non\u2013GAAP reconciliation. I was just trying to get a sense of like an addition to the sales force expenses that you are going to be incurring, maintaining your sales force to this. What are these other expenses that you\u2019re going to be incurring as you deal with this situation, is it like promotional activity or anything else like that, just little bit more color on what that is exactly.", "Bret W. Wise", "", "I think all the promotional related activities of launching new products and everything else or platforms will all be running through regular operations. We would not be excluding any of that. Some of the continuity cost areas are really for support cost to ensure that the employees throughout this period are solely committed to the business. They are staying with the business and ultimately going to be driving the business on the backside of it as we ultimately get new products.", "Verdell Walker \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thanks. My next question is could you just talk a little bit around your debt repayment assumptions. I know that\u2019s a big focus for you guys even more so than the share repurchases. Just trying to get an idea how you\u2019re thinking about progressing that?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "Well, I think on you can obviously see the level of cash flow that we\u2019ve already got kind of this year on a year-to-date basis. We generally generate significant amounts in both operating cash flow as well as free cash flow. Our expectation for that cash flow moving forward here and the primary focus on that will ultimately be for debt repayment. So as we get to kind of the back end of next year, we would be expecting to have paid down a nice piece of the debt already I mean, probably really for the next two years that\u2019s our primary focus.", "That does not mean that we might not have some tuck in acquisitions that we still do within kind of that first two years, but if we did, I would expect that those would be relatively small. So you can expect to use the majority of kind of the free cash flow side for debt repayment at least in the first couple of years. So, roughly a good kind of probably rule of thumb is maybe in the $250 million range possibly plus a little bit depending on what availability we\u2019ve got to do that pay down.", "Verdell Walker \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great and last question. If you\u2019ve already answered this on Astra Tech, I apologize. I had to hop on from another call, but at the time you announced Astra Tech you discussed like a current implant market growth maybe around 4.5% with the idea that your implant business both combined and Astra Tech and legacy DENTSPLY to grow above that if that was the assumption then like, what\u2019s your assumption now in the growth outlook for the implant market. And if those accretion targets you had talked about at $0.12 to $0.17 in the first 12 months haven\u2019t changed, what is the offset if your market growth assumption has come down and similarly, your original expectations for [years] three were about $0.30 to $0.40 if I remember correctly, so what were their marketing growth assumptions behind that guidance?", "Bret W. Wise", "Yeah, well this is, Bret, I\u2019ll comment on that briefly. At the time of the announcement, I think we said in the near-term, we expected the dental implant market to kind of grow low-to-mid single-digits. We think that longer-term it could be high single-digits maybe very low double-digits, but that\u2019s we didn\u2019t assume that recovery would happen immediately we thought that would take some time.", "And that seems to be the case at this point. We do see some companies in that market you know growing mid-single to even a little bit stronger to mid single digits we\u2019re in that category, but I think one other things we commented on in our guidance today is that, we\u2019ve now been you know through the integration process, been in the company for 60-days. We\u2019ve been able to look at the assumptions we made and in our view they were very solid even now that we have more information and in fact, that was one of the reasons that we were positive about the accretion number in 2011. So we\u2019re comfortable with the assumptions we made including those that we gave to the investment community at time of transaction.", "Verdell Walker \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay, so that $0.12 to $0.17 is still in tact?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "Yeah, we are comfortable with the accretion numbers we gave to the Street at the time of transaction.", "", "Verdell Walker \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay, perfect. Thanks so much for the questions.", "", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll go next [Yudan Wang] from Deutsche Bank", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Thanks very much. It would be great if you can give us a sense of how your legacy dental implant business performed in the region. So US, ex-US and also how Astra Tech\u2019s dental business performed in those regions. Thank you.", "Bret W. Wise", "This is, Bret. We don\u2019t give breakdowns by regions for any of our product lines and I don\u2019t think we should start that with the dental implants. I think the comments that Chris made earlier with respected to both our system and Astra Tech system growing, I don\u2019t exactly \u2013 remember the exact words you used, Chris, but like strong mid-single digits?", "Christopher T. Clark", "", "Yeah. Up or mid-single digits.", "Bret W. Wise", "", "Yeah. Globally is the guidance we\u2019re really standing behind or the information we want externally. So, we\u2019re not going to give a regional breakdown of the various product lines we have.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Are you able to say whether the US business grew faster than the ex-US business?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "Yes. The US business did grow faster than the outside US business.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And that grace that you indicated for Astra Tech\u2019s dental business seems to suggest that it has actually slowed in the third quarter by, I'd say that compared to the momentum that it had in the beginning of the year. Can you talk about what have driven this slowdown?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "I'm not sure that that's correct actually that it has slowed. So, I\u2019m not going to comment on whether it slowed or not. I don't think that it has slowed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then finally on the integration of the Astra Tech dental business, can you talk about how that integration would proceed and how you would operate it with DENTSPLY\u2019s existing implant business given that the way these two businesses are well managed, were very different?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "We\u2019ve deepened the integration process. As Chris mentioned, we've got a team of Astra Tech executives and team of DENTSPLY executives working on that. We haven't made any public announcements of how the business is going to be integrated at this point. So, when we get to the point of being ready to announce that publicly, we\u2019ll pass that on to the shareholder group as well.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Presumably it's also too early to say how long it will take you to integrate in what sort of disruptions we should factor in at this stage?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "Yeah. There's no timeframe announced for integration. I think both systems continue to perform very well even with the distraction by the way, of being sold at Astra Tech and now with the integration underway. They are going to implant business, it\u2019s operating very well as is ours.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We will go next to Steve Busha from Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Busha \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Bill, I wonder if you could spend a bit more time trying to quantify the changes to the lines of the P&L, particularly SG&A and gross margins as you look at some of the non-organic change given the Astra Tech integration and the updated treatment of amortization; and if you could give us a sense for how that might be different in the fourth quarter given that you\u2019ll have a full quarter of Astra Tech that would be really helpful. Thanks.", "William R. Jellison", "Yeah, I think this is \u2013 we had Astra Tech in our business for one-month year and we did say that as we move forward, two things will in essence be shown into a little greater degree on the impacts. First of, Astra Tech\u2019s business in general had higher average margins than DENTSPLY\u2019s average business, so you should expect that that benefit on the margin side for that mix benefit of the acquisition will be greater in the 4Q and as we move forward.", "The flip side of that is that the overhead structure of their current business is obviously well above DENTSPLY\u2019s levels, so our SG&A related side is going to be higher and it will obviously be driving, that impact will obviously be nearly three times the impact within the fourth quarter. But as far specific expectations beyond that we aren\u2019t really giving any additional guidance.", "Steve Busha \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, on sticking with Astra Tech; well number one, thank you for the commentary and the granularity on the implant businesses. Number two; building on that, can you comment on the organic growth for Astra Tech as a whole and for the non-implants, the medical business lines and then hopefully give us a sense for how that is trending relative to the first half of the year?", "", "William R. Jellison", "I'm not going to give any specific guidance on that, other than to say, the healthcare side of their business performed very well in the month we\u2019ve owned them, I mean we got all 30 days of their numbers and our numbers. We said that we acquired that business and intend to run it because we like the business model both the growth rates and the margins and the creativity that\u2019s in that business. So the comment that Chris made of course was about their implant business, but I would say it appears even the healthcare business has done very well also.", "Steve Busha \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thank you again and have a great morning.", "Operator", "We will go next to Larry Marsh from Barclays Capital.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey guys, good morning. This is (inaudible) filling in for Larry. Bret, just a quick question for you. I want to follow-up on some of your Europe comments. I think it came in a bit below we\u2019re expecting obviously, you expanded on some trouble in the Southern countries in precious metal alloys and couple of other things. I know you guys aren\u2019t giving guidance for 12 but sort of qualitatively now one month into Q4 and looking towards 2012, are some of these issues sort of still sort of going on here and some we could expect the next few quarters before we kind of resumed some of the growth we use to seeing in over in Europe or it is more of a progress to quarter specific issue?", "Bret W. Wise", "The issues in Southern Europe, I don\u2019t believe those are quarter specific. I think that the economic situation there is going to be difficult for some time and we have seen the difficulty they\u2019ve had coming up with a real solution; there is an announcement today, I guess this morning, that they appear to have made some progress there. But at least with respect to Southern Europe I'm not sure that\u2019s isolated this quarter. Northern Europe continues to perform reasonably well to much more of a steady environment, and I don\u2019t see any reason to change our view on it at this point on the northern regions of the European continent.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay thanks, it\u2019s very helpful. And Chris, may be a quick one for you. Just (inaudible) implant discussion. Just (inaudible) some of the pricing dynamics here from margin perspective particularly on the premium implants side. Could you just comment on you know (inaudible) the pricing dynamics change throughout the past, you know one, two years or so that you\u2019ve noticed and now coming into 2012 here kind of the pricing dynamics in the premium side of the market; have those changed materially at all kind of sort of as it\u2019s expected.", "Christopher T. Clark", "", "Yeah, we really have not seen any significant changes in pricing dynamics. We\u2019ve been able to certainly on the accretive side has on price increases and have done that relative to both product line. So from that angle we are not seeing the need for significant increases and discounting or anything like that in terms of driving the growth rates that we\u2019ve seen.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Scott Green from Bank of America.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Hi, thanks for the questions. So first could you elaborate a little more on your product launch outlook for 2012, I know you've spoken a lot about how successful the 2011 line up has been and to the extent that it\u2019s been supporting results this year; how do you think about the line up next year on a relative basis?", "Bret W. Wise", "I\u2019ll make two comments; one is, new products and brands introduced in the dentistry take several years to kind of ramp up, so even though we\u2019re seeing some benefits from the new product launches this year, we should see continued benefit from both same products for the next couple years. The pipeline of products that have yet to be launched and that will likely be launched in 2012, our view is kind of a normal level at this point. 2011 was a little bit higher than normal and I'd say 2012 was more than normal level. We can probably give an update on the status of the pipeline when we talk on our year-end call.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, all right. Thanks, and then in the US, looking back, I think in the third quarter of 2010, you had spoken about a tough equipment comp that maybe drove a little weaker results in the US and I was wondering if that maybe set the stage for an easier comp into this quarter or do you view the results in the US (inaudible) in ortho as a good run rate to consider going forward?", "Bret W. Wise", "Chris, I'm going to ask if you have any specific comments on\u2026", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yeah. No, the small equipment comp really was not a significant factor in terms of the Q3 results. So I would say, with respect to Q3 that\u2019s above what we think. We think that\u2019s a pretty accurate reflection what the business is doing.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Could you update us, maybe I missed this part, any price increases you implemented on October 1 and if that might have had any pull in from the fourth quarter?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yeah. I mean we implement price increases on most of our consumable businesses in the US and in Europe. October 1, that have been the timing for the last several years, so that's in the base period as well. I would say in aggregate, the impact in terms of any impact form Q4 into Q3 is very similar to what it was last year. So again, I don't think there's a whole lot of distortion in our aggregate results associated with that.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, okay, great. And then lastly you gave good directional guidance on the Japan issue setting into next year, so sequentially it gets easier each quarter, but I guess on a net overall basis it\u2019s still a nicely positive tailwind to earnings in the aggregate next year, is that correct?", "Bret W. Wise", "Well, I would say you know keep in mind, I think once your anniversary kind of the impact, so once you kind of get through the first half of the year, then I think that you can assume that that should be begin to be more accretive year-over-year. But in the first half, despite the potential sequential improvements in the first and second Q, year-over-year those periods will probably still be negative. So you\u2019re not going to get the benefit until probably the third and fourth Q and for the year, you might get absolutely some slight positive.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Sorry.", "Christopher T. Clark", "", "Recognize of the event was March 11, so it really didn\u2019t impact Q1 and we certainly had inventories coming into Q2. So while we had an impact that impact was really leader in the quarter.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, so a modest benefit to 2012. It seems more fair and then you\u2019d anniversary this \u2013 annualize this benefits in 2013 as it all goes according to plan.", "Bret W. Wise", "Yeah, I think that that\u2019s fair and as we get into the back half of 2012, I think that\u2019s also fair that we should be seeing some improvements.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Hi, good morning.", "Bret W. Wise", "Good morning.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Bret, just quickly on the US trends, I mean is that your sense that the strength in the US, I mean was attributable to any type of better utilization trends. Or is it, would you characterize it more as a function of price in some of the new product contribution?", "Bret W. Wise", "I don\u2019t think it was price, specifically. Utilization trends are hard for us to really get a hand on except in our direct businesses. I think for us it was really a strong uptake on the new products, it seemed to us that dentists were buying a little bit more aggressively than they had before. As we already commented that we did the normal price increase and we saw about the normal buy heads that wasn\u2019t bad. Our view is that, across all of these platforms things just improved in the US just got better.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Okay, thanks and then, Chris on the new product front, should we expect the same level of new product launches in the back half of this year as we saw through the first half and then, any update you have on MTM or the Sensodyne collaboration would be helpful as well.", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yeah. In terms of the overall level, if you will in terms of new product launches, we were probably front loaded this year. We commented on that this year was pretty much a heavy year for us in innovation and it was no doubt in terms of the timing of the introductions probably more front loaded than back loaded. That said, we introduced some new products in the third quarter, I didn\u2019t highlight those in my comments, but one that which I would highlight would be on the preventive business the RDH Freedom Cordless Prophy handpiece that is a significant improvement versus the coated handpiece that hygienist typically for prophies. So, I mean there is a number of new product launches still in the third and fourth quarters that we look to bring into market, but I would characterize that as more normal levels.", "In terms of MTM, I'm not going to comment specifically on timing in terms of the US launch, because again it is depending on regulatory approval and that\u2019s not something we can predict really easily. What I would say is that we are now just launching it in Canada. So obviously, we\u2019ll look at that as a test market to try to optimize our launch programs if you were moving forward.", "In terms of the Sensodyne collaboration, we\u2019re work with them on a number of fronts. I would say, that there are some areas with that, that we\u2019ve been pleased with in terms of the results and some areas that have been a bit more challenging, really not going to get into a lot more specifics in that, but I would say that, again, I think we\u2019re certainly better for the collaboration as a result.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Thanks. And then lastly, Bill any update on the CapEx or operating cash flow expectations for the year.", "William R. Jellison", "", "Well you can see that, we spent probably around $45 million so far through this period. I think that you know something probably around the $60 million maybe you know $60, a little bit north of $60 might be reasonable, but and it really depends on how those flow in, but I think that that\u2019s what you should expect for this year and you\u2019re probably going obviously see a bump in that again next year.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Bret W. Wise", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thanks, guys, just two quick follow-ups here. Bill, what was the change in the equity and affiliate client there swing into a nice positive number this quarter?", "William R. Jellison", "", "As far as the non-controlling interest portion, part of that was being backed up. As you can see on the non-GAAP related items that was a move on the deal investment that we\u2019ve got associated with it, but it\u2019s really the performance of really both of those businesses, both of the businesses that we consolidate and backout a piece of, but then also the deal operations.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay. So the 15.97 numbers that\u2019s in the P&L you did back a little bit of that out (inaudible) one of the disclosures.", "William R. Jellison", "Yeah, that\u2019s correct.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay. I\u2019ll take a look there. And then, lastly, I know a lot of discussion here on kind of how ortho might or might not pace back in over the next couple of years. But Chris, I think you made the comment you don\u2019t think about this as a multiyear recapture of some of those lost sale. Over the next two or three years as you recapture that if that kind of happens in ratable increments, 20%, 30% a year for a couple of years, two years something like that. Is it safe to assume that the margin on that business then kind of ratably have improved two or three period. I'm assuming there are some variable costs in there, but there is a lot of fixed cost and so it's kind of like a margin driver for a few years. Is that a fair assessment?", "William R. Jellison", "", "Yeah. I'd say Jeff, we may get some leverage, but recognize that we don\u2019t manufacture. So, it\u2019s not like you get leverage comments through your own manufacturing plant with that.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Yeah. I just got to think some of the overhead costs, the absorption of some of those overhead costs that you do have in that business, it just gets better and better absorbed over a two or three year period as you ramp that backup?", "William R. Jellison", "", "Yeah. Certainly, relative to absorbing an SG&A rate in particular yes, I would say less on the gross profit rate.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Yeah. That makes sense. All right, thanks guys.", "Operator", "And at this time, we have no further questions.", "Bret W. Wise", "", "Well, thank you, everyone. That concludes our conference call for today. We thank you for your interest in DENTSPLY. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Investor Relations. Good-bye.", "Operator", "That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.", "", "For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bret Wise, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "", "Bret W. Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "Okay. Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO. And also with us today are Chris Clark, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Jellison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to begin the call today with some brief overview comments regarding our performance in the third quarter and also update you on a few strategic matters. Chris Clark is then going to give you an update on our new product introductions in our pipeline. And Bill Jellison will then provide a more detailed discussion of the financial performance and the financial statements included in the release. And of course, following our formal remarks, we will be glad to answer any questions that you may have.", "", "Before we get started, it is important to note that this conference call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties, and these should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and the uncertainties described in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q, our press releases and our conference call transcripts, all of which have been filed with the SEC. This conference call in its entirety will be part of an 8-K filing that will be available on our website either later this week or early next week. So by now, each of you should have received our third quarter earnings release announcement that was released to the market after the market closed last night. If for some reason you haven't received that, it is available on our website.", "", "We're pleased to report record sales and earnings for the third quarter. Reported sales for the quarter were $488.1 million, which is a 12.0% increase compared to the 2006 quarter. Excluding precious metal content, sales were $445.3 million, which is a 12.8% increase compared to the 2006 quarter. The increase in sales ex-precious metal of 12.8% was comprised of internal organic growth of 6.0%, acquisitions added 2.9%, and foreign exchange added 3.9%. Our internal growth rate for the third quarter was led by all three of our specialty businesses which grew double-digit. Implant, once again, led the way with worldwide internal growth rate of approximately 20%. And during the third quarter we also saw continued improvement in our prosthetics or lab business particularly in the United States, building on the momentum that we had experienced in the second quarter of this year.", "", "The geographic breakdown of the internal growth in the quarter excluding precious metals was the U.S. was 3.2%, Europe was 7.2%, and the rest of the world category was 10.4%. Overall we're very pleased with what continues to be growth above that of the global dental market in most of the categories in which we compete. In the U.S., we saw a continuation of our strong growth trend in implants, building on what we had experienced really throughout this year, and orthodontics also continued with double-digit growth in the region. And of course, as I mentioned earlier, the lab business also picked up very nicely for the U.S. market.", "", "In the consumables category you will recall that late last September, September 2006, we had announced our strategic partnership with our key distributors in the United States. This partnership initiative included a significant reduction in the number of dealers in the U.S. carrying our products. To date, we remain very pleased with how the implementation has gone and although it has dampened our growth in these categories in the U.S. this year, we view it as a very important investment in the future.", "", "You may recall that at the time of the announcement last year, we allowed our discontinued dealers to both buy ahead of our October 1 price increase, and also permitted them to buy 60 days of inventory in the fourth quarter of 2006. Accordingly, we would have expected them to have had inventory to carry them through the first quarter of 2007 and possibly into the second quarter of 2007. So from our perspective, of course this means that the initiative will anniversary in the fourth quarter this year, and we believe we will begin to see acceleration of growth in this consumable category in the U.S. this quarter, meaning the fourth quarter of 2007, and then extending into 2008.", "", "In Europe, we continue to experience rapid growth, with internal growth for the quarter at 7.2%, really consistent with the very strong performance we've turned in over the entire year. Overall, we had a very strong performance in the quarter of all three of our specialty areas including implants, orthodontics and endodontics. In the rest of the world category we continue to see high demand levels for our products in most regions and experienced double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Canada, the Middle East, Australia, and mid single-digit growth in Japan.", "", "One of our key initiatives is to fully leverage the investments that we've made and the resulting strength of our global platform. We've seen results accelerate in many markets as our businesses fully leverage that platform. And in addition, we're experiencing very good results in developing markets despite having implemented stronger processes earlier this year to reduce the risk that our products could be gray marketed back into the developed markets, particularly the United States and Europe.", "", "From an earnings perspective, we generated $0.42 per diluted share in the quarter, which was up 35% on a pure GAAP reporting basis. On a non-GAAP reporting basis, which excludes tax adjustments and the restructuring and other costs lined in the income statement, we generated $0.39 per diluted share in the third quarter, compared to $0.33 last year on that same non-GAAP basis, or an 18.7% improvement year-over-year. On this same non-GAAP basis, operating margins were 19.6% in the third quarter of this year, which is virtually the same as last year. I view this positively as the recent acquisitions probably negatively impacted the overall operating margin by 20 to 30 basis points in the third quarter. We should improve on that as we integrate the acquisitions and begin to realize the sales and marketing, and of course, the cost synergies coming forth from those acquisitions. And as promised, throughout this year, we would expect to begin to see some improvement in operating margin in the fourth quarter of this year, and extending into 2008.", "", "Before covering the outlook I would like to comment just a moment on our business development activities this year. To date in 2007, we have completed five acquisitions, three in the second quarter and two this quarter. Most of these transactions were for small companies. However, they're still very meaningful to us as they provide us with cost and product synergies, new technology platforms, or sales and marketing reach which will improve our ability to fully serve the global dental market. The Sultan acquisition, of course, was a larger transaction and was completed in the third quarter. We are working very closely with the Sultan management team to maximize the market reach for Sultan and finding ways that we can improve both organizations. To date, we're very early in that process, but we have found that the transaction has very solid upside potential.", "", "In total this year, we have deployed approximately $100 million in capital for all five acquisitions and we're encouraged by the additional opportunities we see in the marketplace. You may recall that our strategy is to grow above market organically and to add three to four points of growth per year in acquisitions to achieve double-digit overall growth over the long term. And given our experience this year and a view towards the pipeline, we view that as a reasonable expectation moving forward.", "", "Looking at the remainder of this year, the outlook remains very positive for reaching our full-year objectives. You may recall that at the end of the second quarter, we raised our internal growth target range to 6% to 7% from this year, and that was up from our earlier guidance of 5% to 6%. And we also commented at that time that we expected sales towards the lower end of that range in the third quarter and the upper end in the fourth quarter. The third quarter came in very close to what our expectations were, and we can reaffirm our expectations for the full year at 6% to 7% organic growth, and we would expect to be towards the upper end of that range in the fourth quarter.", "", "Likewise, we came in a little stronger on the earnings side than we had expected in the third quarter, and are increasing our full-year earnings per share guidance to $1.62 to $1.66 per diluted share, and that's up from our earlier guidance of $1.60 to $1.64 per diluted share. And again, that is on the non-GAAP basis, excluding tax adjustments and the restructuring and other cost line item. So this reflects earnings per share growth excluding these items in the mid to high teens for the full year. And consistent with our practice, we will provide you with guidance on 2008 when we announce our full-year results for 2007, which will likely be scheduled in early February of next year.", "", "So that concludes my comments. And I would like to now turn the call over to Chris Clark for a review of our new product pipeline. Chris?", "", "Christopher T. Clark\u2020\u00f1 Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President", "", "Thank you, Bret, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call this morning. I would like to take a few moments and provide you an update of our innovation efforts and to highlight some of the recent key new product introductions. In short, we continue to be active on the innovation front and introduced five new products during the third quarter, which brings our total for the year to 26. I would like to highlight in particular a few of our recent introductions.", "", "First, at the recent American Dental Association Show last month, our endodontic business launched the GT Series X Files using the new breakthrough M-Wire technology. Now, this product incorporates intellectual property that we acquired as part of the Sportswire acquisition last quarter. And its nickel titanium rotary endodontic file that has greater resistance to cyclical fatigue and more flexibility really than traditional nickel titanium files. This unique file design improves the cutting efficiency and it simplifies the procedure for dentists. It has received a very positive reaction from the opinion leader network, and really is the next generation of nickel titanium rotary endodontic instruments.", "", "I would also like to highlight two recent new products on the consumable side of the business. Lasting Touch is a photo curable resin-based material that is used to seal and polish a composite restoration. This is really the first liquid, first real liquid polisher that provides faster and easier polishing techniques for the dentist and also delivers a glossy final restoration. We also introduced Aquasil B4, which is an adjunct to our very successful Aquasil line of impression materials. B4 is a wetting agent that the dentist uses before taking the impression that minimizes voids and bubbles and yields an even more accurate impression. This product is particularly helpful in difficult clinical cases, and provides the dentist greater comfort that their impression is accurate regardless of the complexity of the case. Customer reaction to both Lasting Touch and B4 have been extremely positive, as well.", "", "Looking ahead, we have several significant new product introductions in the pipeline, including new products for two of our businesses that arises from our relationship with Materialize Dental, and overall, we continue to be very encouraged by the progress of our innovation effort. I would now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the financial results for the quarter in more detail. Bill?", "", "William R. Jellison\u2020\u00f1 Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President", "", "Good morning, everyone. As Bret mentioned, net sales for the third quarter of 2007 increased by 12% in total, and increased by 12.8% excluding precious metals. The sales increase ex-precious metals for the quarter included a 6% increase from internal growth, 2.9% from acquisitions, and a 3.9% increase from foreign exchange translation. The geographic mix of sales ex-precious metals in the third quarter of 2007 included the U.S. at 43.4%, Europe and CIS represented 35.3% this year, and the rest of the world was 21.2% of sales.

Margin rates were impacted in the quarter by lower margins in recently completed acquisitions, and from negative purchase price variances occurring from the weakness in the dollar. These exchange rate purchase price variances for DENTSPLY typically move in the opposite direction from earnings translation movements, and it is also why we are typically impacted more on the top line than we are on the bottom line from exchange movement.", "", "SG&A expenses were $165.7 million in the third quarter, and increased 11.6% versus prior year, reflecting the negative impact of a weak dollar and expenses associated with recent acquisitions.

We expect this leverage improvement to continue in the fourth quarter as we continue to benefit from our improving sales. Operating margins for the quarter were 16.9% compared to 18% in the third quarter of last year, and operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals were 18.5% compared to 19.9% last year in the same period.

This adjustment resulted primarily from the deferred tax impact of a German tax rate change which becomes effective January 1st, 2008. This change reduces Germany's overall corporate tax rate to roughly 30% from approximately 39% currently.

The first quarter of 2006, however, included $23 million of cash outflow for the tax payment associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings made in the fourth quarter of 2005.

Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "Well, Brandon, good morning, and that's a good question. And there has been a lot of dialogue about this recently, particularly as it relates to the implant market. I think if you look at dentistry, it is not immune to economic conditions, although it is somewhat resistant to economic conditions. And so for most of our products, they might move slightly with the economy, but not a lot. In the very specialized area, meaning the highly esthetic products, or perhaps implants, which has been the focus of a lot of discussion recently in this area, those are expensive procedures. Many times they're not reimbursed, so they come out of your discretionary income. And I would think that they would be somewhat subject to economic swings, or more subject than perhaps our consumable category.", "", "We haven't seen a big impact so far from the dialogue about the potential for a recession in the United States, for instance, on our implant business. And in fact, our implant business in the United States is growing rapidly. But again, we're probably not the best proxy to measure that because we have a small implant business here with a lot of sales and marketing resources, so we would expect it to grow above market. So I think there is an element of that, but I don't think it is an overriding consideration, particularly for a business like ours that is very diverse with respect to product categories, and very diverse with respect to geographic regions. So we typically, when we see one product or one category under perform or one region under perform, we generally have another region than outperforms and counteracts it.", "", "Brandon Coolyerd \u00f1 Banc of America Securities", "", "Great.

Most notably, all of the consumable categories in the United States that go through distribution. We raise those prices October 1 annually, and we just last year got all the businesses to October 1, so that we can have a consistent trend year-over-year.

And then a question on your U.S. trends, it sounds to me like you believe you're still being impacted by some of the changes you made last year in the distribution program.

In short, given the fact that we discontinued dealers, over 200 dealers, we knew we were going to have a headwind really for a good chunk of really most of the first year that we introduced. We're coming up on that anniversary, obviously, and we continue to believe that we're making significant progress in terms of converting customers to our retained distributor network. At this point, we've maintained the majority of the at-risk customers, and we're working real closely with the continuing dealers in really a level of partnership that we never had with them before.", "", "In terms of gray market, that we commented on that in particular in previous calls, and that continues to be a key issue and a key focus area for us. We're continuing to put a lot of resources against that. And I think we're making really some progress with that. The focus really on our end includes not only pricing, but also packaging, labeling and branding solutions. As well, we're working very closely to monitor particular international dealers that we have concerns about.", "", "And I mentioned on the call last quarter, three international distributors we discontinued in the second quarter. This quarter as well, we discontinued additional dealers that had been set up really to supply Israel, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, that in fact, we were concerned were engaging in gray market activities far beyond those countries.

Just wondered if you could update us, Bret, maybe on the training level or the cross-training level, if you will, of the orthodontic and implant, endodontic, I\u00edm sorry and implant guys? I think we were close to 70% as of your analyst meeting. Is that still moving up? And is that, was dental implant growth this quarter in the U.S. again approaching that 20% or north of that 20% number we saw in the Q2?", "", "Bret W. Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "Sure, I will give you an update on that. And for those that aren't completely familiar with this, at the beginning of this year, we merged our implant and endodontics sales forces in the U.S. to bring forth to the market kind of a value package that allowed us to serve what we call the full life cycle of the tooth out of one sales bag, endodontically treating a tooth or doing an implant when it is required. It encompassed a significant training effort and investment of funds to bring the endodontic sales force up to the level of training necessary to do implant sales, and likewise, to bring the implant sales force up to the level of training necessary to do endodontic sales, which is rotary endodontics, it is kind of like surgery. That progress has gone very well.", "", "As you mentioned, in mid September we were at 70% proficiency. It has ticked up a bit since then. And we're getting to the point where we need some very specific training for some specific folks, but not nearly the broad-based training that we had to encompass this year. So I think it has gone very well. Implant growth in the U.S. was over 20% in the quarter again, which we view as favorable given some of the benchmarks we get from other implant companies in this market. And again, we view that initiative very positively, and on track to accomplish the objectives that we set forth about a year ago when we implemented it.", "", "Jeff Johnson \u00f1 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "Great. And then as we look into the fourth quarter, Bret, obviously a lot of moving parts with the anniversary of the distributor reorg, as you talked about. But with moving all of the price increases to October 1, and so presumably a little bit bigger maybe buy-in this year at the end of Q3 as opposed to prior years, just want to make sure I am hearing you correctly, that Q4 we should see a tick-up in organic growth in the U.S.?", "", "Bret W. Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "Yes. And the movement of the price increases was actually last year. Last year, we moved the last large division to October 1. And we did it at the same time we implemented that strategic partnership with our key dealers in the U.S. So we had our key dealers buying ahead of that price increase last year and the discontinued dealers buying ahead of that price increase last year. And I think the message I wanted to send this morning was that it will anniversary in the fourth quarter, so in the fourth quarter last year, the discontinued dealers could only buy two months of inventory. So we should begin to see an up tick in internal growth coming from a comparison issue there, as well as our better execution on the partnership with our dealers this year. But the price increase issue was the same year-over-year this year. They were October 1 last year and they are October 1 this year.", "", "Jeff Johnson \u00f1 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "Okay. Great. My misunderstanding, thanks for the clarity. And Bill, I guess last couple of questions for you. FY08 tax rate then, you alluded to it, should we be thinking 50 basis point, 100 basis point year-over-year decline in FY08? Is that fair? Or is that going to be too big?", "", "William R. Jellison\u2020\u00f1 Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President", "", "We haven't given any kind of outlook on that tax rate at this point, Jeff. And I think from, we are absolutely targeting to continue to make some improvements in that area, both because of the German situation, as well as because of the global project that we're working on internally. I think we will talk more specifically on that when we really give guidance for next year.", "", "Jeff Johnson \u00f1 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "Fair enough.

Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "Okay. Fair enough. And again, not trying to go at FY08 guidance here, I'm trying to without going directly at it anyway, I guess. The deals you've done, five deals thus far, the corporate goals you guys talk about at 5% to 6% internal growth, 4% to 5% acquisition growth, and then EPS growth maybe a couple of points above that, have those five deals that have been done this year, are they sizable enough to kind of get you into that corporate goal range, if you will?", "", "Bret W. Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "Well, I think the five transactions we did this year were meaningful and important to us, and as I mentioned, they grew, they contributed about 3% growth to the third quarter. So that can accelerate a little bit going forward, because at least one of those technologies, one of those acquisitions was a pure technology play. And so we would expect it to start to contribute going forward.", "", "But I think what I would emphasize is we believe we can get to those goals, but we're not done yet. We're continuing to work on this. We would expect more acquisition activity, both, perhaps this year. It is hard to nail the timing down to just a couple of months left in the year. But going into 2008, we would expect more acquisition growth, and we're encouraged by both what we see in the marketplace and our ability to execute on it. So we view that goal as a reasonable expectation at this point.", "", "Jeff Johnson \u00f1 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "All right. That's all I've got, guys. Thanks much.", "", "Operator", "", "Our next question will come from Anthony Ostrea with JMP Securities.", "", "Anthony Ostrea \u00f1 JMP Securities", "", "Hi good morning guys.", "", "Unidentified Company Representatives", "", "Good morning Anthony.", "", "Anthony Ostrea \u00f1 JMP Securities", "", "Maybe just piggybacking on the acquisition kind of pipeline question earlier, Bret, it seems like, at least for this quarter, or this conference call, you sound a little more forceful or optimistic about being able to secure, or to do much more deals than the past. Maybe can you qualify those comments, maybe give us more color on how big that pipeline is right now, maybe either in terms of the number of companies you're looking at, dollar amount, or timing perhaps?", "", "Bret W. Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "That's always hard to do. And I would really rather not do that. What I would say at this point is that we added resources to our business development group at the beginning of this year. And throughout this year, we've been much more focused on networking and targeting companies that we think would contribute to our growth, our global reach, our technology base, et cetera. And we've been encouraged by the number of companies that make it through that screen. Executing on transactions, of course, always requires a lot of investment in time. You got to make sure the culture of the two companies are right, and that the synergy expectations are reasonable. And I guess my message today was that now having spent 9, 10 months on this area, after having put more resources towards this area of our business, we're encouraged by what we see. So we would expect that we would continue to be acquisitive going forward. At the investor meeting in mid September in New York, we stated that our target is to reinvest about 75% of our cash flow in growth, which of course includes acquisitions as a major component of that. And so that is our target. And we think it is a reasonable expectation.", "", "Anthony Ostrea \u00f1 JMP Securities", "", "Okay. And then maybe, Bill, in terms of acquisitions and impact on margin, I know you said, or maybe it was Bret, it was a 20 to 30 basis point impact this quarter. When might we see, at what point, which quarter, might we see the impact of those acquisitions becoming neutral, so to speak?", "", "William R. Jellison\u2020\u00f1 Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President", "", "Well, first off, Anthony, the impact from the acquisitions is totally dependent upon the type of acquisition that it is, the business that it is in, and also what kind of margin levels that it is at. Keep in mind, for example, when we acquired Sultan Healthcare, which was obviously the largest acquisition that we did this year, we stated that about two-thirds of the products that they currently, that they currently sell are actually manufactured outside of Sultan. And so obviously, we would expect, and you should expect, that the margins on that business would be less than they would be on average for DENTSPLY. That does not mean that other typical acquisitions that we would be doing, may be not only at, but may be above the overall margin rates that we have for an organization. And I think on average we would expect that acquisitions, other than in the first probably quarter of when inventory step-up would occur, would typically be not only accretive for us moving forward, but should at least be at kind of the same margin rate levels that we have as an organization.", "", "Bret W. Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "I would expand on that, Anthony, just by saying it takes a while to get the synergies, both in terms of growing the acquired business, and finding the ways that you can share resources to make both businesses stronger. It takes a while. So we're still at the infancy of that. And as we noted in our comments earlier, we would expect operating margin expansion for the whole business to start in the fourth quarter.", "", "Anthony Ostrea \u00f1 JMP Securities", "", "Okay. And maybe just, Bill, you mentioned that say for Sultan, two-thirds of products are being manufactured outside of Sultan. Are there plans, I guess right now, to bring that in-house?", "", "Bret W. Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "This is Bret, actually. We, in the dental industry, we find in many instances that outsourcing production is actually a favorable strategy. It is a useful strategy, particularly if the equipment, the installed base of the equipments are already there. So there may be occasions where we want to in source some of that manufacturing, but I would not characterize that as a main strategic element to use when we integrate Sultan. I think their supplier base is a very good supplier base, and they've served the Company well, and we would expect that that would largely continue.", "", "Anthony Ostrea \u00f1 JMP Securities", "", "And two last questions. One on FX. If I heard you correctly, Bill, I think you said that in fact, the FX in the quarter on margins was minimal, I believe. Can you just clarify that, if I had that correctly? And in a, if rates actually turn against you on the top line, can you comment on the impact of FX on margins?", "", "William R. Jellison\u2020\u00f1 Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President", "", "Sure. The comment that I made there, Anthony, was really that FX, obviously we get full impact of FX translation on the top line. But we've typically stated in the past, as well, too, that we don't get that same level of impact on the bottom side, because we've got more natural hedges in the business as far as where we're producing products, and how that is going back and forth.", "", "So in this case, as the dollar, while the dollar is weak, we actually get favorable translation side benefiting us. But on the operating margin side, we are actually purchasing in a few additional products, especially from the European market out of our Swiss locations and German locations that actually have a negative impact as far as FX is concerned, through our purchase price variances in our gross margin areas. But right now, netting both the translation and of the impact from the PPV side of the equation off, we're still getting a slightly favorable bottom line impact from FX today.", "", "Anthony Ostrea \u00f1 JMP Securities", "", "Okay. And the last question, just on your specialty products, I think you broke out ortho and implants in the U.S. Can you maybe just comment on endo in the U.S.?", "", "Bret W. Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "Sure. Endo, I would characterize as a more mature market in the U.S. compared to the implants and orthodontics.

It was a small acquisition of an implant distribution business in Europe. So we didn't comment on it because it was a small transaction, a small company, but still important to the area, the region of Europe that we were targeting. So that was the nature of it.

I think that we'll be a little bit stronger on a run rate in the fourth quarter than we were for the first 3 months. Our expectation is that we will be somewhere in probably the, approximately the $60 million range in total for this year.

We also obviously take into account things that are taking place inside of the organization, and also kind of where our acquisition pipeline is. As I mentioned, we've got about 2.5 million shares still available under our authorization level.

I think from a perspective of looking at whether we would be doing buybacks along with some of our other activities on the acquisition front, I would say that if we're kind of at or below kind of that 25%-ish debt to cap level, more than likely you will see us be doing both of those activities and not restricting ourselves to one. I would say as we're north of the 25% debt to cap level, there would be additional evaluations taking a look at based on how full our pipeline of acquisitions are.", "", "Bret W.

I think what we've said is that we want to be a strong investment grade credit. We kind of think of that as a triple B plus credit. We've also said kind of 35 to 40 debt to cap is a comfortable area for us. And we would like to keep our, some of our ratios of, leverage ratio at two or below two, if possible.

Most of those investments, you need to understand, are in people and resources to support those businesses, so those are kind of ongoing investments. They won't go away. Although with what we said is, we think we will grow into those investments and thus, we will begin to see margin expansion late this year. We have been pretty consistent about that, and now I think we should see margin expansion in FY08, as well. So we're kind of staying with out target, 30 to 50 basis points per year. We think that is a good target for us and we can accomplish that. We haven't done that so far this year. But we've been pretty forthright that it was due to those same investments you alluded to in your question. And I think going forward; we would now expect to see margin expansion again, start to occur beginning in the fourth quarter this year, and moving on into FY08.

Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "Yes, I don't think you will see it go down, but it may not grow as fast as it has in the past. And thus, we will get more leverage out of that line in the income statement.", "", "Derek Leckow \u00f1 Barrington Research", "", "Okay. Great. And my last question, on the orthodontics business. You are still growing double-digits here, even despite a seasonally weaker period. And I'm wondering is this because the self-ligating brackets are now becoming a standard of care? Or are you still seeing that as a premium technology that people trade up to? What is the status of self-ligation out in the marketplace?", "", "Christopher T. Clark\u2020\u00f1 Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President", "", "Yes Derek, it is Chris. We continue to see the self-ligating category grow and we continue to gain market share in that category. And obviously as we have chatted previously, it is a significant premium price. Our Innovation C product, in particular, which is the all ceramic self-ligating bracket, continues to have very strong demand, and that is really one of the key drivers in terms of the business results we're seeing.", "", "Derek Leckow \u00f1 Barrington Research", "", "And what level of penetration would you estimate that you're currently at with that product?", "", "Christopher T. Clark\u2020\u00f1 Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President", "", "Oh, I think we've got a long way to go yet, to be quite frank. Again, self-ligating is the minority in terms of the units in the market. And we've had a very good introduction, and we're getting not only upgrade, if you will, from traditional bracket cases, but also gaining more competitive market share. But yes, we're early in the game on this one. I think we've got, this will continue to be a growth area for us, a growth product for us as we look to 2008 and beyond.", "", "Derek Leckow \u00f1 Barrington Research", "", "The trade-off for the end user is a third less time in terms of treatment time, but probably 50% higher cost. Is that how I should think about that or--?", "", "Bret W. Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "Yes, this is Bret. I think for the patient and the orthodontist, of course, you get accelerated treatment time by about a third with self-ligation. You're right about that. And we have been able to do that for some time using an all metal bracket. The real key to Innovation C is that it is a highly esthetic bracket, so the patients love it. It still gives the clinician, it doesn't sacrifice function or speed of treatment, so the clinician gets what they want, and it has had very great acceptance in the marketplace. The opinion leaders like it, the docs like it, and the patients like it. So as Chris said, we think it has a long way to run.", "", "Derek Leckow \u00f1 Barrington Research", "", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "", "Bret W. Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "", "And you have a follow up question with Brandon from Banc of America Securities.", "", "Brandon Coolyerd \u00f1 Banc of America", "", "Thanks for taking my question. A conceptual one, I guess, on amalgam. Should we be focused on this issue as a potential driver for the Company, and do you perceive any upcoming legislative events or otherwise that may catalyze a transition from amalgam to composites in your restorative product line?", "", "Bret W. Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "That's a very good question. And we've seen a slow trend of conversion of amalgam restorations to all composite restorations, really for a number of years. Occasionally, meaning every couple of years, it seems to, there seems to be something raise its head that challenges whether we should be using amalgam as an industry because of the, there is a mercury content within amalgam, but it is encapsulated in the amalgam. Nevertheless, amalgam is still a very good product. My back teeth are full of them, and they've been there for 35 years, and they're still functioning great. And we believe amalgam will be around for some time. Although this slow but constant conversion to composites should probably continue and that is an opportunity for us because our revenue generation per filling, per se, if you will, is much higher with the composite than it is with an amalgam. So I think that will aid the industry and aid us. But it is going to be a slow and consistent conversion, not a, I don't see it being a one-time event where amalgams just go away.", "", "Brandon Coolyerd \u00f1 Banc of America", "", "Thanks.", "", "Bret W. Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "", "It appears we have no further questions at this time. But I would like to give the audience one additional opportunity. [Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Wise, I would like to turn the conference back over to you for closing remarks.", "", "Bret W. Wise\u2020\u00f1 Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "", "Okay. Thank you, Regina. And again, thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our third quarter report. We feel really good about our performance through the first three quarters of 2007. And we also feel like we're making good progress on our long term strategic initiatives. Thank you again for your time this morning.

Baird", "Anthony Ostrea - JMP Securities", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the DENTSPLY International\u2019s 2007 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bret Wise, the Chairman, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Hi. Good morning, and thank you everyone for joining us on our fourth quarter and full-year earnings call. This is Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO, and also with us today are Chris Clark, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Jellison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "I'd like to begin the call today with a few overview comments on our results and a few strategic items. Chris Clark will then provide some insight on certain operational items that are of focus, and Bill Jellison will then provide some detailed insights on our financial results, both for the quarter and the year. And then of course, following our remarks we will be glad to answer any questions that you may have.", "Before we get started, its important to note that this conference call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties, and these should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and the uncertainties described in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, our periodic reports on Form 10-Q, our press releases, and our conference call transcripts, all of which have been filed with the SEC. And this conference call in its entirety will be part of an 8-K filing latter this week, which will be available on our website.", "So last night, we were very pleased to report record sales and earnings for both the fourth quarter and the full-year 2007. Our reported sales for the quarter were $541.5 million, which is an increase of 14.9% compared to the 2006 quarter. Excluding precious metal content, sales were $489.2 million, which is a 16.1% increase for the quarter, and that represents the fastest quarterly expansion we\u2019ve experienced since the third quarter of 2002. Growth in the quarter, again ex-precious metals, was driven by 7.1% internal growth, 3.3% acquisition growth, to arrive at a constant currency growth of about 10.4% in total. And then on top of that, we added approximately a 5.8% pickup in currency.", "On a geographic basis, internal growth accelerated in the US to 5.5% and total constant currency growth in the US was 11.6%, obviously aided by the acquisitions that we completed in the second half in 2007. Internal growth in Europe was 6.1%, and that's a continuing a very strong trend we have seen all year, and internal growth for the rest to world was a phenomenal 12.2% led by Canada, Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, all of which grew double digits, and Japan, which grew high single digits. So we believe in each of those regions we are certainly growing well in excess of the market.", "I think a few observations I\u2019d make on the growth for the fourth quarter, first thing that I think the results show that the investments that we have been making throughout the year have paid off with accelerated growth. As we enter 2007, you may recall we had committed to additional investments in sales and marketing including expanding our sales force in certain key regions and product categories, investments in improved data systems for selling in our direct marketing efforts, investments in structuring key businesses and distribution channels differently to accelerate growth, and also investments\u2026 expanded investments in clinical education and [inaudible] support for many of our businesses. So these investments certainly helped deliver accelerated growth in 2007, and we believe they served to improve our key growth platforms as we move into 2008. So obviously we are very pleased with those returns.", "The second point I\u2019d make is that DENTSPLY has a very strong international platform of businesses. Our sales outside the US comprise 60% of our mix, and we are really depended on any one economy or even region for our growth and performance. So 2007 was a good example of this where we are making investments to accelerate growth in the future, particularly in the US, and we had [inaudible] growth in the US. We were able to outperform several of our other regions to deliver what we believe are very good results overall during the period\u2026 this period we are making the investments in the US. So I think that\u2019s the testament to a strong balance we have in our business and position us well for the future, even with uncertain economic prospects at this point.", "Earnings in fourth quarter were $0.45 per share on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring charges and tax adjustments, diluted earnings were $0.44 a share in 2006 versus $0.37 on that same basis in the... excuse me, $0.44 a share in 2007 versus $0.37 on that same basis in the 2006 quarter. So that's an increase of 18.9% year-over-year. Fourth quarter earnings were obviously driven by strong sales growth, but also a four percentage points or 100 basis points improvement in our operating margins in the quarter excluding restructuring charges.", "So just a few comments on the full year results for 2007. During 2007, in total we saw our growth accelerate to 11% and we crossed the $2 billion mark in sales for the first time, which is an important milestone, and it occurred just six years after we first achieved the $1 billion sales in 2001. Excluding precious metal content, sales growth for the year was 12.1%. That's making it our strongest growth since 2002. And you might recall, in 2002 we benefited from four very sizable acquisitions that were completed in the last half of 2001. Full-year growth ex-precious metal was driven by internal growth of 6.4% for the year. Acquisition growth added 1.6% for the full year and currency added 4.1%.", "The regional internal growth for the full year was 4.2% in the US, 7.3% in Europe, and 9.4% for the rest of the world. So certainly, growth recorded in Europe and rest of world categories for the full year were well above market. In the US as you know, growth was muted somewhat by the implementation of our strategic partnership with our dealers. In the fourth quarter, we began to see faster growth in the US, which is rewarding, ad that initiative with our dealers has now anniversaried and is not a drag on our internal growth in the region.", "Internal growth for the full year was led by our specialty businesses, which grew double digits on a worldwide basis in aggregate. And on a single franchise basis implants grew 20% for the full year on an internal growth basis and close to 30% including acquisitions and currency. Earnings for the full year were $1.68 on a GAAP reported basis, and again excluding tax adjustments and restructuring charges, which is non-GAAP, it was $1.66 per share, a 16.9% improvement over all of 2006. I think it' s important to note that complementing this performance was really extraordinary operating cash flow generation, which on a preliminary basis grew to approximately $390 million this year, which is 40% improvement over the prior year. And that was aided by improvements in inventory and receivables days, particularly in the fourth quarter, and also lower tax payment this year.", "So overall, we are very encouraged by our accelerated internal growth, the operating margin improvement that we generated in the fourth quarter, which actually allowed us to show an improvement on operating margins for the full year, and again our record cash flow for the full-year 2007.", "Looking forward to 2008, we are very cognizant of the uncertain economic situation we have, particularly in the US. As we said in the past, dentistry is not immune to a slowing or contracting economic environment, but it's much more resistant than most industries. In addition, I would say that unlike some industries, a slowing environment in one region of the world is not really likely to impact the other regions in a meaningful way. We believe we're uniquely positioned to continue to perform well even in a slowing US economy. We have a product mix that is very focused on dental consumables, a balanced geographic mix, and a very effective global sales force. So at this time, we believe the slower economy should only have a limited impact on the performance in 2008. And I think we get comfort from the results we had in 2007, where we had slower growth in US, but it was much\u2026 was more than concentrated by strong growth in Europe and the rest of world.", "So accordingly, we look to have a another strong performance in 2008. Overall for the year, we believe that internal growth will be in the 5.5% to 6.5% range and assuming current exchange rates hold for the year and adding our acquisition growth for transactions we have already completed in 2007, we would expect total growth for the year to be at or close to double-digits. On a diluted earnings per share basis, we would expect full-year 2008 earnings to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.88, and again that would exclude restructuring charges or one-time tax adjustments.", "So that concludes my prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Clark, our Chief Operating Officer, who is going to discuss our performance in a couple of key product areas. Chris?", "Christopher T. Clark - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you, Bret, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call this morning. I would like to take a few moments and comment on a few of our operations that have been the focus of some key growth investments during the year. In particular, I'm going to comment on the global implant business as well as some of our country specific selling organizations.", "Starting with implants, we continue to be very pleased with our global implant performance. Total worldwide growth during 2007 was almost 30%, driven by organic growth of 20%, which was above the underlying segment growth for dental implants. Our growth was strong in virtually all regions of the world. Our ANKYLOS product line with its platform shift design continues to be very well received in the market and it's really helping to drive our strong implant growth. We were particularly excited about the results of two key implant growth initiatives that we executed during 2007.", "First, as you know, last January we merged our North American endodontic and implant businesses together, significantly expanding our sales and marketing resources to address the North American implant market. This market has been an area where we... this is an area where we\u2019ve historically been underrepresented from a market share perspective. This is a large undertaking, had a significant amount of ongoing training for the sales force throughout the year. Looking back on the initiatives now one year later, we are pleased as we\u2019ve proven our capability to grow the North American implant business in excess of underlying market growth, and we have certainly gained market share in the process.", "Second, during 2007 we launched the unique tissue care positioning of our ANKYLOS product line in Europe. This emphasizes the clinical and esthetic benefits of our platforms shift product design. We conducted five dental symposiums in Europe in late Q3 and also in Q4, and these had very positive customer reactions and very strong resultant orders. We have filed for FDA approval for the key tissue care claims in the US and we hope to expand the tissue care positioning to include the US later in 2008.", "In total, we are very pleased with the performance of our implant businesses and the progress we are making in North America with a combination of our endodontic and implant sales forces.", "I would also like to comment briefly on the performance of the few key countries and regions that have also represented growth platforms and key investment opportunities for us. In Japan, we\u2019ve clearly gained market share in 2007 with organic growth in the mid-single digits. This is well in excess of the growth rates of the underlying Japanese dental market. In China and in India, we are also seeing strong growth in the 30% to 40% range, in excess of what we believe the underlying market to be growing, as we further expand our sales representation in those countries. These are key strategic regions for us. They have increasingly large middle-class segments that are both interested in and can afford dental care that provide both improved function and esthetics. We are also particularly pleased with our growth in Russia, other CIS countries, and in the Middle East, as we believe our sales force expansion in these regions is also fueling growth that's above the underlying market rate. We are continuing to invest in these businesses as well, and we will continue to add sales reps throughout the region.", "We are encouraged by the result of these businesses and the impact of our targeted growth investments. We are going to continue to focus investments spending on higher growth markets and segments, including the areas I have described this morning. As we noted, our rest of the world region including the areas I just mentioned, grew organically 12.2% in the fourth quarter and close to 10% for the year. As these region now comprise 20% of our mix, they are growing in important to us and reducing somewhat our dependence on the growth in any one market in the developed regions such as the US.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the financial results for the quarter and the year in more detail. Bill?", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. As Bret mentioned, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased by 14.9% and sales excluding precious metals increased 16.1% in the quarter, with 7.1% coming for\u2026 from internal growth in the period. Net sales for the full year were $2.01 billion, an increase of 11% over last year, while sales ex-precious metals were $1.82 billion, an increase of 12.1% for the year.", "The 2007 geographic mix of sales ex-precious metals was as follows. The US represented 41% of sales. Europe, CIS was 39% this year, and the rest of the world is 20% of sales. Orthodontics and endodontics had internal growth rate of over 10% for the year and our implant sales grew over 20% for the full year.", "Gross margins for the fourth quarter were 55.8%, that\u2019s ex-precious metals, or lower by 1.4 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. This drop resulted from the impact of reason acquisitions, foreign exchange transactions, and our push to reduce inventories in the quarter, which resulted in lower overhead absorption in the period. Full-year gross margins were 57.2% ex-precious metals, flat compare to last year. Recent acquisition and foreign exchange impacts offset improvement made in the year. In 2008, we are expecting that operational improvements and product line mix will slightly more than offset those negative impacts.", "SG&A expenses were $173.5 million or 35.5%, sales ex-precious metals, in the fourth quarter of 2007 versus 37.9% in the fourth quarter of 2006. Total-year SG&A was $675.4 million or 37.1% of sales, ex-precious metals, in 2007 versus 37.4% in 2006 as we leveraged some of the recent investments we made at the end of 2006 and the first part of 2007.", "Operating margins were 18%, including restructuring expense, in the fourth quarter of 2007. Operating margins were 20% on sales ex-precious metals in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 18.9% in the same period last year including restructuring and impartment charges. Operating margins ex-precious metals on a non-GAAP basis, excluding impartment and restructuring charges in both periods, were 20.3% for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 19.3% in the fourth quarter last year, a 100 basis points improvement. Full-year operating margins were 19.5% on sales ex-precious metals in 2007 and 19.4% in 2006. Operating margins on sales ex-precious metals on a non-GAAP basis, excluding impairment and restructuring charges in both periods, were 20.1% in 2007 compared to 19.9% last year, an increase of 20 basis points in 2007. This improvement included the negative mix impact of our recent acquisitions. Our targeted level of improvement in operating margins on average over the next few years is 30 basis points to 50 basis points per year. This improvement is expected to come from new products, improved product mix, operating efficiencies, and leveraging of overhead costs.", "Net interest and other expense in the fourth quarter was $0.4 million, or $0.2 million lower than last year's fourth quarter. Interest expense was $0.7 million higher in the quarter than last year, while foreign exchange transaction and other expenses were $0.3 million lower in the quarter than last year.", "Net interest and other income for the full year was $3.2 million, which was an improvement of $3.2 million compared to 2006. Net interest income was $2.6 million in 2007 compared to interest income of $1.6 million in 2006. The impact of foreign exchange transactions and other items was income of $0.6 million in 2007 versus a 1$.7 million expense last year. We expect net interest expense will run approximately $0.1 per share per quarter higher in 2008 as interest expense... or interest income is negatively impacted by lower rates and current European interest rates are now higher than those in the US negatively impacting our investment hedges.", "The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28% compared to 17.9% in the fourth quarter of 2006. However, the operational tax rates in these periods were 30.7% in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 29.2% in the fourth quarter of 2006. The full-year tax rate in 2007 was 27.5% compared to 28.9% in 2006, and the 2007 tax rate of 27.5% included an operational rate of 30.4% compared to 30.6% in 2006. The company benefited from various tax adjustments of $9.9 million in 2007 compared to $4.8 million of favorable adjustments in 2006. The favorable tax-related adjustments in 2007 resulted primarily from the deferred tax impact of a German tax rate change, which became effective January 1, 2008. This change reduces Germany's overall corporate tax rate to roughly 30% effective January 1, 2008 from approximately 39% in 2007 and prior. We are expecting a future operating tax benefit, beginning in 2008, from both this change and a global business project currently underway. The operational rate for 2008, which is currently\u2026 expected to be at least 100 basis points to 150 basis points lower than the operational rate in 2007.", "To better understand and follow some of the following comments, you can look at the tables included in our recent press release. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $70 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to $64.9 million or $0.42 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2007 includes the net of tax impact of structuring and other related items of $1 million, which is $0.01 per diluted share. The fourth quarter of 2007 also includes a net reduction to income tax expense of $2.5 million or $0.02 per diluted share from tax-related adjustments, while the fourth quarter of 2006 included a net of tax impact of $1 million or $0.01 per diluted share for restructuring and other related items and a net reduction of income tax expense of $8.8 million or $0.06 per diluted share related to those tax adjustments.", "On an adjusted basis, earnings excluding restructuring and other related items and tax adjustments in both periods, which constitute a non-GAAP measure were $68.5 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $57.1 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006, an 18.9% increase in diluted earnings per share.", "Net income for 2007 was $259.7 million or $1.68 per diluted share. The 2007 earnings included the following items; restructuring and other related items of $10.5 million, which is $6.7 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share; net reduction of income tax expense of $9.9 million or $0.06 per diluted share related to tax related adjustments. Net income for 2006 was $223.7 million or $1.41 per diluted share, and the 2007 earnings included the following items; restructuring and other related items of $7.8 million, which is $5 million after-tax or $0.03 per diluted share; and net reduction of income tax expense of $4.8 million, which is $0.03 per diluted related to tax-related adjustments.", "Net income for comparability analysis excluding the other items noted upon for the years ending 2007 and 2006, which constitute the non-GAAP measure were $256.4 million and $224 million respectively. This represents earnings of $1.66 per diluted share for 2007 compared to $1.42 in 2006, an increase of 17.1%.", "Now, let's look into cash flow and a few balance sheet items. Operating cash flow ended strong with $133 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2007. Operating cash flows for the year were approximately $390 million compared to $272 million in 2006, or an increase of 43%. The first quarter of 2006 however included $23 million of cash outflow for the tax payment associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings, which was made in the fourth quarter of 2005. Adjusting for this in cash flow in 2006, operating cash flow would've increased by 32% during 2007. We expect strong cash flow again in 2008. However, we expect to have higher tax outflows this year than in 2007.", "Capital expenditures were $64 million for the year, yielding free cash flow, operating cash flow less capital expenditures and dividends, of about $301 million for the year. Depreciation and amortization for the year was $50.3 million. And capital expenditures in 2008 are projected to be in the $70 million to $80 million range, with depreciation and amortization of approximately $55 million to $60 million.", "Inventory days ended the year at 95 days for 2007 year-end, or a one-day improvement from 2006, but 11 days lower than at the end of the third quarter of 2007. Receivable days ended 2007 at 51 days compared to 60 days at the end of the third quarter of 2007 and 56 days at the end of last year. So we've made some excellent improvements in a number of working capital categories this year. We are very proud of our progress, and we've\u2026 made in reducing our working capital and also of the strong cash flow results for 2007.", "The balance sheet remains very healthy at the end of 2007. The year ended with $316 million in cash and short-term investments compared to $65 million at the end of 2006. Total debt was $483 million at the end of 2007 compared to $370 million at the end of 2006, reflecting our acquisitions and stock repurchases during 2007.", "DENTSPLY repurchased 3.4 million shares for $125.4 million at an average price of $37 per share in 2007. Based on the company's authorization to maintain up to 14 million shares of treasury stock, we still have approximately 1.9 million shares available for repurchase.", "And as Bret stated, we are comfortable with internal growth expectations for 2008 of 5.5% to 6.5%, with total sales growth approaching or exceeding 10% for the full year. We anticipate earnings for 2008 to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.88 per diluted share.", "And that concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator instructions]. and will go first to, [inaudible]", "Steven Postal - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks a lot. Good morning, and congratulation on a great year.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Good morning, Steve.", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Steven.", "Steven Postal - Lehman Brothers", "Can we just start with the economy since that seems to be a focus of a lot of people? Could you maybe discuss how economic conditions impact the business in the US and how you think that compares to Europe, and then drilling down there, what you\u2019re seeing in both those regions and if you\u2019re seeing any particular business in the US that's having an\u2026 that\u2019s seeing an impact on the changes in the economy?", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Okay, Steven. This is Bret. I'll take a stab at that. I think as we said before, just as the general premise, dentistry is more resistant to economic downturns than most industries. In the\u2026 it differs in different regions because the reimbursement comes from different places. But in the US for instance our reimbursement comes from our job\u2026 our insurance comes from our job. So if we have job loss in the US, there could be a slight downturn in the ability to pay for dental procedures and that could have an impact.", "I\u2019d say, as you look at the portfolio, our portfolio, it's a very balanced portfolio between lab products, general consumables, and than the specialty items. Certainly, I would expect that the specialty items excluding endo are the most vulnerable, and that\u2019s because implants and orthodontics are more discretionary than for instance an endo procedure where there is pain relief involved or even general dental procedures where you need a restoration of some sort. Certainly, what we have seen in the marketplace is that the implant market has slowed. We know that because the vast majority of the market is represented by public companies and they disclose their growth rates. So as we look at the US market, we know that it has probably slowed from the upper teens to the lower teens or maybe... we still think it's growing double digit. Our growth is faster than that, but as we've said before, we think that's because of the amount of resources being applied to a business with very small market share.", "In orthodontics, because it\u2019s discretionary, it can be deferred that\u2019s also\u2026 and it\u2019s expensive. That's also an area where you could see a slowing of case starts for instance if we hit tough economic times. So those are the two that I would expect to be most impacted.", "In Europe on the other hand, reimbursement most often comes from the government or there is no reimbursement at all, for instance in Italy. And our experience has been that rather than economic changes it's government reimbursement changes that drive the dental markets in those parts of the world.", "So at this point, as we look at our portfolio\u2026 and we have gone back and looked at the last several recessions to see what happened in those recessions, we would expect there to be some modest impact on growth, perhaps more on the specialties than in the general dental areas, from economic recessions, but we wouldn't expected it to be dramatic and past history has demonstrated that as well.", "Steven Postal - Lehman Brothers", "Bret, that was very helpful. Can you guys just go into, to the extent you can or want to, your exposure in specialty implants and then specifically in US implants?", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Sure. Our exposure in specialty and\u2026 specialty is about 40% of our business. Certainly, the biggest part of that\u2026 of the three segments within specialty, which are implants, orthodontics, and endodontics, endodontics is the largest segment for us. Implants and orthodontics represent between 10% and 15% of our mix and endodontics is slightly larger. So we are vulnerable to economic changes I think in those two areas. With respect to implants however, our market share is very low. So the percentage of our mix in the US in particular that's represented by implants is less than 5% of our US sales. So I think that although a slowdown in implants would have an impact on us in the US, I don't think we are highly vulnerable to that, at least at this time, and particularly in a period where we are putting a lot of resources towards that business and I believe taking market share. So we may be able to mitigate any impact from the economy just through pure muscle at this point.", "Steven Postal - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then just a question on cash flow, how should we think about working capital trends in 2008? You went into great detail about what you've done with inventory and DSO in 2007. Could that possibly ever moderate a bit in '08?", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "Yes. This is Bill, Steven. I think that from a cash flow perspective, we feel very, very good about how we ended the year in both inventory days and also receivable days. Looking into 2008, I would say that we'd be comfortable in that kind of 50 to 55 day range, which I think is very good performance in general. We actually ended at 51 days in the year. So I don't believe that we will see day improvements necessarily in 2008, although we've got a lot of additional focus within those areas, especially in the international markets.", "From an inventory perspective, we made good improvement in the fourth quarter, but for the year last year we really only reduced it by about one day. I think we have some good expectations of some continued improvements in inventory over the next few years, and I'd probably say in the maybe two to three day per year kind of range.", "Steven Postal - Lehman Brothers", "And Bill, are you\u2026 I think you guys made a comment that you are making an effort to push down inventories as I guess you're just alluding to. Was there anything special there in the fourth quarter or this is more of that long-term initiatives to just become more efficient there?", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "I think it was a couple of different things. As you saw, probably through last year inventory kind of crept up on us for a couple of different reasons, some planned, some unplanned, up through the third quarter, and we specifically had some very detailed attention on it at a number of different levels during that quarter to bring that down knowing we were going to still have a very good kind of year-end performance. And I would say that as we move forward this year, while we would expect maybe some creep in the first three months to six months, which we typically do, I would hope that the expectation is to mitigate that in that first six-month period, so that we can have that 2 to 3-day improvement for the entire year.", "Steven Postal - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "You bet.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Good morning.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Couple of things here. Bret, just going to your point on the implants and the orthodontics business here in the US, are you seeing any early signs in the orthodontics business? I know your implant business has been up. I didn't hear... I don't think any Q4 specific comments on orthodontics, if you could just maybe talk about that?", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Sure. Our orthodontics business is mostly US. We have a growing representation outside the US, but I would say is still heavily weighted towards the US and it performed very well last year, double-digit growth throughout the year. In certain businesses, for instance in orthodontics, we get occasionally case starts for the industry and we don't have it yet for the second half of the year, but we have it for earlier points in the year, and it looked to us like case starts were slowing slightly as we moved through 2007. Now, in our own business that was compensated by... we introduced some new products early in the year or very late last year, and in particular we implemented or introduced this product called Innovation C, which is a highly esthetic bracket that has the efficiencies of a metal bracket, and it comes to the market at a higher price point than our traditional brackets. So we were still seeing strong growth in 2007 as more or less we were upgrading customers or taking share through the introduction of that new product. But I think it is still early to say what will happen to the orthodontics market, and we will probably be monitoring that closely as we move through this year. But at this point the market looks okay.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "And Bret, is there enough ramp room on Innovation C, the mix benefits there to power through, like you said on the implant side you're able to kind of power through the softening market there given the sales force changes you made. Can Innovation C on mix do that, even if the market does slow in '08 for you? And secondly, I think you guys were implementing like a centralized manufacturing even on the orthodontics side where you could place brackets on a model and send that out to the dentists. Are those plans still under works and could that help at all?", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Well, I think there is a number of factors that could help our business in particular in '08, in orthodontics, mainly the things that you have alluded to. I mean certainly, the penetration of Innovation C is still pretty low. So that product has ways to run and whether that's upgrading our own customers to Innovation C or it's taking share from competitors with Innovation C, obviously that has a strong potential to mitigate, in part at least, if the market itself starts to slow in some meaningful way.", "And the second issue that you raised was new product introductions or new product/service introductions, which includes what's called indirect bonding, which is where you impregnate a tray with implants and that makes it much more efficient\u2026 excuse me, with orthodontic brackets\u2026 impregnating a plastic tray with orthodontic brackets and that makes the procedure to place the brackets on the teeth much more efficient for the orthodontist and we are introducing that service later this year. So that could have a positive impact as well.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Great. And then just for Bill a couple detailed questions I guess here from a modeling standpoint. It is a minor point, but I thought CapEx growth kind of in line with organic growth and looks like it's going to be a little higher in '08. Is anything driving that? And then just gating [ph] of operating margin, the 30 to 50 bps for '08, currency hopefully falls off\u2026 or not hopefully, but currency might fall off here as we get later into '08, so that should help maybe on the gross margin line as you get through the Sultan anniversary middle of the year that should help the gross margin. So will operating margin in the back half of the year be stronger than first half or\u2026 how should that play out?", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "Yes, this is Bill. I think that from our perspective, as you mentioned we've got Sultan that doesn't anniversary until the end of the second quarter and that's absolutely a drag on at least our comparable rate of about 20 basis points to 30 basis points on that. So we would expect from an improvement perspective to probably look better as we move into the second half of the year. But the 30 basis points to 50 basis points that we talked about, that's really a 3 to 5 years kind of average that we kind of target in at, and I'd say that for 2008 we will probably be more at kind of the mid to lower end of that at this point, primarily because of the negative mix drag that's taken place there and also some negative PP variance mix. Keep in mind that purchase price variance mix occurs in the gross profit margin rate. I mean we picked up a benefit on the translation side as we convert those earnings into US dollars.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Right, and then on the CapEx, Bill?", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "And then on the CapEx side, yes, the CapEx side is really being driven from some of the additional growth that we've had. As Bret mentioned, we had double digit growth in all three of the specialty categories right now. We are continuing to add capacity in a couple of those different areas to make sure that we are positioned for future growth.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Great. That's all I've got, guys. Thanks a lot.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Anthony Ostrea with JMP Securities.", "Anthony Ostrea - JMP Securities", "Hi, guys. Good morning.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Good morning.", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Anthony Ostrea - JMP Securities", "Few questions here, just first on your US distribution business, can you\u2026 at least now that you've anniversaried that event, can you tell us what... how it performed in Q4, and then now it is anniversaried what your expectations are for 2008?", "Christopher T. Clark - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Sure. Anthony, it's Chris. I mean, as we looked at it we were\u2026 we certainly saw a ramp-up in the US consumables business in the year, in the fourth quarter. As you know, we anniversaried the implementation of the strategic partnership program. I guess I would characterize it by saying, if you compare the US growth rate in Q4 to what we had in the first three quarters, most of the improvement in the overall US growth rate in the quarter came from the consumable business. So I think that would be the way that I characterize candidly the impact of that now that we've anniversaried. Obviously as we look forward, we are continuing to really enjoy in our mind the benefits of not only transactional data, but candidly the tighter relationship and the increased collaboration with the distributors, and I would expect that what we saw in terms of improvement in Q4, we'd expect that to continue as we move forward.", "Anthony Ostrea - JMP Securities", "And then maybe just to ask a little more about those collaborations, are you seeing\u2026 or are you able to really monetize those\u2026 the data that you are getting from your\u2026 the industry leaders and maybe just cite one or two examples?", "Christopher T. Clark - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes. I guess what I would say is the benefits are several-fold. If you look at it, not only does it help us in terms of really targeting\u2026 are we calling in and marketing to the right dentists, but also we are using the right message and taking about the right products at that time. So I think that we are seeing improvements, if you will, in terms of the impact of our sales and marketing activities through that as a result of that collaboration, but I think the other piece is we're now working with the distributors candidly in a much tighter manner really focusing on specific customers and specific opportunities that their data and our data together are identifying. So we're excited about that.", "Anthony Ostrea - JMP Securities", "Again, this maybe on guidance, and I will take a stab at a few line items in your guidance, so topline internal growth of 5.5% to 6.5%, that indicated that... or at least you talked about\u2026 a little about specialty, particularly in the US and Europe. Would you say... and I think I have these numbers correctly, but I think you grew 4% in the US, 7% in Europe, 9% plus in rest of the world in '07. Are you expecting the '08 numbers to more or less reflect what you did in '07, i.e. lowest growth in the US right on the 4% range and rest of the world still\u2026 and Europe picking up the\u2026 well, if you can call it slack, in the US?", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "Well, it is hard to be risk-specific on regions, but let me take a stab at your question. In 2007, we grew 6.4% in total and I think after nine months we are running at about 6.2%. So we've got a little bit of a boost in the fourth quarter. Frankly, we had a little bit of an easy comparison in fourth quarter. When we came out with 5.5% to 6.5% guidance, that's based on a bottom-up analysis by region and obviously it takes into account some weakening coming in the US or at least the US economy, the signs we see in the US economy. So if things don't improve in the economy, we would probably think we are towards the lower end of that range. If things do improve, we think we could be above that. If I had to guess right now I would say that despite the weakness in the US economy, I would expect our US growth to improve a little bit in 2008 for the reasons that Chris just discussed and that you commented on with the distribution change we made retarding '07 growth a little bit in that segment.", "And Europe we've been growing really well for a couple of year now 6%, 7% growth, which we think is above market in that region of the world. So if I had to guess, I'd probably think the US would pick up a little bit versus '07 and Europe might come down a little bit versus '07. But in total, we are comfortable on that 5.5% to 6.5% range.", "Anthony Ostrea - JMP Securities", "And then just maybe, as I move down the income statement, I heard Bill what you said about operating margins, you are saying 30 basis points to 40 basis points roughly in '08. Below the operating margin line, did you say a negative impact of $0.01 per quarter in other income and then also a 100 basis points to 150 basis points improvement or actually lower tax rate in 2008?", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "That's exactly right, Anthony. So you will see a negative impact on the interest and other category, and you will see a positive pickup on the tax front.", "Anthony Ostrea - JMP Securities", "I haven't really calculated it, but is this... does that wash out on the other income and the tax rate, or is that tax rate benefit actually improving or--?", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "It really depends on what the ultimate tax rate benefit is associated with that, Anthony, but it is probably pretty close, there is probably a slight negative impact between the two.", "Anthony Ostrea - JMP Securities", "Okay. Great. That's all I have for now.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "[inaudible] that we gave on the tax side anyway.", "Anthony Ostrea - JMP Securities", "Okay. I\u2019ll\u2026 go ahead.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "I would like to point out\u2026 I think this was clear from Bill\u2019s remarks earlier, but just to make sure, that 100 basis points to 150 basis points improvement comes off the operational rate for this year not the GAAP rate, because the GAAP rate was forced down artificially by the change in the German tax law as we adjust our deferred tax items.", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "That's correct.", "Anthony Ostrea - JMP Securities", "And just remind me, Bill, is the operational tax rate in '07, was that 30. some...?", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "30.4.", "Anthony Ostrea - JMP Securities", "30.4. Okay. Great. That's all I had for now. Thank you.", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "Okay.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jon Wood with Banc of America.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Hi, thanks a lot. Has the merger and acquisition pipeline changed at all over the past few months? Are prices getting any more reasonable? And then, would you guys be interested in the... if there was an appropriate equipment asset out there, would you guys look to do an equipment deal or are you going to stick towards the consumables?", "Christopher T. Clark - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "On the pipeline, I would say that we're still very encouraged by the discussions we're having with other parties. We think the pipeline is pretty robust. With respect to pricing of deals, I haven't seen much change frankly. I think deals are being priced about where they were\u2026 have been historically for the last 24 months or so. So I don't see a big change there. Now that could change if we start to see some of the other participants in the industry's growth rate change or decrease, then you might get more reasonable valuations. And for some reason I forgot your second\u2026 the second part of your question.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "It was just on your enthusiasm for any equipment type of transactions?", "Christopher T. Clark - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes. Well, equipment represents 25% to 30% of the industry, large equipment. Our appetite thus far has been for consumables and small equipment. I don't want to say never on the larger equipment because you just don't know what the future holds. But I think we have to be convinced that it would improve our overall business. It would give us a more stable product mix and more stable growth platform, and perhaps some pull-through of consumables. And so at this point, I think that large equipment is... we were watching that segment closely with Cone Beam, with some of the things that are happening where it gets tied to the implant type of businesses. But at this point, I think we're still more focused on consumables to small equipment.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "And also, with kind of where the economy is at today and kind of the first earlier stages that if anything that the negative impact on equipment plays, that you\u2019d kind of [inaudible] and see all those were sorting out first.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Sure. And then, Bill, I might have missed this, but did you put any buybacks in the numbers for '08?", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "We do not have buybacks in the numbers.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then one last one, Europe, do you see anything on the horizon as far as the reimbursement is concerned that might be an impact in 2008?", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "Nothing that\u2019s imminent.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "Jon, just to correct maybe that last statement, as far as buybacks is concerned we don't really have any additional incremental buybacks, but we do include buybacks to offset options in our... in kind of the expectations and numbers.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Thanks, Bill.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We'll go next to Greg Halter with the Great Lakes Review.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Good morning, guys.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Good morning.", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "I wonder if you could comment on your R&D spending for the year-end '07, and then your expectations for 2008, and if you could detail the number of new products and some the more significant ones that you see either introduced in '07 or coming for '08?", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "Okay. Let me address the first question. I'm going to let Chris comment on things we introduced in '07, although I think we've covered most of them on previous calls. And we\u2019d like to not forecast a lot of what we are going to do in '08 because we don't want our competitors to know where we are headed. But R&D spend in '07 I think was right in line with historical rates, kind of somewhere between 2.5% and 3% of revenue, and we would expected it to be in that same category, probably towards the higher end of that category\u2026 or that range in 2008. And I\u2019d like to remind you that some of our R&D spend on top of that 2.5% to 3% ends up coming to the cost of goods sold line when we work with outside parties to license their technology. So in total, R&D spend is probably closer to 4% of revenue on an ongoing basis when you include the use of an outside technology.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Chris, do you want to comment on things we introduced in '07?", "Christopher T. Clark - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, Greg. As you know, we commented on that in previous calls. We continue to be very active in that front. I think if you look back over the year, certainly our rate of innovation was at least at if not slightly higher than what we have done in previous years. Just to highlight a few, we talked a little bit on Innovation C and obviously the positive impact that had, not only in the orthodontic growth but also the mix, and again the concept of an all-ceramic self-ligating bracket, that combination is extremely powerful.", "I\u2019ve commented previously I think on the GT Series X endodontic file, basically that utilizes the M-Wire technology coming through Sportswire acquisition, and again that provides the significant boost to a really important endodontic line of GT Series in that it now provides significant improvements in reduction of cyclical fatigue in the files, and the file breakage is certainly one of the major concerns with endodontics and this certainly helps to address that concern and alleviate and then certainly make sure that they are comfortable with the procedure. So I think that's a huge plus.", "We've chatted previously about a couple of larger ones in the restorative area, certainly the B4, which is the pre-additive for impression material that improves accuracy even further, and than also the Lasting Touch polish, which again is really a nice esthetic improvement to an overall restoration. So again, I think just to comment, I think we are pleased overall with the year in terms of innovation. You saw innovation on a number of fronts across our different franchises and businesses, and I think that you\u2019ll\u2026 you can expect to see more of the same as we look to 2008.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "And I think in total, Greg, we introduced 25 to 30 new products this year, kind of in line with what we did in 2006, and the major ones that Chris noted are important, but\u2026 because most new products or new brands in dentistry end up being small, $3 million to $5 million in revenue ultimately. I think the continuation of introducing a number of new products, meaning something in that 25 to 30 range, is as important as anyone new product in the mix.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Okay, that's helpful. And relative to the offshore situation, any update that you can provide us regarding that?", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Are you talking about the lab business?", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Yes.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Oh sure. Just for everyone on the call, what Greg is referring to is that we run a service for our US labs whereby they can outsource to us the production of crown and bridge units, mainly crowns, which are produced outside of Shanghai and then shipped to them. It's about 6 to 7-day turnaround at a very low cost, just because of the differential in labor rates and so forth. And we've been ramping that business up every quarter. The number of technicians continues to grow. I would say the number of companies or customers that seek us out for that service has grown, both in the size of the customers and in the pure number of customers using the service. And I would remind you that we only provide that service to customers who buy our traditional lab products. People can't come and buy stuff\u2026 buy those units from us on a one-off basis. So it continues to grow. Access to highly trained technicians is always an issue. We work with universities in China to get the highly trained technicians. We are very pleased with the progress of the business and also the acceptance by the US customer base. And we only sell those products in US, they don't go to any other markets around the world.", "Christopher T. Clark - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Greg, I guess I'd also add that scenario where we are continuing to invest in terms of additional capacities, to go back to the capital comment. For next year, that certainly is an area where we are putting some money in.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Okay. And is there any fall-outs still from the\u2026 some of these certain discontinued offshore dealers shipping products into the US?", "Christopher T. Clark - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, from a gray marketing standpoint it is an area, Greg, where we have to remain extremely diligent. There is a lot of creative ways to... the folks seem to try to find ways to get product back into the US and frankly for that matter into Europe and other developed countries.", "At this point, if you look back over the last six months or last year, we invest in a couple of different areas. I mean obviously first, we have continued to make some pricing changes, some changes in terms of packaging and labeling in terms of how we mark our product for specific export countries and also for specific export customers. We also then discontinued dealers that\u2026 in various areas including Israel, Algeria, Tunisia, Lebanon, Morocco, and it was numerous dealers that we identified as basically selling gray back into developed markets and we discontinue those customers. We're shipping to those customers both in Q3 as well as Q4. We\u2019ve got several as well right now that we are continuing to investigate. So again, I think it's an area where we\u2019ve made a considerable amount of progress, but it's a scenario where we need to remain there very diligent.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Okay, that's very helpful. And relative to the merger of the US endodontic and implant businesses, in fact the personnel there, is that completed now?", "Christopher T. Clark - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes\u2026 you mean the merger of the two businesses?", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Yes.", "Christopher T. Clark - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes. It was a Q1 2007 event, and then of course we had ongoing training because we were... we had to train both sales forces on the alternative products. So we had ongoing training throughout the year as we tried to bring the now combined sales force up to a level of proficiency in both endodontics and implants.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "And you'd consider them now at that level of proficiency where you want them to be?", "Christopher T. Clark - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "I think they are largely there. There is still some work to be done, and frankly I think there's always be work to be done, but we're well along the learning curve now and I would say that the majority of those reps... the vast majority of those reps have a high level of proficiency in both.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "I think if you look at the North American growth rates for us particularly, as we mentioned in implants, certainly that\u2019s indicative of the fact that they\u2019ve hit their stride and I think are increasingly comfortable, and again we believe we are taking share in that market.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Okay, and one last one for Bill. What is your\u2026 the current\u2026 company's current derivatives position?", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "The derivatives I think at the end of December was about 142 million liability.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Right, thank you very much.", "Operator", "We're going next\u2026 we have a follow-up, Anthony Ostrea, JMP Securities.", "Anthony Ostrea - JMP Securities", "Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Bret, you had mention earlier about the case starts in US ortho, and I believe you had mentioned that you had the first half data and it looked like there was some softening, but not a lot. Maybe\u2026 can you just walk us through maybe in past sessions whether... how much of a slowdown has there been in US case starts? Has it ever turned negative\u2026 if you\u2026 and maybe if you can quantify maybe the reduction in the growth rates in US case starts [inaudible]?", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Let me... I'm going to have to avoid part of that question. Frankly, as you go back to the previous recessions we've had, I mean they date back to '01, there was the recession, then you go back to '90, then '82 and '80. So they are pretty dated and frankly on the orthodontic side I don't have the case starts history for those downturns in the industry. What I was commenting on earlier was, case starts in ortho has not grown rapidly for sometime, I don't know, five, six years, but the ortho businesses have been growing because of innovation. And what we saw earlier in the years, the first half of the year for instance we saw case starts were flat to slightly down in the US. It's not a big surprise to us because case starts in ortho haven't really grown a lot for some period of time. So the fact that they are flat would be a continuation of the previous trend, slightly downward would indicate to us that there is some softening in that market occurring. So at this point, I don't think it's a dramatic impact on the ortho market and we are monitoring it closely, but the data we get is pretty dated by the time we get it. And at this point, our own business is a better... probably a better indicator for us than that market data just because of the time lag in getting it.", "Anthony Ostrea - JMP Securities", "Great. That's all I have. Thank you.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Okay.", "Operator", "Having no further questions, Mr. Wise, I'd like to turn the conference over to you for any additional or closing comments.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Okay. Well, I think we're pretty proud of where we finished 2007. We accomplished many of the objectives that we had set forth at the beginning of year including making some key investments to accelerate growth, getting our business development activities ramped up, and redeploying cash flow in a meaningful way. So we are heading into 2008 with a fairly high level of confidence. We are very cognizant of the swapping of the US economy and what impact that will have on us, and you can rest assured that we will be sure to react to that as we see that softening occur, if it occurs. And we look forward to continuing to update you on our progress as we move through 2008.", "So thank you for the time this morning, and we look forward to talking further as we move through the year.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bret Wise, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead sir.", "Bret Wise ", "Okay. Thank you, Colleen, good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our year-end conference call. This is Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and also with us today are Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Jolleson, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "I'd like to begin today's call with some overview comments about our results for both the fourth quarter and full-year, and also provide some insight into where we see the state of global dental market.", "Chris Clark will then follow with some insights into our approach for cost containment while still funding growth initiatives given the economic environment. And Bill Jolleson will then provide some more detailed insights into our financial results. And of course following our prepared remarks, we will be glad to take any questions that you may have.", "Before we get started, it's important to note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in connection with the risk and uncertainties described in the company's most recent annual report, on form 10-K, our periodic reports on form 10-Q, our press releases and other filings with the SEC. And recording this conference call in its entirety will be available on our website.", "Last night, we announced fourth quarter and full year results for 2008. As noted in the release, fourth quarter sales decline 6.2% on a GAAP reporting basis, and 4.5% excluding precious metals.", "This decline in sales in the quarter was greatly influenced by the strengthening of US dollar, which resulted in a negative impact from currency translation of 4.5% where essentially the entire decline measured on an ex-precious metal basis.", "In addition, internal growth was negative 1.3% in the quarter, driven by slower activity in the US while acquisitions added 1.3%. So, constant currency growth for the quarter was essentially flat.", "The credit prices and the recessionary economic conditions particularly in the US and to a lesser degree in Europe, contribute to notable slowing and dental activity in the fourth quarter, both for our share side consumable business and our specialty products.", "The geographic breakdown for internal growth ex-precious metals was US contracted 12.8%, Europe grew 3.9% and the rest of the world grew 8.3%. In the US, our performance was influenced by number of factors, some of which are specific to our own circumstances and some which were market-driven.", "With respect to the company-specific issues, you may recall that in our third quarter call, we noted that have suffered an outage at that time of our injectable anesthetic product for our US market due to manufacturing issues at our supplier, and that in fact we might not have product available for the fourth quarter.", "That in fact did happen. We were essentially out of the market for the complete fourth quarter. We did began to get supply very late in the quarter, and in January and expect to have supply in Q1, although we would expect some lingering effects of the outage early here in 2009.", "The second matter is that on October 1, going in to the quarter we implemented price increases for our products to go to the dealer channel. As these price increases were higher than we have had in previous years, we did see an increased level of price increase pre-buy activity in September resulting in higher dealer inventories coming into the quarter.", "Above two factors combined with the efforts of, both end-users meaningful dentist and dealers to reduce inventories at this financial crisis emerged and consumer activity dropped off resulting in a rather significant liquidation of our products from the channel in fourth quarter.", "Absent these two factors, we do believe that US performance would have been negative still probably in the mid single-digit range, and our sense is that the US market at retail probably contracted similar to our adjusted results here.", "On a full world basis, as I mentioned previously our internal growth was negative 1.3% and adjusted for the two factors subscribed here, we probably would have been positive in that same range. ", "Overall growth remains more robust in Europe during the quarter where we grew 3.9%. And although this is slower than we have seen earlier in the year, we still see reasonable levels of demand in many regions in Europe as it appears that the global financial crisis has had less of an impact on dental procedures in Europe than what we initially saw in the US.", "Our rest of world grew 8.3%, and remained robust in many of regions, particularly Asia-Pacific, Brazil and Middle East, Africa where we continue to experience double-digit internal growth. We did see some slowing in certain regions throughout the world, particularly Japan which was negative in the quarter.", "Moving to earnings, our performance in the fourth quarter was driven by margin expansion, both at the gross margin line, which was up over 200 basis points and to a lesser degree at the operating margin line.", "During the quarter, we did implement certain reductions or cost containment initiative and mostly driven towards discretionary spending. This combined with the continued mix improvement and the price increases implemented October 1, allowed us to exceed our margin improvement goals by reporting operating margin expansion of 60 basis points in, both the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2008 on a non-GAAP basis. And Chris and Bill will speak to this more in their comments.", "So despite the contraction in sales in the quarter, earnings per share for the fourth quarter improved 4.4% on a GAAP basis and 2.3% on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, I believe, we had a very successful 2008 including sales growth of 9.6% ex-precious metals, a 3.8%, which point of which was internal growth.", "Our acquisition growth was 2.1% for the full year, so on a constant currency basis or constant currency growth for the full year was approximately 6%. Our EPS growth for the full year was up 11.3% on a GAAP basis and 13.3% on a non-GAAP basis. So, all told I think it was a very good year, particularly given the environment we are operating in particularly late in the year.", "In addition, we completed four acquisitions during the year. Two regional expansions of our sales and marketing reach, one new technology for implant supported bridge work and dentures. And finally, ZHERMACK, which closed on December 31st.", "The ZHERMACK transaction adds production synergies and restorative and infection control in Europe for us. Also give us access to certain markets that we were previously underdeveloped in. And it also provides us with a strong technical center for silicon-based polymers. The acquisition completed in 2008 should bring us an additional 4% to 5% growth constant currency in 2009.", "Further we have very strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, good cash flow generation, so we are very well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. both for organic growth and acquisition.", "Given the lack of liquidity from other sources in the market, the M&A climate may improve for us in 2009 and we are very prepared to take advantage of those opportunities should they arise.", "Looking forward, we found numerous government banks or independent projections of economic activity throughout our markets. At this time, estimates for economic growth vary, but directionally there seems to be a consensus that were likely to see a contraction in the overall economy in the developed markets of the world next year. And of course those markets represent about 80% of our mix.", "In addition, there has been numerous surveys conducted of end user dental demand most of which have been in the US. And although the results of these projections surveys also vary, there does appear to be a consensus that dental office visits have slowed and that there has been some downgrading of sorts of the procedure mix in favor of lower cost alternatives.", "So accordingly, our view is that dental demand has and will slow as economic activity drops off. But as in the past, dental should continue to perform slightly better than the overall economy.", "Our planning at this point assumes that developed country dental markets will have a flattish development next year to slightly positive for all of 2009. While developing dental markets, we believe, will continue to grow but at more modest pace than we saw in 2008, probably in the low to mid-single digit range.", "We believe the growth will be lower in the first half of the year as the first half of 2008 was really quite robust, but may improve slightly in the back half of the year, as some developed countries begin to stabilize and show growth and consumer confidence comes back, added in part by the heavy stimulus package that we see being introduced.", "Our sales and earnings outlook for 2009 is greatly influence by the currency exchange rates and the uncertainty surrounding, both economic activity and currency rate movements, internal sales growth is very difficult to predict at this point, and we have chosen not to give a specific guidance for the year at this point.", "But we continue to believe that dentistry will perform better than the overall economy, and we should be able to continue to take share. As previously stated, our acquisition growth should be in 4% to 5% range for 2009 and currency at the current exchange rates will be negative 5% to 7%.", "Our current expectations are that earnings will also be under some pressure due to slower market growth and adverse currency translation impacts. Accordingly, our current estimate is for earnings per share to be in the $1.85 to $1.95 range next year with the midpoint reflecting slight earnings growth over 2008.", "Our guidance reflects our belief that economic activity will not improve significantly until midyear. And accordingly, we expect our growth in both sales and earnings to be backend loaded towards the last half of year. ", "Obviously, there is a number of assumptions in our guidance here probably  many more assumptions than usual, and those may changes as we work our way through the year. So we will update you on this guidance of each quarterly call as we move throughout 2009.", "At this time I would like to turn the call over to Chris Clark, who will give you some more insights into our cost containment efforts, our growth initiatives and where we see the greatest opportunities for growth in the near-term. Chris?", "Chris Clark", "", "Thank you, Bret. Good morning, everyone. I would like to take a few moments and give you some insight into two areas. First, the approach we are taking from a cost containment standpoint, and then key growth opportunities that we see even in the current economic environment.", "On the cost containment side, our businesses are focused on ensuring that they create and maintain operating and financial flexibility through tightened for over both fixed and variable cost despite the uncertain economic climate we are currently operating in. Our approach to this is, both general across our businesses and also specific to individual business units.", "From a general standpoint, we have deferred salary increases across our global salary workforce, including a wage freeze for our officers. All of our businesses are closely monitoring discretionary spending including delay in non-essential travel in lower priority programs.", "From a fixed cost perspective, we are taking a very pragmatic business-specific approach. While all of our businesses are closely monitoring fixed cost including headcount, businesses that are more heavily impacted by the current economic climate are taking a cascading approach in this area identifying any short-term reductions that are appropriate and also identifying downstream contingency options that they can implement, should the situation wants.", "Any actions, will likely be minimal in the areas of sales representation and research and development, and this approach really allows us to address the need for flexibility during the period, but also ensure that we maintain focus and support on strategic growth areas and initiatives both now and in the future.", "To that end, I would like to take a moment and highlight some of the key growth areas or opportunities in this market, including some areas where we are particularly well positioned in the current economic climate.", "We have a number of product lines that are designed to help our customers to reduce their cost structures, including in some cases their fixed cost, which is particularly important now.", "For example in our centralized manufacturing capabilities in the prosthetics area, we are supporting the desire of our lab customers to reduce their fixed cost structures. We believe that were very well positioned in this area with our current range of services along with several new products that we are going be introducing later this quarter.", "In addition, we believe the recent acquisitions and partnerships with both Fulton and ZHERMACK will be particularly beneficial in this economic environment given the fact that both these companies offer a wide range of value position products in their portfolios. We see the Fulton and ZHERMACK brands is providing platforms for additional value-oriented products downstream, and were pursuing several strategies to that end. ", "On a geographic basis, we see some markets as particular growth opportunity in the current environment. We continue to experience solid growth in key developing regions as Bret mentioned, including growth of approximately 20% in both Asia and CIS in Q4 and north of that figure in the Middle East.", "While obviously, many of these economics are also slowing compared to previous growth rates, we believe that the investments we have made in these regions, particularly in the area of expanding our sales force position us to continue to grow well in excess to market.", "We anticipate that these regions will continue to be highly accretive to our overall growth rate throughout 2009 and we are actually continuing to make an ongoing investments and additional sales representation, in particular in many of these regions as well in a handful of other businesses.", "We also believe the current environment provides an opportunity to make appropriate targeted investments that position the business for more rapid growth if the underlying economic conditions improve on the backend of the recession.", "One key example is our first US implant symposium for key leaders which we have scheduled for this June. We continue to view the US implant market as a really key long-term growth opportunity for us. And this event combined with the US introduction of our unique ANKYLOS CX implant and above met design should really help provide a platform to continue to grow at above market rate that are accretive to our overall business.", "I would like to now turn the call over to Bill Jellison, our Chief Financial Officer to discuss the Q4 and the full year financial results in greater detail. Bill?", "Bill Jellison", "Thanks Chris. Good morning everyone. The high level of volatility, both in the global economic and foreign exchange markets during the fourth quarter resulted in a significant negative impact on our business.", "We were especially impacted by the rapid slowdown of the global economy and the corresponding impact on the dental industry along with the negative foreign exchange rate volatility, which impacted the translation of our sales and earnings. ", "As Bret mentioned, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased by 6.2% and sales excluding precious metals decreased 4.5% in the quarter with internal growth, a negative 1.3% in the period. Net sales for the full year were $2.2 billion, an increase of 9.1% over last year, while ex-precious metals were $1.99 billion, an increase of 9.6% for the year.", "The 2008 geographic mix of sales of ex-precious metals was as follows. The US represented 38% of sales, Europe was 41% this year and the rest of the world was 21% of sales. The specialty product category including endodontics, orthodontics and implants had internal growth in the high single-digit for the year.", "Gross margins for the fourth quarter were 58% of sales excluding precious metals, or an increase of 2.2 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in gross margins is a result of favorable product mix arising from higher endodontics and implant growth in the period compared to base products.", "Improving pricing and operating improvements offset somewhat by negative impacts from currency movements in various markets. Full year gross margins were 57.8% ex-precious metal, a 60 basis point improvement compared to last year and product mix, some favorable pricing and other operating improvements were the biggest contributors.", "SG&A expenses were $173.6 million, or 37.2% of sales ex-precious metals in the fourth quarter of 2008, versus 35.5% in the fourth quarter of 2007. SG&A was down sequentially from the third quarter despite strengthening of our sales force in the period, as other cost containment initiatives were put in place to deal with market volatility.", "Cost increased from recent acquisitions, but were offset by the strengthening of the dollar in the period. Total year SG&A was $739.2 million, or 37.1% of sales ex-precious metal in 2008 versus 37.1% in 2007.", "Our sales growth for the year supported the key investments we made throughout the year. As Chris mentioned in his overview, we have taken a number of steps to both minimize some of the more discretionary cost items and our also taking additional steps in some locations to strengthen overall profitability while still investing in other areas to take advantage of a weaker competition during a softer economic cycle", "While we incurred some restructuring charges in the fourth quarter, we do expect some additional restructuring cost this year as we finalize some cost improvement plans. However, we would expect the savings from our activities to have a rapid payback and we do not expect the charges to be very material.", "In the fourth quarter, we did incur some restructuring in other cost. The primary charges coming from a write-down of a note due to changes in the market interest rates and products supply modifications, which occurred in the period. And in-process R&D charge from our recent acquisition and some charges associated with our cost reduction initiatives.", "Operating margins were 16.8% including restructuring and other expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating margins were 18.3% on sales ex-precious metals in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 20% in the same period last year including restructuring and other charges.", "Operating margin ex-precious metals on a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring and other charges in both periods were 20.9% for the fourth quarter of 2008 compare to 20.3% in the fourth quarter last year, a 60 basis point improvement. Full year operating margins were 19.1% on sales ex-precious metals in 2008 and 19.5% in 2007.", "Operating margin on sales ex-precious metals on a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring and other charges were 20.7% in 2008 compared to 20.1% last year, again an increase of 60 basis in 2008.", "Net interest and other expense in the fourth quarter was $9.9 million, or $9.5 million higher than last year's fourth quarter.", "Interest expense was $3.9 million higher in the quarter while foreign exchange transaction losses and other expenses were $5.6 million higher in the quarter compared to the same period last year.", "These transaction losses which primarily resulted from the settlement of the inter company transactions between our divisions were in addition to the negative $0.03 per share impact from foreign currency translation and purchase variances which were provided as an estimate in our third quarter earnings call.", "Net interest and other expense for the full year was $24.9 million which was an expense increase of $28.1 million for the year.", "Net interest expense was $15.4 million in 2008 compared to interest income of $2.6 million in 2007 or an increase of $18 million. The impact of foreign exchange transaction losses and other items in 2008 was an expense of $9.5 million in 2008 versus income of $0.6 million last year, or an expense increase of $10.1 million also primarily related to foreign exchange transaction losses. ", "The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 5.8% compared to 28% in the fourth quarter of 2007 however, the operational tax rates in these periods were 22% in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 30.7% in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "The full year tax rate in 2008 was 20.1% compared to 27.5% in 2007. The 2008 tax rate of 20.1% included an operational rate of 25.9% compared to 30.4% in 2007. The company benefited from various tax adjustments of $17.1 million in 2008 compared to $9.9 million of favorable adjustments in 2007.", "The favorable tax related adjustments in 2008 resulted primarily from a number of favorable tax audits and issue resolutions. The lower operational tax rate for the year is primarily as a result of the tax impact of a German tax rate change which became effective January 1, 2008.", "This change reduced Germany's overall corporate tax rate to roughly 30% effective January 1 from approximately 39% in 2007 and prior. We are also benefiting from a global business initiative implemented in 2008 both of these items are expected to continue to favorably impact our operational rate.", "The operational rate for 2009 is currently expected to be approximately in the same range as the operational rate in 2008. Although, may be impacted by mix and region tax rate changes.", "To better understand and follow some of the following comments you can look at the tables included in our recent press release which provide a reconciliation from US generally accepted accounting principals or GAAP to an adjusted non-GAAP performance.", "Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $71 million or $0.47 per diluted share compared to $70 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "On an adjusted basis earnings excluding restructuring and other related tax adjustments in both period which constitute a non-GAAP measure were $67.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share.", "In the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $68.5 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "A 2.3% increase in diluted earnings per share, net income in 2008 for the full year was $283.9 million or $1.87 per diluted share. Net income for 2007 was $259.7 million or $1.68 per diluted share.", "Net income for comparability analysis on a non-GAAP basis excluding the reconciling items in the press release for the years ending 2008 and 2007 were $285.5 million and $256.4 million respectively. This represents earnings of $1.88 per diluted share for 2008 compared to $1.66 in 2007, an increase of 13.3%.", "Now let's look again it the cash flow and a few balance sheet items, operating cash flow was $99 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2008 and operating cash flows for the year were approximately $336 million compared to $388 million in 2007. 2007 however benefited from a tax net operating loss improving cash flow by $25 million in that year.", "Capital expenditures were $76 million for year, yielding free cash flow which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures in dividends of about $233 million for the year.", "Depreciation and amortization for the year was $57 million and inventory days ended the year at 100 days for 2008 year end versus 95 days last year.", "Receivable days ended 2008 at 54 days compared to 59 days at the end of the third quarter of 2008 and 51 days at the end of last year. While we continue to closely monitor our accounts receivable exposure we are pleased with the tight control we have been able to maintain in this area.", "The balance sheet remains very healthy at the end of 2008. The year ended with $204 million in cash and short-term investments with total debt of $449 million at the end of 2008.", "That's why I repurchased 3 million shares or $113 million in 2008. Based on the company's authorization to manage up to 17 million shares of treasury stock we still have approximately 2.8 million shares available for repurchase.", "We repurchased some shares in the fourth quarter and expect to continue to add some level of share repurchase in 2009. We continue to monitor market liquidity and our investment needs in making these decisions.", "In looking at 2009, we expect completed acquisitions will add nearly 4% to 5% to the top line and are expected to be neutral to slightly dilutive to earnings per share in the first half of the year and neutral to slightly accretive in the back half.", "Currency translation impacts are difficult to predict. However, at current foreign exchange rates, sales growth would negatively be impacted by approximately 6% to 7% in 2009 and will have a correspondingly negative impact on earnings.", "Although global economic markets remain volatile. We do believe that even in a flat to slightly down global economy the dull consumable market should still show positive growth.", "As Bret stated our guidance per earnings in 2009 is in the range of $1.85 to $1.95 per diluted share. This excludes restructuring and other cost, the reversal of the inventory step up from our recent acquisitions which will reverse in Q1 and Q2 and income tax related adjustments.", "That concludes our prepared remarks and we would be glad to answer any of the questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer-Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And we will take our first call from Derek Leckow with Barrington Research ", "Bret Wise", "Good morning Derek. Are you there? ", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "", "Hi there.", "Bret Wise", "Hi Derek, how are you?", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Can you hear me now?", "Bret Wise", "Derek yes, very fine.", "", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Okay great thanks. So you had an unusual item in the fourth quarter was that anesthetic issue and I think you said it was resolved by the end of the quarter. But if you look at that negative 12.4%, what was the actual quantification of that impact on your sales?", "Bret Wise", "Well in total we work on it reviewing that as part of the inventory liquidation as well.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Okay.", "Bret Wise", "And we said that would have been down mid single digits as in fact improves the anesthetic business is about a third of that impact.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "It\u2019s a pretty bit impact, so would your internal growth rate have been slightly positive without that?", "Bret Wise", "The internal growth rate for the full role would have been kind of flattish without that.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Flattish, okay. And you said that it was still lingering, what was the issue there, wouldn\u2019t that be reasonable to assume that we see orders kind of making up for that gap in the early part of the year?", "Bret Wise", "Yes, if production goes smoothly at the outsourcer and they can keep up with the demand that would be the case.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Okay. And was there a corresponding bottom line impact from that also?", "Bret Wise", "Of course, we lost a margin on those sales during the quarter.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Was it about a penny or how much would you say that was?", "Bret Wise", "I would say probably between half a penny and penny something of that sort.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "All right. And then you had really excellent performance on margins and I guess your, I think from Bill's remarks it sounds like those margin improvements are expected to be sustainable even with the lower sales volume, is that right?", "Bret Wise", "I think that's right. We target 20 to 50 basis points a year in margin improvement. In the current year we got 60 basis points, so we are little bit above that may be contingency plans that Chris, went through are ways that we would try to preserve profitability and margins even in a slower growth environment. So, we continue to target that 20 to 50 basis points per year, although, one year it's over the longer term, so some years will be above that range some years will be below that range.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Okay, so this year probably less than probably more like 20 this year, right?", "Bret Wise", "Well, it just difficult to predict because we do not know what's going to happen this year.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Okay.", "Bret Wise", "But I guess my message would be that we still have programs in place to generate margin improvement, we are going to try to do that irrespective with the environment.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "All right. If we try and analyze the bottom line for next year in your guidance in terms of what you said regarding currency you said about $0.03 top line hit as well as $0.03 transactional impact, is that still the same impact you are expecting for '09?", "Bret Wise", "Yeah, Derek that was for the fourth quarter of 2008 that you are talking about and if you look at kind of the impacts that we have got within that category, I think the volatility of the movements and some of the exchange rates that have moved in different directions, may continue to have if rates stay the same as much as $0.03 to $0.04 per share drag on this.", "But the transaction side that was stated that $6 million that was in the fourth Q that's really because of a settlement of inter-company transaction. So it was because of the volatile movement if rates remain relatively the same in this period that line should literally kind of go back to zero. And I think from a projection perspective and for our internal estimates and planning. We always assume that zero because its really dependant upon were interest rates go within the quarter up or down, and you just don't know what those are specifically going to be.", "So we would expect that piece of the impact to in essence be flat.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "That becomes a very easy comparison as you move through the year, right?", "Bret Wise", "Well, for the fourth quarter that should be an easy comparison and once again you have got high level of exchange volatility in that period.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Let me stop there, thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it.", "Bret Wise", "All right, Derek thanks.", "Operator", "And we will now take our next question from Jon Wood with Banc of America Securities.", "Jon Wood \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Hi, good morning.", "Bret Wise", "Good morning, Jon. ", "Chris Clark", "Jon, how are you?", "Jon Wood \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Good, Bret, you do have the end user data now in the US, I am assuming, can you just give us some level of color in to how long you think the destocking, trend continues into the next year? And if you got any perspective on the international market, so that will be great as well?", "Bret Wise", "Well, I think the destocking that happen in the fourth quarter, was pretty dramatic actually. Its hard for us to tell, whether there is more to go yet or not because we don't get dealer inventory levels and we certainly don't get dentist inventory levels. And so it's possible that it could continue for a while but it was pretty severe in the fourth quarter and so we would hope that we have seen most of it at this point.", "With respect to, and you brought we had end user data and we also get other measures of dealer sell out of our products. And that's why we have reasonable confidence that this has happened.", "Looking at international markets I think it happens some of international markets but not nearly to the extent it happened in the US and I have no reason to believe that it's going to continue or get worse in international markets as we move forward.", "Jon Wood \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "", "So, there is just from a devaluation of some of the currencies internationally in Eastern Europe and Asia that is not having an impact that you can see?", "Bret Wise", "Well with respect to devaluation of the currencies in those developing countries and I am glad you raised it, it's an important factor. I mean it is making products produced in Europe or the US much more expensive in those countries or depressing margins in those countries. So that could have an effect and I think we began to see a little bit of that impact now whereas there is some pricing pressure in those markets.", "Jon Wood \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then so just so to understand on the FX situation, so you said negative five to seven on the top line and a similar on the bottom-line. So that implies about $0.09 to $0.13 of EPS headwind, am I doing that right?", "Bret Wise", "Yes, I think as we stated if exchange rates kind of stay where they are at right now we would expect that drag is probably in that $0.03 to $0.04 range. Obviously as you move through into the per quarter. And as you move into fourth quarter of next year which is where the rate obviously changed quite dramatically that quarter should probably not impacted as much or nearly as much as the first few quarters.", "Jon Wood \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Okay and than just quickly, Bill I am sorry if you give this. Did you give us operating cash flow and CapEx guidance for 09?", "Bill Jellison", "", "I did not give guidance associated with that from a CapEx perspective I think that you can probably use some thing in the range of, probably in the $70 million to $80 million should be a reasonable for this year as well. And on the cash flow side of the equation, I would expect that, just running your model through from that perspective would expect some slight improvements on the inventory day side of the equation for sure and hopefully our expectation is that we are not going to give that up in the days.", "Jon Wood \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Yep.", "Bill Jellison", "", "Thanks Jon. ", "Operator", "And we will take our next call from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "", "Thanks, good morning guys.", "Bret Wise", "Good morning Jeff.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "What's the, let me just start Bret, with a couple of things, I guess one touching on guidance for '09, typically over the last few years we thought of your guidance as being conservative and you guys give yourself a bit of a cushion. This year it obviously doesn\u2019t feel like the year and necessarily be thinking that way especially I know you are not giving growth guidance or organic growth guidance. But it sounds to me you are thinking that dental consumable market, 80% of it flat slightly up 20% of it up mid single digits.", "Is that the kind of organic growth again trying to stay away from your specific guidance? But is that kind of how you guys are baking in to get your buck 85 to buck 95 that we do get some organic growth for the year out of you guys?", "Bret Wise", "Well I think its fair to say, two things I would say. First of all I would warn that we really haven't seen an environment like this for a long time, at least not in our institutional memory here and thus these, the guidance is, I would characterize it as less certain than it has been in the past. So that gets back to your earliest comment there about I wouldn\u2019t characterize our guidance as conservative or aggressive either one. But I would characterize it as having many more variables than we are used to happening to deal with. ", "With respect to growth if we look back overtime we can see the general market has traditionally held up better than the overall economy. And thus if we see a slight contraction in the economy the overall GDP economy in the developed world we think that dentistry could continue to grow, although, modestly and we would think we get our share or that perhaps we get more than our share that hopefully.", "And thus that kind of the basis that we are looking at our earnings guidance for next year.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Fair enough. So, we go a quarter or two into this the economy isn't getting better organic growth is staying down. There is risk to the downside to that guidance but at the same time I guess the message is if we get a couple of quarter in and we start to see a little economic recovery then you are feeling pretty comfortable at make a couple of points of organic growth?", "Bret Wise", "Yes, I think that there is probably equal downside risk and upside opportunity in our guidance.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Yes, and how it feels in my model I don\u2019t disagree with that. Next question I guess Bret also kind of just bigger picture, you guys have been investing in headcount even in Q4 at least our understanding on the endo and implant side maybe elsewhere. Most of your competitors are just others throughout the world cutting headcount here or the very least more aggressively managing the expense side. I guess kudos but not doing that I gives you, it's insight in your conviction and your ability to grow here at least whether the storm, but at the same time is there a reason you are not getting more aggressive may be on the expense side as market flow so significantly here?", "Bret Wise", "", "Well, I am going to let Chris to address that, because we have done a lot of work in that area and he kind of started to address this prepared remarks, so Chris, can you elaborate on that.", "Chris Clark", "Thanks Bret, yeah, Jeff, I think the way it goes, I think is reasonable I expected most companies in environment or obviously looking at fixed cost and we are certainly there as well. Many companies and we are going down the similar approach of kind of establishing of Phase I even phase II contingency plans if you will and we are taking really cascading approach to it.", "We are starting obviously with discretionary items including Phase III consolidated individuals as I mentioned, some overhead reductions and some localized restructuring plans and obviously if the situation warrants and the recovery isn't strong or even goes the other way we are prepared to go, you have to go further, we need to.", "Yeah, at this point, I mean, we fundamentally think from the strategies we\u2019ve had particularly in the expanding our sales representation certainly have been very helpful for us, in terms of benefiting the business and certainly can continue to benefit the business downstream as the market recovers.", "So we have invested in sales representation even over the last six months, both in developing and developing regions. Hopefully we can use the strength that we got as a company to take some share from some of the weaker players in this economy. And position to come back on the backend of the recession have been stronger. But obviously it is a series of weird contingency plans and I would say that we are taking a pretty serious look at cost, but obviously we are trying to balance that with upside opportunities.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "All right, Fair enough, and I guess just a follow up there taking your comments Chris and Bill your comments are meaningful restructuring costs at least a dump in to our mile for '09 at this point there is nothing on the books officially as far as restructuring or any kind of salary payouts that would have to go out or anything like that with anything that's like I said at least officially on the books?", "Chris Clark", "I would say Jeff that what we are looking at consistent with what we typically looked at in the past, I mean, if we have opportunities to restructure and improve the business we will certainly do that and if the situation wants that we need to go be more aggressive in that area, we will. So, I would characterize it more in keeping with probably past practices.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "", "Sure. Alright, last two questions, you come up against some tougher international comps especially in Europe over the next couple of quarters sounds to me you feel like that's hanging in fairly well at this point. Even against those more challenging comps spread are you confident we get positive growth there to offset the continued pressure is here in the US or just how should we think about the difference there in the region?", "And then Bill last question for you, if I take that transactional loss from the quarter on inter company loans out. We have also seen now a narrowing of Euro interest rates which should benefit you. I believe going forward narrowing versus US LIBOR anyway, is it fair to think of your net other line below $15 million all in next year or how do we model that?", "Bret Wise", "", "Okay, Jeff. Let me, this is Bret, I will take the first question and then Bill, can take the second question. With respect to Europe as you can imagine there is many different countries there and the growth dynamics differ pretty widely by country but generally speaking I would characterize that things are little better in Europe than it has in the US Although this quarter you saw a growth rate cut in half and what it been earlier in the year.", "So, although it's hard to generalize, if I had to make a statement now I would expect that our growth has a better opportunity to be stronger in Europe than in the US at least at this juncture. Bill, can you address this second question?", "Bill Jellison", "", "Sure. Jeff as far as the information is in the interest and other line category I think the assumption that you are making and the FX transaction related loss side of the equation could absolutely be neutralized. I think on the narrowing of the interest rates and the equation that absolutely we do expect to see an improvement in the interest rate, differential our investment, hedges that we have go out there. Keep in mind though that on the cash balances that we have we will be earning much less income on those cash balances in '09 than we did in '08 but yes, I think you can assume that, that line category should be improved in the neighborhood of kind of the items that you identified.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Alright, great, thanks guys.", "Bret Wise", "Thanks Jeff.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And our next question is from Mr. Bentic M with Aerovena (ph).", "[Bentic M \u2013 Aerovena]", "Hi, good morning.", "Bret Wise", "Good morning.", "[Bentic M \u2013 Aerovena]", "I am less worried if you give this number earlier. Can you give the organic sales growth of the dental implant business in the U.S. and outside U.S.?", "Bret Wise", "No, we did not give those numbers and typically we do not give precise numbers by business or I will tell you that our global implant business grew in the low to mid single digits organically in the fourth quarter actually closer to the mid single digit and low and it was negative in the US.", "[Bentic M \u2013 Aerovena]", "Negative in the U.S.", "Bret Wise", "Yes.", "[Bentic M \u2013 Aerovena]", "Also if you could provide some color on how the dental implant business would grow in 2009, probably about the growth rates and et cetera?", "Bret Wise", "Well, we don give specific guidance by category. What we have said really throughout this year is that we knew the dental implant category and the orthodontics category is been kind of the most discretionary product areas we have and thus probably most vulnerable to economic downturns and that's played out about as we predicted actually. ", "So I am going decline to give a projection of implant growth for the market next year, although, I think in the weaker economy it will be under pressure because it's usually not reimbursed and it's expensive. ", "Bill Jellison", "Bret, may I add as well, I mean it is clear based on the announcements from our public competitors that we do believe even with the numbers that Bret, mentioned we are growing on a high end what the market growth is. And actually capturing share in the implant segment globally despite obviously the tough economic conditions and discretionary nature of purchase as Bret mentioned.", "[Bentic M \u2013 Aerovena]", "All right. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Bret Wise", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "And our next question is from Chrisman Bogan (ph) with MTB Investments.", "[Chrisman Bogan] \u2013 MTB Investment ", "Thanks. Good morning. Can you just talk a little bit and may be give us some color on the impact that you are saying private label is making in your business and how that might look going forward in terms of private label market share pick up?", "Chris Clark", "Yes, sure. There are always going to be dentists that make purchase decisions based on cost and we do believe that some of the fringes in this environment might be looking to take cost out via product selection, but I guess I would say that in general and we believe even in a tough economy. The fact is the primary thing dentists want are really good long term clinical results and products that really improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the procedure. And I think there might be a little bit of pressure on the fringes, but I do not think there is going to be wholesale change if you will in the context of the market dynamic.", "One other thing to keep in perspective is that in the cost of supplies is really only 6% to 7% of the typical dentist cost structure in terms of the dental laboratory. So, it's really not that significant and you obviously with most of products being consumable obviously the cost of any individual product is quite small. So, on a relative basis. I think basically ask you to keep that in mind as well.", "[Chrisman Bogan] \u2013 MTB Investment ", "Do you have any specific numbers that you track in terms of private label share?", "Chris Clark", "We certainly, we track private label and obviously track different segments of the market including the value branded opportunities and products and I think I mentioned some opportunities we have made segment relative to both assortment ZHERMACK portfolios in my prepared comments. So, yeah, I mean that\u2019s something we certainly keep an eye on.", "Bret Wise", "And over the long term we have not seen that very much, private label has had small portion of the market for sometime and it does not move much from the market share that from period-to-period.", "[Chrisman Bogan] \u2013 MTB Investment ", "Okay, so I mean, it would be fair to say then that, I mean even in this type of economic environment, you have not really seen a significant pick up in private label.", "Bret Wise", "I think that\u2019s, fair assessment.", "[Chrisman Bogan] \u2013 MTB Investment ", "Okay. Thanks.", "Bret Wise", "No problem.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Adam Pusard (ph) with Barclays.", "[Adam Pusard] \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hi good morning guys, just a quick clarification for Bill, Bill increase in the minority interest and consolidated subsidiaries, is that due to ZHERMACK or anything else, its little color there that will be helpful.", "Bill Jellison", "Yeah, its due to from an income statement perspective, its not due to ZHERMACK because we did not have any charges there accept on the expense side on the equation but we did start consolidating materialized dental in the period as well as to so both of those two would have impacts and minority interest moving forward.", "[Adam Pusard] \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, great, thanks a lot guys.", "Bill Jellison", "You bet. Just for clarity on that last question, we acquire ZHERMACK on the last day of the year and thus our income statement does not have any sales or expenses other than the in-process R&D write-off ZHERMACK.", "Operator", "It appears that there are no further questions at this time Mr. Wise, I would like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Bret Wise", "", "Okay. Well, thank you again for joining us this morning and your continued interest in DENTSPLY. I think despite the pretty difficult economic environment here in the fourth quarter we had a very good 2008. We also believe the missions and strategies we have remain strong and will allow us to grow faster than the underlying global dental market. ", "We have very strong balance sheet and cash flow model. We feel very confident about our position and believe that we can weather well whatever economic storm confronts us here in 2009 and prosper going forward. And of course we look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through 2009. Thank you.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bret Wise, the Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead sir.", "Bret Wise", "Welcome everyone. Thanks for joining us on our first quarter call. This is Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and also with us today are Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Jellison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "I would like to begin today's call with some overview comments regarding our results for the fourth quarter and some insights into where we see the state of global dental market.", "Chris is then going to provide some insights into our cost containment efforts and how we are balancing that with growth initiatives as well as new product launches. And Bill Jellison will then provide some detailed insights on the financial results. And following our comments of course, we will be glad to take any questions that you have.", "Before we get started, it's important to note that this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. And these should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties described in our most recent annual report, on Form 10-K, and also the periodic reports we have in Form 10-Qs, press releases etcetera SEC. And recording of this conference call in its entirety will be available on our website.", "Last night, we announced our results for the first quarter 2009. As noted in the release, first quarter sales decline 9.6% on a GAAP reporting basis, and declined 6.2% excluding precious metals.", "This decline of 6.2% in sales in the quarter was greatly influenced by the strength of the dollar, as you know which resulted in a negative impact from currency translation of 6.9%.", "Accordingly, absent the adverse impact of currency translation, we reported sales growth of 0.7% in local currencies. This constant currency growth reflects internal growth, which was negative 3.7% and acquisition growth that offset that which was positive 4.4%.", "The global dental market appears to be contracting slightly in the first quarter. I would say probably in the 2% to 4% range. The slowing is most notable in the equipment side of the business including small equipment, which appears to be impacted more in this slowdown than past economic downturns. This is pertinent to us as, while we are predominantly a consumable company, we do sell small equipment that goes along with those consumables and that represents just over 10% of our mix.", "Anecdotal evidence from the market includes a notable lower attendance at recent US dental shows, certainly probably some slowing office visits and in some cases downgrading of procedures.", "In Europe, I would say the signals are more mixed. The international dental show or IDS, which is held every two years in Cologne, Germany took place in March. It had record attendance, which was up double-digits from the last show held in 2007. And, to us that indicates a high level of continuing interest in new dental technologies in that market. However, dental product sales in Europe are now certainly contracting versus 2008, in many ways comparable to what we see in the US market.", "Our own internal growth performance in the quarter was influenced by a couple of things, first the performance of our non-dental business, but also the performance of small dental equipment and to some degree dental inventory reductions. You will recall that approximately 3% of our mix is non-dental.", "Those product categories had a negative impact of almost a full percentage point on our internal growth in the quarter. Accordingly our dental business contracted just under 3% in the quarter on an internal growth basis and with acquisitions our dental business grew between 1% to 2% constant currency.", "In addition, if we look at the small dental equipment categories across all of our product groups, those products contracted double-digits in the quarter and contributed to almost another full percentage point of negative growth during the period.", "We normally don't break our sales down in this fashion but in this period of rapid changes in the economy and the substantial swings we have seen in currency, I think it's important to understand that the underlying dental consumables in our mix were essentially down only slightly in the quarter on an internal growth basis, and grew low single digits constant currency. This despite some continued inventory reductions by our dealers and end users in many geographies.", "Our geographic internal growth was balanced this quarter with the US contracting 3.9%, ex-precious metals, again this is on internal growth basis. Europe was down 3.3% and rest of the world was down 4.2%. The rest of world category was greatly influenced by developing countries, where currencies have devalued rapidly against both the dollar and Euro.", "Interestingly our specialty businesses as a group continued to grow in the quarter with ortho and endo generating low to mid-single-digit internal growth and the implant category down just slightly on an internal growth basis, but that was due entirely to demand declining and inventory reductions in the developing countries. Absent those markets, our implant business continued to grow in the developed world.", "Our chairside consumable products and our laboratory product categories both contracted in the quarter, influenced by the slow economy, but also these are the categories most impacted by inventory reductions at dealers, and to a lesser degree in used locations and also these categories are most affected by those small equipment categories.", "Moving to earnings, we encountered significant headwinds from currency in the first quarter with the dollar strengthening 13% against the euro, 6.5% against the swiss franc and 20 to 30% against the basket of developing country currencies compared to the end of last year. This reduces our earnings from translation of profits generated in those countries, which usually is offset to some degree by our hedging activities.", "Despite this headwind, we did report $0.43 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis in the quarter, down about 4% from the prior year quarter and Bill will cover our earnings in more detail, but overall we view this as a reasonably good performance, given the state of the global economy and the dramatic strengthening of the dollar that we have seen. ", "Looking forward, the economic outlook certainly remains uncertain. As noted previously, we believe dental consumables have, and will continue to hold up better than the overall economy in good times and in bad, and we have no reason to believe otherwise at this point.", "As we look to the rest of the year, we are not expecting a dramatic improvement in the market in Q2, but we do believe that conditions could improve somewhat in the back half of this year. So based on our Q1 performance and expectations for a continued slow market in Q2, our current estimate is for full-year diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.80 to $1.90 range, which is slightly lower than the original guidance we gave you at the end of January.", "This of course is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes restructurings and other cost, the acquisition related costs recognized here in Q1, which Bill will elaborate on more and any tax adjustments.", "In these market circumstances, we have been working very hard to balance our cost management initiatives with our continued investments for growth, including new products and Chris Clark, our President and COO is going to elaborate on that for you further now. Chris?", "Chris Clark", "Thank you, Bret and good morning, everyone. I would like to take a few moments and give you insights into two areas. First an update to the approach we are taking from a cost containment standpoint and then key initiatives and new product launches that should provide us a solid growth platform, even in the currently challenged economic environment.", "The key contributor to our first quarter results was a strong organizational focus on cost containment, because our businesses proactively took actions to create and maintain both operating and financial flexibility, as a result of the uncertain underlying economic conditions.", "While our first quarter expenses reflect the impact of our recent acquisitions as well as the cost of the biannual IDS show, we were very pleased with the spending approach of our businesses.", "Our business leaders continued to closely monitor discretionary spending, delaying and eliminating nonessential or lower priority programs. For example, our travel within and from the US is down by more than a third so far this year, as our managers utilize video conferencing and other more cost-effective communication approaches where possible.", "On the fixed cost side, we are continuing our pragmatic approach of identifying cascading contingency plans that can be implemented on a business specific basis should the situation warrant. Many of our businesses, primarily those that are more heavily impacted by the current economic climate have already taken steps to reduce their fixed costs.", "You might remember that in our fourth quarter call we mentioned that we anticipate modest restructuring charges as we move through 2009 as our businesses address fixed cost. In Q1 we took approximately $1.6 million in restructuring and other charges, most of which were related to these actions and we anticipate a generally similar approach as we move through the remainder of the year.", "I would like to reiterate that any actions taken will likely be very minimal in the areas of sales representation, and research and development. This approach allows us to address the need for flexibility during the period, while also insuring that we maintain focus and support towards strategic growth areas and initiatives, both now and in the future. To that end, we continue to make targeted investments in key growth areas and initiatives, despite the current negative economic conditions.", "We are continuing to invest in sales representation on some key businesses, as we believe that additional customer reach and call frequency will providing meaningful growth over the next few years. We are also spending to leverage opportunities created from our recent acquisitions. We continue to focus on value oriented product opportunities through the Fulton and Zhermack platforms. These brands often address the more price sensitive customer segments, compared to users of our premium restorative brands.", "In addition, we are continuing to expand the geographic reach of our customized precision implant bars and bridges that are manufactured by E.S. Healthcare and now we are leveraging that through the established DENTSPLY infrastructure. We continue to be very pleased with the customer acceptance of the E.S. products and again we are particularly pleased in the current economic environment.", "We also continue to focus spending on innovation efforts and leveraging new product introductions, as customer adoption in the new technologies continues to be a key driver of market share. We were very active in this front and we introduced about 15 new products in the quarter, most of which were introduced at either the IDS show or at the Chicago mid winter show in February.", "In the specialty areas we have recently introduced our Orthoplex 3D orthodontic modeling solution from GAC. This system assists clinicians in case analysis and planning. It accelerates the production of customized orthodontic appliances and eliminates the need for the orthodontist to keep historical patient models, thereby reducing both cost and inconvenience for the customer.", "This system continues to expand our presence in the developing digital orthodontic market. In the endodontics, we introduced eight new products in this segment alone in the first quarter of 2009 including the X-mark easy cordless endodontic motor. This system delivers the benefits of stronger performance and it improved the ease of use for the dentist.", "Finally at the IDS, we introduced the next general race Cercon milling machine. The Cercon Brain 2, as well as the next generation of Cercon art software. These launches allow for the milling of larger or Zirconia blanks as well as for the use of expanded materials and applications. It provides cost efficiencies and more business opportunities to our laboratory customers.", "We were very pleased with the reaction by laboratory customers in Europe to the next generation of the Cercon system at the IDS and we anticipate initial shipments in Europe later this quarter.", "I would now like to call over to Bill Jellison, our Chief Financial Officer to discuss the first quarter financial results in greater detail. Bill?", "Bill Jellison", "Good morning, everyone. As Bret, mentioned, net sales for the first quarter of 2009 decreased by 9.6% in total and decreased by 6.2% excluding precious metals. The sales decrease ex-precious metals for the quarter included a constant currency increase of 0.7%, which includes a 3.7% decrease from internal growth and a 4.4% increase from acquisitions. The quarter also was negatively impacted 6.9% from foreign currency translation as the dollar strengthened against most currencies from last year's first quarter.", "The geographic mix of sales ex-precious metals in the first quarter of 2009 included the US at 39.6%, Europe represented 42.1% and the rest of the world was 18.3% of sales.", "Our non-dental business had a negative impact on our total internal growth rate of nearly a full percentage point in the period. The strong dollar in the first quarter compared to most currencies in the same period last year not only negatively impacted our sales growth, but also had a negative impact on earnings per share in the period of approximately $0.03 cents.", "Gross profit margins as a percentage of sales ex-precious metal content in the first quarter of 2009 were 57.3% compared to 57.5% for the first quarter of 2008. The rate was negatively impacted in the quarter compared to the same period last year due to the impact of recent acquisitions, including over a half a percentage point for recent acquisitions-related activities, which was the roll-off of the inventory step up.", "Operating improvements and product mix within the product lines helped to offset most of the rate impact from the acquisitions. We do expect the recent acquisitions to continue to have a modest negative impact on margin rates for the rest of this year.", "SG&A expenses were $179.2 million or 38.5% of sales ex-precious metals in the first quarter of 2009 versus 37.1% in the prior year's first quarter. These expenses were lower than those in last year's first quarter. However, they were negatively impacted when measured as a percent of sales primarily due to higher expense levels in our acquisitions and costs associated with the biannual international dental show or IDS.", "The recent acquisitions which have a higher expense to sales run rate than our base business also had a negative impact on our SG&A expense levels. These acquisitions are expected to run at a higher percent level through the remainder of the year as these businesses are fully integrated into the company.", "Operational margins for the quarter were 17% compared to 18% in the first quarter of last year. Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals were 18.5% compared to 20.4% in the same period last year. Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals, for comparative purposes, excluding recent acquisitions, acquisition-related activities and restructuring and other costs in both periods would have been 19.4% in the first quarter of 2009 and 20.4% in 2008.", "Most of the change in operating margin rates is due to the fact that we are in the early stages of integrating and investing in the recent acquisitions, as I mentioned earlier. So our base businesses continue to have very solid drop-through in the quarter despite the negative sales pressure in the period. ", "Net interest and other expense in the first quarter was $5.1 million compared to interest expense of $6.2 million last year in the first quarter. The reduction in expense in this area resulted from lower foreign exchange transaction losses in the period offset somewhat by slightly higher net interest expense as interest income rates have dropped significantly and also from the strengthening dollar as our cash investments are held in Europe.", "The current tax rate in the quarter decreased to approximately 26% from approximately 28% in the first quarter of 2008. This rate reduction primarily relates to the benefit of the global business and tax free organization which was recently completed. We expect this to be a reasonable assumption for an operational tax rate for 2009 and is consistent with 2008 full year operational tax rate.", "DENTSPLY\u2019s net income the first quarter of 2009 was $61.7 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared to $68.2 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2008. DENTSPLY\u2019s net income on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, excluding the role off of the inventory step-up, restructuring and other costs, and income tax related adjustments was $64.1 million or $0.43 diluted share in 2009, compared to $68.9 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2008.", "Cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter of 2009 was approximately $11 million compared to $30 million in the same period last year. The cash flow in the first quarter of 2009 was lower than last year really due to both a lower net income in the first quarter last -- and compared to last year and also an increase in inventory levels in the first quarter of this year. The capital expenditures were $14.2 million in the first quarter with depreciation and amortization of $16.4 million in the period.", "Inventory days were 110 at the end of the first quarter of 2009, compared to 100 at the end of the first quarter last year and also at the end of 2008. Inventory increased primarily due to increases in purchased products and due to the softer sales in the period without the corresponding reduction in our production.", "Receivable days were 58 days at the end of the first quarter of 2009, compared to 57 days at the end of the first quarter of 2008 and 54 days at the end of 2008. We believe our accounts receivable are actually in good shape considering the worldwide softening of the global economy and continue to be focused on that activity within our entire team.", "At the end of the first quarter of 2009, we had $226 million in cash and short-term investments, total debt was $486 million at the end of the first quarter and we had availability between both our cash and our available debt under a revolving credit agreement of between $500 million and $600 million.", "During the first quarter we have repurchased approximately $5 million of our stock or approximately 200,000 shares at an average price of roughly $23. Based on the company's authorization to maintain up to 17 million shares of treasury stock, we still have approximately 3 million shares available for repurchase.", "Finally, as Bret noted, based on an updated assessment of the global economy and the dental markets around the world, we are revising our full-year guidance for diluted EPS to a range of $1.80 to $1.90 per share, excluding the impact of restructuring and other costs, acquisition related activities and one-time tax adjustments.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Thanks for your support and we would be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Jellison. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Jon Wood with Banc of America.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "Hey, good morning.", "Bret Wise", "Good morning.", "Bill Jellison", "Good morning, Jon.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "So, Bret, first on the small equipment situation, I know it's difficult to probably estimate this but the IDS show, I mean did that have any impact in pushing some of that into the June quarter? I guess another way to say it is, is the order book for the small equipment better in April?", "Bret Wise", "Good morning, Jon. I wouldn't characterize it that way. The way we are interpreting what we see in small equipment is that in many ways small equipment is a deferrable purchase. You can continue to limp along with your existing equipment or not upgrade your existing equipment and thus it's more deferrable than a consumable that you've got to use on the patient or in the patient that day in your practice and thus our interpretation, and that's all it is, ", "The dentists are just getting a little bit more conservative and deferring to the extent they can those purchases, which are not huge purchases. They are usually items in the $3000 to $5000 range but in this economic environment they are choosing to be a little bit more conservative with their cash. That's the way we are interpreting it.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "Understood, okay. And so, Bill, did Zhermack lose money in the quarter or is that materialized? I'm just surprised to see the minority line swing negative?", "Bill Jellison", "Yeah. Keep in mind that the minority interest line there reflects about three different acquisitions that have actually there's minority interest in those acquisitions and a couple of the acquisitions both Zhermack can materialize -- are both new acquisitions that actually we have acquired because we think that they have got some good technology, we are investing in that technology within the period and also keep in mind that their margin rates for both of those businesses are lower than our overall company average. So it's both a combination of working on the first quarter of the integration as well as the heavier investment level in those divisions.", "Bret Wise", "And Jon, I would add to that that remember Zhermack was bought on the last day of last year and the way we do purchase accounting is we have to value their inventory they owned them on that date, at its sales value. So the first turn to inventory, there's no gross margin on it and thus you have got to cover all your fixed costs with no gross margin, which is not an easy trick to do.", "So that number in the first quarter is much bigger than it would have been had we not had that inventory -- that acquisition-related cost that Bill had mentioned earlier.", "Bill Jellison", "Yes. That 1.8 million that you see there, if you exclude the step-up of the roll-off of the step-up of the inventory, it would have probably been about $1 million.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "A $1 million loss?", "Bill Jellison", "A $1 million loss, that's correct.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "So, Bill, on the balance sheet, is there -- can you talk about just give us some parameters around cash flow this year? I mean, should we expect a flattish type experience for the year on cash flow?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, I mean, based on kind of the guidance that we are giving on the earnings per share side of the equation, Jon, I think that, the guidance that we have got out there is for our earnings to be at or slightly below where we ended last year at. So with that, yes, we would expect our cash flow to be slightly under where we were last year. I think some of the impact in the first quarter is because of the inventory-related activities, which we have got a lot of focus on, as well as in the AR area, although AR, I think the accounts receivable area was in pretty good shape considering the broader based economy.", "And do we think that it's maybe a day or two different, over the course of the year than last year? Yeah, I think that's reasonable on the AR side and I would hope that our inventory levels that, we would continue to work on bringing those back in line.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "Okay, understood. Last quick one, should we assume -- stock buyback continues at a more tempered pace here, given the visibility or do you have appetite to step that up in the near term?", "Bret Wise", "Well, John, we usually don't comment on our intentions about stock buybacks but we do have the 3 million shares authorized. You saw us buy a little bit of stock back this period and as we have said in the past, we would probably be active in buying back our stock kind of on a consistent basis. So that's the guidance we give you at this point.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derek Leckow with Barrington Research.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Bret Wise", "Good morning.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "North American consumables, you are one of the few manufacturers that has pretty high quality end user data and I just wondered if you could compare for us the sales to your dealers versus sales to end users, and what that tells you about the progression of sales growth for the year?", "Bret Wise", "I'll give you a shot at that. What we saw in the consumable category, this excludes the small equipment segment that we kind of outlined for you today, was that retail sales of our products were more like flat, whereas on a wholesale basis they contracted. So we saw a pretty meaningful inventory reduction in the dealer channel. The United States is the only place we get the end user data, keep in mind.", "So in other areas of the world it's a little more difficult to figure it out although we do have some indications what's going on in those parts of the world as well, especially the developing countries where we think there's been a pretty big inventory reduction. But at this point, I would say wholesale is trailing retail by a couple of percentage points.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "And despite that, you said you grew low single-digit in consumables?", "Bret Wise", "No, no. Our consumables and our lab consumables contracted this quarter.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "What were North American dental consumables?", "Bret Wise", "Well. We don't break it down to that level of granularity. But we gave you what that non-dental piece was on the results, we gave you the equipment effect on the results and the specialties, where there are no dealers between us and the end user group.", "So by inference, you can see that wholesale, our dental and lab consumables were down low to mid single-digits", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Oh, I see. Okay. Do you feel that the inventory levels that dealers are such that there might be customer service issues at this point or have we not gotten to that level yet?", "Bret Wise", "I'll let Chris answer that. I'm not aware of any.", "Chris Clark", "It's hard to tell, Derek. To be honest to you, we have not had significant reports of significant customer service issues because of lower dealer inventories. What I would say, though is that, my sense is that dealer inventories could continue to contract a bit moving forward.", "I think the phenomenon that we have seen certainly worldwide over the last couple of quarters, there's no reason to believe that it would necessarily stop here. So, from that angle, I think that it is something that, we look at and we want to continue to monitor in terms of customer service levels, but at this point in time we haven't seen any huge outages.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Okay. And then, just a second question to follow-up on the European situation, at the IDF show, if my memory serves right, that didn't, in fact in the past lead to some deferral purchasing  activity, as doctors wait to attend the show, see the new equipment and then make a decision and did I hear you correctly to say that, you don't feel that's the case this year? This is a little bit unusual, I think.", "Bret Wise", "I think it's too early to tell to be honest. There is a lot of interest in new technologies at the show and as I mentioned, the attendance was up double-digits at the show. So it was a robust environment for reviewing technologies and so forth and so on. What usually happens then is that our reps get follow-up leads, they go out in the field in a couple of months following the show. And that's if they are going to make a sale, that's where they make it on the equipment side.", "So I'm not being negative about that, I'm just saying it's probably too early to really tell whether, what impact that had on small equipment in the first quarter, and whether that will cause it to rebound in the second quarter. I think its just early to throw light on it.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Okay. And then on the operating expenses, you mentioned that, you had a little bit unusual higher expense in the first quarter related to acquisitions and also to the show itself. But just wondering if you think it's still reasonable to expect operating margin to be relatively flat with last year or should we think about that as being a little bit more of a some of the investments you're making, would that lead that to be little bit lower than last year on a ex-precious metals basis?", "Bill Jellison", "Derek, this is Bill. I think that from an operating margin perspective, I think it's realistic to expect that the acquisitions that we have completed already will have a drag on our operating margin late this year, probably not quite to the same level that it was in the first Q but I think they will still have a drag.", "I think as far as our overall business is concerned, with the volume down in the Q1 that obviously puts more pressure on it also from a favorable mix perspective. So, in general I would say that we were probably on our base businesses not too far off from kind of relatively flat excluding the acquisitions and I would say that in this kind of market environment that's probably more of a realistic expectation than to think that they will expand.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "That's what you applied in your new guidance, right?", "Bill Jellison", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you. Good morning, guys.", "Bret Wise", "Good morning Jeff.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "I\u2019m wondering if we can talk about the de-stocking issue a little bit more. From a geographic standpoint last quarter it sounds like in the US that maybe 400 or 500 basis points, I think if I remember the last call correctly, have we worked through at least the majority of that in the US and this quarter it was maybe more a little biased towards Europe or the rest of the world and how do we think about that going forward?", "Chris Clark", "Yeah, Jeff, it's Chris. I would say that what we saw on the first quarter, we saw a broader impact outside of the US than the US whereas in Q4 really it was more focused on the US dealer inventory contractions. I think I would characterize it saying, while we certainly see some -- many if not many if not in most geographies, the fact is that it was far more spread out this time around and particularly in the developing world, some in Europe and frankly some in other developed countries. So, I would characterize it as pretty broad.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "And, Chris, the risk profile I guess over the next quarter or two of inventory stocking really taking the number down dramatically, would you characterize that as high, low, just the very near term acute impact that could potentially have?", "Chris Clark", "Yes, I guess I would say, Jeff, that looking at it, there's a fair amount of inventory in the channel at any given point in time and as our customers both at our dealers as well as in end user level look at it and manage their cash. Quite frankly they are going to end up in a scenario where they may choose to take \u2013 and try to take inventories down and I think that we have certainly seen it the last two quarters.", "I don't think we can really predict in terms of what's going to happen moving forward with a whole lot of granularity particularly given the broad geographic base and the fact that we don't have visibility to a lot of our customers in terms of inventories. But I would that what's happened has been \u2013 it has been, I think relatively indicative of what could happen in an economic downturn and again because of that it may very well could continue here for a little bit.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Sure, okay understood. And then Bret, I guess on the non-dental side and the small equipment side, could you give us just a historical perspective of what those businesses maybe had been growing? And do we think of that as a one to two quarter type impact here and I know the small equipment especially is going to be hard to predict but I'm not sure on the non-dental side, that I quite understand the dynamics well enough to know how to think about that over the next few quarters?", "Bret Wise", "I think the non-dental side, you need to think about it being tied more to industrial-type businesses, which are, more commodity driven and thus, for instance, one of the businesses served through that segment for us is the jewelry business, which is way off at this point. So it has the likelihood of reacting more significantly to an economic downturn than say a dental composite or a dental consumable.", "And thus it's, I think, it's easier to say that it probably will continue to be down, for another quarter or at least until we see an economic recovery, a real economic recovery start to take place. So, at this time that's what my expectations are for that business, the point from our perspective, of course, is that it's small, it's only 3% of our mix.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Yeah, fair enough. And that is not included in the precious metals even though I know the golf clubs, the jewelry stuff are metals that's not included in your precious metals number?", "Bret Wise", "No it's not in our precious metals numbers.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "All right fair enough and Bill, just a couple clarifying questions I guess, for you. How should we think about the net underlying going forward? Is it little bit bigger of an expensive quarter than we would have thought?  Is that a good run rate going forward?", "If you can also just update us on selling days, rest of the year if there is anything between the quarters we should be thinking about? And then I have one more question on the Zhermack that I will follow up here in a second?", "Bill Jellison", "Yeah. As far as the net interest in other category, I would say that we would expect that the interest expense, net expense category should continue to run favorable in comparison to last year. I would say it would have been probably running more favorable but for the fact that the interest income earned on our cash balances are significantly down. I mean, I think we are earning probably a full three percentage point less on our cash invested this year because of the significant drop in overall rates.", "As far as the FX transaction side of the equation, that was actually more favorable to us this year because we had a bigger FX transaction loss in the first quarter of last year and moving forward from a projection perspective, we normally forecast in each of the quarters and for the remaining part of the year on the FX transaction side to be neutral, that there's no impact on at least our current year expectations because we don't know what the movement is going to be within a period, that could be a plus or minus.", "But if you look at what that line did last year, I would say that it was probably not far off of kind of neutral in Q2 and Q3, but if you recall, we had, almost a $6 million hit in the fourth quarter for that last year, so we should run favorable to that in the fourth quarter.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Great. And then on the selling days issue and then I will just get the Zhermack question in there. So you say that ex the inventory step, the back out of the minority loss would have been maybe close to $%1 million instead of $1.8 million, but I'm assuming inventory there doesn't turn in one quarter, so should we continue that run rate to back out at about the one -- north of $1 million anyway for the next couple of quarters?", "Bill Jellison", "No. Almost literally almost all of that burnt off. I mean, there might be a couple of hundred thousand dollars max but, the large majority of that, 90% of that had already burnt off in Q1.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, great. And just a follow-up there is, so if we drop that down to $1 million, but on the $1.8 million this quarter you said, typically we look at a non-GAAP number adjusting out inventory step up, those kind of things and I know you adjusted out to get to the $0.43 number, some acquisition stuff, but the $1.8 million is still in the minority loss line. I'm just trying to figure out if that $800,000 or so delta that was related to inventory step is backed out into the $0.43 number or how do I think about that?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, that's not -- that $2.6 roughly million of roll-off is netted out and it's also got the minority interest piece. So the net number that we are backing out or adjusting to the EPS line is including DENTSPLY ending net impact of that.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, great. And just again selling days, sorry to keep coming back to that if you could just step ups through the next three quarters, any difference in your overall selling days?", "Bret Wise", "Yeah. Jeff, this is Bret. I'll address that. I think the selling days in the next three quarters are pretty neutral to the prior year, meaning maybe it's a day or flat in each quarter. The one consequence that is probably not exactly equal is that Easter fell in April this year, whereas it fell in March last year. And it doesn't have such a huge impact in the United States, but the Europeans typically take several days off at Easter and thus that can have an impact in the second quarter this year, but absence that, I think the selling days are pretty equally.", "Chris Clark", "They are pretty equal. I think we are down one and one quarter and for everything else it's pretty flat, so.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And our next question comes from Yi-Dan Wang with Deutsche Bank.", "Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you very much for taking my question. I've got essentially three questions. First of all it would be great if you can give us the internal growth rate of your implant business in the US, ex-US and globally. I think you said, it declined slightly in internal terms. And then you commented that the decline you saw was, I think if I heard it correctly, largely due to destocking.", "So it would be great if you can give us some sense of what percentage of your implant sales is from distributors versus direct market and to what extent destocking has affected you, how much of that or how much of the decline in the quarter came from that and what additional destocking do you anticipate would occur in the second quarter?", "And my last question is, with regard to, I suppose, deferral of capital equipment purchases and increasing competition in the CAD/CAM dentistry area, how should we think about the performance of your CAD/CAM business in 2009 versus that in 2008? Thank you.", "Bret Wise", "I will try to run through those. It is a number of questions. Internal growth; our dental implant business includes implants, meaning the implant device itself and the abutment, which we kind of call the implant devices, includes some small equipment because there's some drills and so forth that go, and kits to go with the implants occasionally, includes bone growth products and more recently it includes drill guides.", "In total the category was just slightly negative, meaning low single-digits negative. And that all occurred because of the developing countries, which are not a huge part of the mix but developing countries contracted somewhat meaningfully. So without developing countries, the developed countries were up low single-digits. ", "If you look at just the implant devices, meaning the implants plus the abutments, those grew more robustly, kind of mid single-digits in the US, low to mid-single-digits in Europe and of course as I said they contracted in the developing countries.", "In the developed countries we typically take implants direct. So in the US and Japan, and in most European countries; in Australia, in Canada, etcetera, we are direct. In most other countries, we have some form of distribution and thus the effect on our mix is, maybe -- I don't have that number with me now, but I would say maybe 15% to 20% of our mix is through distribution, of that.", "What additional destocking will happen in the implant category in Q2, we have no idea? We just don\u2019t have insights into those developing countries and what those dealers might do in the next three months.", "And deferral of capital equipment, I think, we don't have a lot of capital equipment. The entire equipment category for us is only 10% or 11% of our mix and most of that is small equipment. So the larger equipment CAD/CAM is a fraction of that and I would expect some deferral or slowness of heavy equipment for the next few quarters, although as Chris mentioned, we just launched a new CAD/CAM unit, which had a lot of interest at the IDS so it's possible that in fact that will pick up when that's launched, which probably won't be until late Q2, early Q3.", "Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you very much. That answered all my questions.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Yes. Good morning.", "Bret Wise", "Good morning.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "I was wondering if you could comment on your capital spending plan for 2009.", "Bill Jellison", "Sure. I would say that based on kind of what the overall dental market is looking like; we would probably say that our capital expenditures would be modestly down in comparison to 2008.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Okay. And I just noticed today that there was a story about the Harvard Dental School closed because of a possible case of swine flu. I know it's early here and maybe this is overblown but just wanted to get your read on what's happening with dental offices given the situation?", "Bret Wise", "Well, it's a good question, Greg, although I don't have very good insights into what might have or might not be happening. We haven't heard anything from the ADA, we haven't heard anything from the government with respect to dental practices.", "The news about Harvard Dental School frankly is news to me this morning. I haven't seen that announcement yet. Certainly, dental practices are a place where people do congregate and so forth, but I would say in addition to that, it's probably one of the places where we have best infection control and practices.", "So, at this point I guess I would not expect an impact any greater than what we might see elsewhere in the economy from this flu season, if in fact it gets worse. But I must say that there's not a lot of data or indicators out there for us to rely on at this point.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question is from [Heidi Laurents] with George Weiss.", "Heidi Laurents - George Weiss", "", "Oh, hi, Bill. Can you hear me?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, I can.", "Heidi Laurents - George Weiss", "How are you doing?", "Bill Jellison", "Very good. How are you?", "Heidi Laurents - George Weiss", "", "Good. Just a question on the non-dental business. Can you just breakout for us how much that's contributed to your internal growth metrics over the past year?", "Bill Jellison", "Yeah. I mean, non-dental has actually been not having much of an impact over the last year. I would say it's literally, maybe a little bit more in the Q4 of last year but it's literally just impacting it now and it's because the industrial side. So the industrial piece has actually performed relatively well for us last year, but, obviously, it's a different story in this environment and I would expect that at least in the first half of the year that it will probably have the same level of drag.", "Heidi Laurents - George Weiss", "Okay. So but in the past, can you break out how much it's actually contributed to that your overall?", "Bill Jellison", "I would say it probably didn't change it by more than probably a tenth of a whole point or so in comparison.", "Heidi Laurents - George Weiss", "Okay.", "Bill Jellison", "It's been growing pretty similar to what our overall dental business had been growing.", "Heidi Laurents - George Weiss", "Okay. Great.", "Bill Jellison", "It's just that there was a wide swing this quarter, which is why it made such a big difference.", "Heidi Laurents - George Weiss", "Okay. And any commentary on just overall pricing in the market right now?", "Bret Wise", "I think that it's a little bit difficult to tell, Heidi, in terms of where things will settle out. We took a price increase obviously in across most of our lines later last year and at Q3 in some cases in Q4. We are finding that in some cases, we are having to increase promotional activity, in light of the competitive environment in order to maintain volume. But I would say it's really too early to tell will all of the price increase -- will some of the price increase stick. My guess is we'll get a little bit of it but we're also having to spend some of that back.", "So again it will vary depending on the market and the product category, but we are still finding some opportunities to take price and we actually had a couple of businesses that took incremental price this past quarter.", "Heidi Laurents - George Weiss", "Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks so much. Oh, you know what? Just last question also, just on the impact you're seeing on the private label side of your business. I know it's sort of tied to pricing also?", "Bret Wise", "Sure. Well, Heidi, this is Bret. We do sell a few products private label but not many, so I don't think we are seeing much of an impact at all there. There had been reports of some dealers promoting private label over branded products in the last several months or so, but that seems to have died down at this point. So at this point we would say we are probably not having much of an impact from private label at all.", "Heidi Laurents - George Weiss", "Okay. Great. Thanks so much, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from [Adam Prusard] with Barclays Capital.", "Adam Prusard - Barclays Capital", "Good morning, guys.", "Bret Wise", "Good morning Adam.", "Adam Prusard - Barclays Capital", "Just most of my questions were asked but want to follow up on the acquisition environment. I guess, the difference in price closed recently and what I guess maybe some areas of interest for you guys?", "Bret Wise", "Well, we continue to be interested and active in evaluating acquisitions. I would say the pipeline today is about what it was, mid, late last year. Timing risk is always significant when speaking of acquisitions but I would say we will probably be active in 2009, similar to what we were in 2008 where we completed five transactions and I think we had five also in 2007.", "So we have very strong balance sheet, good cash flow, lots of liquidity from the banks and I think we are in pretty good shape to execute transactions if we can negotiate them at prices that make sense to us.", "Adam Prusard - Barclays Capital", "I think last question for Bill, just underlying currency expectations for the full year and then that 4% to 5% acquisition contribution, is that still the same for February?", "Bill Jellison", "Yeah, I think if you look at the FX expectations moving forward here that, we ended up, you know, close to 7% negative top line in Q1, I think that that will still be pretty high in Q2 and Q3, a little bit better than that in Q4. So in the whole year we will be probably a little bit better, in general on the top line side if rates stay where they are now. But I would say that the general impact as well as on the EPS side will continue at about that level, again, unless current FX rates, change from where they are.", "Adam Prusard - Barclays Capital", "And the four to 5% from acquisitions?", "Bill Jellison", "And the four to 5% from acquisition should still be a reasonable level for the whole year.", "Adam Prusard - Barclays Capital", "Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Elan Chaitovitch with Redburn Partners.", "Elan Chaitovitch - Redburn Partners", "Good morning, this is Elan Chaitovitch from Redburn Partners in London.", "Thank you very much for taking some questions. Three questions on your dental implant business. I am just wondering if you could give us some color on pricing that you are seeing in your dental implant business year-on-year in Q1?", "The second question relates to the impact of low pricing competitors and if you are seeing any shift away from your business from towards those lower priced competitors in your dental implant business?", "And the final question relates to your quite impressive growth rates in your dental implant business, which are way above what most -- well pretty much all the other reporting companies have come out with and I was wondering if could you give us a bit of color in terms of where you are seeing the strongest growth and what you think is driving that growth?", "Bret Wise", "Okay. Let me start with pricing in Q1. I would say we haven't seen any significant change in pricing in Q1 from our perspective. We haven't been promoting the implants heavily or discounting heavily and we haven't seen a lot of that from competitors. We have seen it a little bit in certain local markets but not broad based.", "Likewise, I don't think we have seen much of an impact from low pricing competitors in the developed world. As I mentioned before, our implant growth was down the most in the developing countries where, of course, there's been a 20% to 30% price increase for them on our implants just because the currencies have weakened.", "And in those countries, we see slower sales from ourselves, we think that the dealers are reducing their inventories, but in those markets it's possible that the low price implants are taking share because they are low priced and many times they are manufactured in that currency rather than imported from a US dollar or a Euro based company.", "Our own implant growth, I think is driven by innovation and the product mix we have. We have got a couple of brands in implants that I think are gaining in popularity and we have been doing a lot of marketing to help promote those, including key opinion leader support.", "We have got a product, a tissue care product, it's called ANKYLOS, which we think is very good for getting the tissue to return to close to the implant and thus you don't have some of the negative effects if bone were to, move away from the implant where the abutment joins it and that's gained in popularity. So, I think overall our growth is being driven by good products and good marketing.", "Elan Chaitovitch - Redburn Partners", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Gary Hatton from Granahan Investments.", "Gary Hatton - Granahan Investments", "Hi, good morning.", "Bret Wise", "Good morning.", "Bill Jellison", "Good morning, Gary.", "Gary Hatton - Granahan Investments", "I was just curious just following up on that implant business. Do you have a sense of what the implant market actually grew at during the quarter?", "Bret Wise", "Well. Its anecdotal question, it's probably based on the same information that is in the public domain. I mean, we have looked at the announcements of our competitors and several of them have seen contractions kind of double-digits, kind of the 10% range.", "Others have been closer to our own growth so. S o we think if you average it all out, it's probably mid single-digit down right now. It would be our best guess.", "Gary Hatton - Granahan Investments", "So, obviously you're gaining some share and you just mentioned kind of why you think you are, but is there anybody else out there you think is gaining share?", "Bret Wise", "Well, I mean, there's others out there that have announced relative growth that's higher than their competition, so by definition I think those people are gaining share.", "Gary Hatton - Granahan Investments", "And just one other question on dental office visits. Do you have a sense of what that was down in the quarter?", "Bret Wise", "Well, no. There's no real strong evidence of that. For instance, we don't have a broad -- there is 150,000 dentists or so in the US alone and we don't have really broad-based surveys.", "Gary Hatton - Granahan Investments", "Okay.", "Bret Wise", "What we do have is surveys of 100 dentists here, 100 dentists there and it looks like their appointment books have a few more holes in them than they did maybe a year ago when the economy was stronger. But it's anecdotal to us and that makes sense that there would be some reduction in office visits and to the extent we can --- we've asked our own customers it seems to be there's been a modest decline.", "Gary Hatton - Granahan Investments", "And then just last one on the orthodontic side, are you seeing --what kind of volumes are you seeing on that side?", "Bret Wise", "Our orthodontics business has been relatively strong. It is the fastest growing business we have on an internal growth basis right now and that's mainly a developed market business for us. So, the specialty businesses in total groove and it was the strongest of the three.", "Gary Hatton - Granahan Investments", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Venusti with Kynikos.", "John Venusti - Kynikos", "Yes, hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions for you, because most of my questions have been answered already. On the IDS show, can you give us any idea about what the expenses were that were associated with that show in the quarter?", "Bret Wise", "Bill, do you have a good estimate?", "Bill Jellison", "Sure. I think keep in mind it's probably in the $2 million to $4 million range in general is what we would be spending, but when you look at that, you have to keep in mind that, that show takes place every two years and that in years that show does occur, we have other types of expenses that we cut back on within those same periods. So, if you are looking at it from an incremental perspective, it would be a different story than that.", "John Venusti - Kynikos", "Okay. I mean, can you give us some color on that?", "Bill Jellison", "I would say , I mean, I would say realistically probably you should be reducing that number by about half anyways. In comparison to spending that would have been reduced specifically in years that generally occurs.", "John Venusti - Kynikos", "Right. And that's all recognized in the quarter, right?", "Bill Jellison", "That's all in the quarter, that's correct.", "John Venusti - Kynikos", "Okay. Thank you. Also was there any FX impact on the operating margin line?", "Bill Jellison", "Sure. There's FX impact in each one of the different component areas. I mean, the overall impact for us as I mentioned is about $0.03 negative within this period. And I would say on the operating income, end of the equation, that that's obviously the bulk of that number.", "John Venusti - Kynikos", "Right okay good I missed that $0.03 thing. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from Jeff Johnson with R.W. Baird.", "Jeff Johnson - R.W. Baird", "Sorry, guys. Just the acquisition question was my follow-up and it's been answered. Thank you.", "Bret Wise", "Okay. Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "At this time we have no further questions so I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Wise for closing remarks.", "Bret Wise", "All right, thank you, Camille. Well, thank you everyone for joining us this morning and for your continuing interest in DENTSPLY. As noted today, we have faced slightly slower market here in early 2009, which we believe will probably continue in some form throughout 2009.", "We have been working hard as Chris noted to balance our fixed and our variable cost structure to adapt to this environment and we are comfortable with our capabilities to continue to adapt to it as we move through the year.", "We have a strong balance sheet, a good cash flow model and we are confident with our position and believe we can easily weather this storm and perhaps come out the other side of it with an improved position going forward. So we look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through 2009. Thank you.", "Operator", "Replay information for this call can be found on DENTSPLY's website.

(Operator Instructions).  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bret Wise, President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer.  Please go ahead sir.", "Bret Wise \u2013 President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you for joining us on our second quarter call.  This is Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO, and also with us today are Chris Clark, our President and COO, and Bill Jellison, our Senior Vice President and CFO.  We each have some prepared remarks today speaking to our results for the quarter, how we see the global dental market emerging at this point as well as the outlook and following our prepared remarks we'll be glad to take any questions that you may have.", "Before we get started it is important to note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties.  These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties described in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and our periodic reports on 10-Q, press releases and other filings with the SEC.", "The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.  A recording this call in its entirety will be available on our Web site.", "Last night we announced our results for the second quarter, 2009, and we are pleased to report continued although modest constant currency growth for the quarter, pretty solid earnings results, and that conditions overall in the global dental market seem to be more stable than we saw late last year and early this year and in fact there are some pockets of improvement.", "As noted in our release, sales for the second quarter declined 7% on a GAAP basis and declined 5.6% ex precious metals.  The sales growth ex precious metals was comprised of internal growth of a negative 3.9%, which is comparable to the 3.7% we experienced in Q1, and acquisitions added 4.4% in the quarter giving us constant currency growth of about a half a percentage point. ", "Currency was negative 6.1% in the quarter as the dollar remained stronger relative to most international currencies compared to the second quarter of last year.  As you know, the dollar is again weakened a bit in the recent weeks so this drag may diminish a bit going forward and Bill will speak more to that.", "Our dental internal growth was a negative 3.1% in the quarter as the non dental business continues to lag far behind our dental business.  On an internal growth basis for our dental business, which is 97% of our sales, the specialty businesses were essentially flat in the quarter in the aggregate.  ", "The chair side consumables including small equipment was down low single digits and lab products, in total, were down right at double digits.  At this point, I would say the lab market appears to be impacted most by the continuing global economic conditions and I would say lab equipment in particular.  ", "In recent quarters, there's been a lot of discussion regarding dealer inventory levels and what impact that may be having on our wholesale results from quarter-to-quarter.  Our belief today is that in this quarter we saw changes in dealer inventories as largely neutral in the U.S, perhaps with the exception of the lab based products where we continue to see some reductions.  ", "Outside the U.S. our belief is that there continues to be some dealer inventory reductions and I would say those are particularly in regions that have been hardest hit by the recession and/or those were areas where there has been large scale currency devaluations.", "And although it's difficult to estimate the full impact on our global sales, our best estimate is that it is in the 1% range negative.  The impact is a negative 1% on our internal growth for the quarter and I'd say most of that's outside the U.S.", "The second item to consider is, and we commented on this in our first quarter call, is that Easter fell in the second quarter of 2009 but it was in the first quarter last year in 2008.  Accordingly, we were down one shipping day in the U.S. this quarter and three shipping days in most of Europe due to the timing of holidays.", "And I think these two points continue to be important in evaluating this quarter's results, really how this quarter's results may reflect the health of the global dental market, you know how stable trends are and of course to some extent, how our business is trending.", "Regional internal growth was negative 3.2% in the U.S. and a negative 1.9% for dental only and that was an improvement over the first quarter.  Our European internal growth ex precious metals was a negative 6.6% this quarter, which in fact is worse than the first quarter but this was largely driven by the Eastern European countries as the more developed countries in Europe appear more stable.", "Excluding the CIS our European dental growth was a negative 2%, which is essentially comparable to what it was in the first quarter.  And rest of the world growth was flat this quarter, which was a substantial improvement versus the negative 4.2% we saw in the first quarter of 2009.", "So given that the markets were negatively impacted in the quarter by the timing of the Easter holiday, and probably some continuing dealer inventory reductions, our assessment is the overall global dental market appears to be stabilizing at this point.", "That doesn't mean that it's recovering in the aggregate, but it does not appear to be getting worse at this point.  And I think it's probably important to note that we've begun to see signs of improvement in certain markets, in certain geographic markets and also certain areas of dentistry, and this is certainly true with respect to our results this quarter.  ", "And overall I'd say we're pleased with how most of our businesses are performing in this market relative to the competition, and that's especially true in implants and orthodontics where both were mid-single digits on a constant currency basis and where we think it's clear that we continue to take share.", "On an earnings basis, we had EPS of $0.47 a share in the quarter.  That's down just under 10% versus last year.  However on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the restructuring charges and the tax adjustments, earnings were $0.49 a quarter versus $0.52 on a comparable basis in the prior year, down 5.8% for the quarter.", "We did experience some gross margin contraction this quarter.  However, we also significantly reduced our inventories, which contributed to lower gross margin in the period due to absorption, and we continue to see a negative drag from currency and to a lesser extent an adverse mix.", "On the other hand, we had a very focused program placed throughout the year to control expenses, which has allowed us to mitigate somewhat the effect of slower sales on our earnings performance.  Bill will provide more details on the earnings performance, but overall I feel we had a reasonably good quarter given the environment, our significant reductions in inventories and the need to balance cost savings with investing and growth opportunities.", "I've given our first half performance and outlook for the remainder of the year.  We're maintaining our full year guidance of $1.80 to $1.90 per diluted share and again, that's measured on a non-GAAP basis.  Our assessment of the overall dental market would lead us to believe that some stabilization is occurring and we hope to see some improvement emerging late in the year probably in the fourth quarter.", "As we enter Q3 we're likely to experience some tough comparisons due to the dealer inventory stocking that occurred last year in our third quarter ahead of our October 1 price increases.  I'd say in the prior year we saw increased dealer buying ahead of the annual price increases, which we expect less of this year given our dealers' increased focus on controlling or reducing inventory levels and managing cash flow.", "Any adverse effect from that on Q3 for us however will likely reverse in Q4, so at this point we're anticipating maybe a slightly weaker Q3 on a relative basis and a slightly stronger Q4 on a relative basis due to that effect.  ", "And although we don't give quarterly guidance we would suggest that you evaluate your estimates for the balance of this year for the proper balance between Q3 and Q4 with this in mind.  That concludes my prepared remarks.  I'd now like to turn the call over to Chris Clark, our President and COO.  ", "Chris Clark", "I'd like to take a few moments and give you some insights into two areas.  First, an update on our ongoing cost containment efforts, which are continuing to look to deliver strong benefits to our P&L, and also an update on several new products and key initiatives that should provide us solid growth platforms as we move forward.", "As Bret mentioned, a key contributor to our second quarter results was a continued strong organizational focus on cost containment, and as I mentioned on our first quarter call, our business leaders continued to closely monitor discretionary spending.", "They're taking actions to delay or eliminate non-essential programs and we're really pleased with their efforts.  Total spending in the quarter excluding currencies and acquisitions was down in the mid to high single digit range versus prior year.", "Moreover, the organization continues to proactively identify ways to streamline operations as appropriate as the bulk of the $3.1 million pre-tax restructuring charge that we took in the second quarter relates to efforts taken to reduce fixed costs.", "Looking forward we anticipate additional modest restructuring charges as we continue to address our fixed cost base.  I'd like to reiterate that any actions taken will likely be very minimal in the areas of sales representation and in the area of research and development.", "This approach allows us to address the need for flexibility during the period while also ensuring that we maintain our focus on strategic growth opportunities both now and in the future.  ", "Now we're continuing to make targeted investments in key growth areas despite the currently negative economic conditions.  First, we're continuing to focus spending on innovation efforts and on leveraging new product introductions as new products continue to be a key driver of market share gains even in this economic climate.", "In the second quarter, we introduced the new profile, [vortex] nickel titanium endodontic file to the U.S. market.  This file combines a very flexible design with improved fatigue resistance as well as improved shaping characteristics.  We launched this product in June and we've already seen several significant conversions of competitive accounts intensify in the first month and a half.  ", "In the restoratives area we're introducing the new SHURFIL SDR posterior bulk fill flowable composite base.  This allows for excellent cavity adaptation and also for bulk fill placements up to 4 millimeters in depth.  This results in up to 30% less placement time for the dentist.  ", "Importantly, this unique chemistry employs a new stress decreasing resin system that addresses really one of the primary causes of procedural failures for composites, that is, stress accumulation during adhering.  This product's being launched globally and we believe it really begins to redefine the direction of the key category of composite restorations.", "Beyond the area of R&D, we're also continuing key investments in other areas.  In June, we held our first U.S. Implant Symposium, hosting a series of scientific sessions with over 120 of the top opinion leaders in implantology.  ", "We were very pleased with this event and as well, we were very pleased with the reaction of the participants to the ANKYLOS system, as well as to our new CX abutment design that allows the dentist to select between index and non-indexed options depending on their clinical preference.  We continue to gain market share globally in implants, as Bret mentioned, and in particular, behind the ANKYLOS product line.", "I now would like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the Q2 financial results in greater detail.  Bill?", "Bill Jellison", "Good morning, everyone.  Net sales for the second quarter of 2009 decreased by 7% in total and decreased by 5.6% excluding precious metals.  The sales decrease, ex-precious metals, for the quarter included a constant currency increase of 0.5%, which includes a 3.9% decrease from internal growth and a 4.4% increase from acquisitions.  The quarter was also negatively impacted by 6.1% from foreign exchange translation as the dollar strengthened against both currencies from last year's second quarter.  ", "The geographic mix of sales, ex-precious metals in the second quarter of 2009 included the U.S. at 38.6%, Europe represented 40% and the rest of the world was 21.4% of sales.  ", "Our non-dental business had a negative impact on internal growth of approximately 0.8 percentage points in the period.  We also believe that our internal growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by dealer inventory reductions of approximately 1 percentage point and by fewer selling days due to holiday schedules of approximately 1 to 2 percentage points.", "The stronger dollar in the second quarter compared to most currencies in the same period last year continued to not only negatively impact our sales growth, but also had a negative impact on earnings per share in the period of approximately $0.02 to $0.03.  Based on current currency rates, we believe this negative impact will be somewhat lessened in the back half of the year.  ", "Gross profit margins as a percentage of sales ex-precious metal content in the second quarter of 2009 were 56.1%, compared to 58.2% for the second quarter of 2008.  The rate was negatively impacted in the quarter compared to the same period last year by a number of factors.", "Approximately 50 basis points of the reduction was from the impact of recent acquisitions, including the impact of acquisition-related activities, which was the roll off of the remaining inventory step up.  ", "We were also negatively impacted by lower production volumes, which negatively impacted the absorption of overhead as we reduced inventory levels, the effects of foreign exchange movements and by a slightly negative product mix.  We do expect the recent acquisitions and FX to continue to have a negative impact on margin rates for the rest of this year.", "SG&A expenses were $185.1 million or 36.2% of sales ex-precious metals in the second quarter of 2009 versus 37% in the prior year second quarter.  These expenses were not only lower than those in last year's second quarter on a dollar basis, but they were also lower when measured as a percent of sales.  Expenses were tightly controlled as we worked to not only bring down discretionary costs, but also to reduce various fixed expenses to maintain an appropriate balance in a difficult economic environment.  ", "The recent acquisitions which have a higher expense to sales run rate than our base business continued to have a negative impact on our SG&A expense levels.   These acquisitions are expected to continue to run at a higher percent level throughout the remainder of the year as these businesses are further integrated into the company.  ", "Operational margins for the quarter were 17.8%, compared to 19% in the second quarter of last year. Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals were 19.3%, compared to 20.9% last year in the same period.  ", "And operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals for comparative purposes excluding recent acquisition-related activities and restructuring and other costs in both periods, would have been 20.1% in the second quarter of 2009 and 21.1% in 2008.  Approximately half of the rate reduction in the period is from the impact of recent acquisitions.  The remaining impact is from the lower production volumes, negative FX impacts and a slightly negative product mix.", "Net interest and other expense in the second quarter was $3.7 million, compared to $3.2 million last year in the second quarter.  But remember, in the second quarter of last year, we were benefitted by the $1.8 million reduction to net interest expense for the initial adjustment for the provision of SFAS-157 fair value measurements, which we highlighted as a non-GAAP adjustment.", "Without reflecting this benefit last year, this expense category would have shown an improvement of $1.3 million in expense, resulting from lower net interest expense as interest rates and borrowing levels have decreased compared to last year.  ", "The corporate tax rate in the second quarter decreased to approximately 25.7% from approximately 28.5% in the second quarter of 2008.  This rate reduction primarily relates to the benefit of a global business and tax reorganization which was completed at the end of 2008.  We expect this to be a reasonable assumption for an operational tax rate for 2009 and this year's rate approximately the same as 2008 full year operational tax rate.  ", "However, as the tax rate has had a positive impact on our earnings in the first half of this year compared to the same periods last year, it will have a negative $0.01 to $0.02 per quarter impact for the remaining two quarters of this year.", "DENTSPLY's net income in the second quarter of 2009 was $70.2 million or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $78.6 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2008.  ", "Net income on an adjusted non-GAAP basis excluding acquisition-related costs, restructuring and other costs, interest income from the initial fair value measurement adjustment and income tax related adjustments, was $73.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share in 2009, compared to $79.4 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2008.", "Our cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter increased significantly in comparison to the first Q and was $105 million in the quarter.  And in the first half of 2009, it was approximately $115 million, compared to $139 million in the same period last year.  The cash flow in the first half of 2009 was lower than last year due primarily to the lower net income in the first half of the year and from higher taxes paid in the period.", "Capital expenditures were $25 million in the first half of the year with depreciation and amortization at $33 million in the first half.  Inventory days were 110 at the end of the second quarter of 2009, but generated $21 million of cash flow in the quarter.  Inventory decreased in the period through some solid efforts and is expected to improve further by year-end.", "Accounts receivable days were 58 days at the end of both the first and second quarter of 2009, compared to 56 days at the end of the second quarter of 2008, and 54 days at the end of 2008.  We believe our accounts receivables are in good shape considering the worldwide softening of the global economy, and they remain a key focus of our team.  ", "At the end of the second quarter of 2009, we had $252 million in cash and short-term investments.  Total debt was $420 million at the end of the second quarter.  Year-to-date we have repurchased approximately $10 million of our stock, or approximately 400,000 shares at an average price of roughly $26.00.  Based on the company's authorization to maintain up to 17 million shares of treasury stock, we now have slightly less than 3 million shares available for repurchase.  ", "Finally, as Bret noted, our results to date and our current business outlook provide us confidence to reaffirm our 2009 full year earnings per diluted share guidance of $1.80 to $1.90 on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring and other costs, recent acquisition related activities and income tax related adjustments. ", "I would like to point out, however, that we expect less dealer purchases in the third quarter in advance of our price increases this year compared to last year in the quarter.  This will also result in less destocking by dealers in the fourth quarter this year than in 2008.  We believe this will make the third quarter a more difficult earnings comparison period for us then the fourth quarter.  ", "That concludes our prepared remarks.  Thanks for your support, and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions).  Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Couple things here, Bill and Bret combined, just trying to understand the guidance as far as how it gaits in Q3 and Q4.  Bill, I think in your comments you were talking on the earnings side there on how we should think about Q3 a little more pressure.  But Bret, in your comments were they more or organic growth related that maybe we take a sequential step down a bit in Q3 before picking up a bit in Q4?", "Brett Wise", "", "Well, I think it's potentially both Jeff, and that's a good question.  The guidance that we have out is a $1.80 to a $1.90 a diluted share and of course we don't do quarterly guidance, but as we look at where things stand we know the impact we had last year when we raised prices, a little bit higher then we usually do and we had more dealer stocking in Q3 and then more liquidation of the inventory in Q4.  ", "Well, this year we expect to have less stocking in Q3 which of course depresses a little bit the internal growth and earnings.  And then we expect to see just the opposite in Q4 where because we won't have the destocking that we had in 2008.  So it could have a modest effect on both.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Okay, I guess more than anything trying to understand in Q3, if we had a one to two point organic growth drag this quarter from fewer selling days the worldwide internal growth comp actually gets a little easier in Q3 versus Q2.  So just trying to figure how much of this may be conservatism on your part on the organic growth side for that to maybe tick down in Q3 versus there's something else there I may be missing?", "Bret Wise", "", "No, I don't think you're missing anything.  It's just the two issues that I think our important to note is we did have the less selling days in Q2 and that hurt the organic growth number.  I think in Q3 we're even on days, and Q4 I think there's one more selling day then the prior year.  Is that right?  So the biggest impact on us in Q3 because the days are even with the prior year is whether our dealers want the inventory in advance of the price increase versus the prior year.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "And then Chris, if I could go back to your comments on the fixed cost structure.  You guys are obviously dealing with a lot of headwinds at this point whether it's the negative organic growth that's pressuring margins, the drag currency's having, the [zirmack] and I think materialize is probably still impacting there.  So frankly, I'm surprised operating margins have holding in pretty darn well here.  ", "If we get a bit of organic revenue growth next year, and I know that's probably the key to that assumption and hard to know whether that will happen yet or not, but assuming that happens how much of the fixed cost structure have you taken out at this point?  And how can we think about the leverage that we could maybe even see next year?", "Chris Clark", "", "Yes, I think the way to think about it Jeff is, clearly our businesses have looked at it and to a degree made some choices in terms in saying in this environment there's some things that they had in their base that they probably don't need.  And we've also made some structurally decisions in terms of some things frankly to simply the way we operate.  I think that obviously as things pick up there's probably some spending that we would want to put back in to help accelerate growth but I certainly wouldn't expect us to put in everything that we've taken out by any stretch.  So I do think that we can anticipate some leverage off that.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "And so fair to say, and maybe this is a question for Bill, that if we get some organic revenue growth, whether that starts in Q4 or into early '10, the drop through could be pretty nice?", "Bill Jellison", "Well, I think Jeff, one, we don't give any kind of guidance out for 2010 until we get later on in the year.  But I think that as Chris mentioned, any type of general growth for us obviously helps us on the leverage side, whether it's in the emerging markets or international markets as well as in the U.S. side.", "And while there will be a lot of expenses that are out there, some of those expenses, for example, commission expense that naturally would get reduced in periods like this would be more normalized in let's say 2010.  So there will be some drags of those types of items.  But there were also changes that were made in both the discretionary pieces as well as the fixed expenses that we absolutely want to be maintaining and containing on a more normalized basis moving forward as well.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "And then just last question, last quarter I think you talked about the opportunity from an M&A standpoint to execute on a few deals, I think even quantified it upwards of about four or five or so potentially this year, maybe that's a number I got somewhere else, but still see the M&A environment as favorable at this point?", "Bret Wise", "I would characterize it as that we're very active in that area.  We \u2013 acquisitions is a key part of our strategy and a primary focus for our cash flow.  We're hopeful that we'll have some transactions this year, but there's always timing risk to that, and I would say our focus is consistent with what it' has been in the past.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Bret, your comments in the earlier part of the presentation, the overall more stability, more stable industry conditions worldwide, I think you had said dental in North America was only negative 1.9 and I think you said that the specialty businesses were flat.  I wonder if you could talk more about the specialty businesses and the dental in North America and what you're seeing now in the current quarter?", "Bret Wise", "You mean in the third quarter?", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Yes.", "Bret Wise", "Well, I don't want to comment on the third quarter because we're not even through the first month yet.  But what I will say regarding that is that although we would characterize the global dental market as stable or stabilizing, there are signs of improvement in certain markets.  You've identified one of them.", "In the U.S. we saw some improvement in certain areas, the business, including the chair side consumables, which improved on an organic basis from the first quarter reasonably nicely.  And so we see that as a very positive sign for the U.S. market because that's kind of the bread-and-butter products.", "I would say in Europe, the western European countries, the developed countries, things didn't get any worse than they were in the first quarter, and some of the broader economic signals we're seeing now out of Germany are more positive, and so we hope that that's a turning point as well.", "In the specialty businesses, in aggregate, their internal growth was flat.  If you kind of think about that, I would say orthodontics was the strongest business we had in that category, implants was next and endodontics was third. ", "We had positive constant currency growth in both ortho and implants.  And on an internal growth basis ortho would have been positive and implants would have been just, just negative, and if you break out implants between the developed world and the developing world, the developed world implants grew for us on an organic basis, which was a good sign.  And it was negative of course in the developing countries where currencies have hit so hard.", "So I hope that provides some additional color as to what we're seeing.  We see pockets of improvement, overall stability in the whole dental market.  And I think the signs we see make us more optimistic that the recovery we had hoped to see in the second half in fact will emerge.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "So Bret, are you surprised by the strength of your specialty businesses?  Because I would have thought those would be sort of weaker at this point in time, but it sounds like you're taking market share because I think you're exceeding market growth by a pretty good amount here.", "Bret Wise", "Yes.  I'm not surprised by the strength of those businesses.  We've got some very good products in those segments.  As you might recall, when we kind of entered global recession we said those products, the growth rate on those products, would probably decline the most.  But the fact that they're still growing means that people are still spending money on some of these premium procedures, and I think that's a good sign for the overall market.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "And one more question for Bill.  On the gross margin impact here, if I'm looking at my model and, are you suggesting that the gross margin gets better from the second quarter or gets worse as we go through the third and fourth quarters?", "Bill Jellison", "Well, I think the notable point there on the gross margin side of the equation is a couple of factors.  One, acquisitions had an impact.  Part of that acquisition in this quarter was because of the roll off which is what we classified as a non-GAAP.  There was still a slight drag from the acquisitions associated with the gross margin.", "But the majority of the gross margin impact in the second quarter really came from the changes that we've seen, over the past three to nine months to a year on FX rates, and the impact that they have between the different locations, as well as the lower production volume that we had as we took inventory out and had less absorption on the inventory, or on the overhead side of the equation.  So I think those two or three areas are probably going to continue through the back half of this year.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "I think you quantified it as a 50 basis point impact from the recent acquisitions, is that the right number?", "Bill Jellison", "It was 50 basis points for the quarter, but there was probably about 20 basis points of that was actually related to the step up related issues that completed in this period.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "So that's not going to be repeated in Q3 going forward?", "Bill Jellison", "Not to that level, that's correct.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "And does your price increase that's coming up does that alleviate some of that as well?  I mean, are we going to see an improvement on a sequential basis from the price increase?", "Bret Wise", "Yes.  I think, I mean I think . . .", "Bill Jellison", "", "Price increases will be effective in Q4, not Q3.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "", "Oh, they go into.  Okay, yeah, got it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Wood \u2013 BAS-ML.", "Jon Wood \u2013 BAS-ML", "So Bill, cash flow from ops still expected to be flattish for the year, for 2009?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes.  Keep in mind the first of the year, you know, we're down on that, both because of the earning side ", "of the equation but then also because of the higher taxes that were paid.  But I'd say yes, in the second half of the year we would expect at least a continuation maybe of a second quarter level where it might be a little bit less.  But we should still have very solid cash flow in the second half.", "Jon Wood \u2013 BAS-ML", "", "Okay, and the CapEx, I mean it's, I think you guided or you mentioned down modestly in '09 from '08?  But I mean you're running considerably below that level in the first half, so can you give us some updated thoughts on CapEx?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes.  I mean, I'd say that kind of what you saw in the first half of the year is a reasonable expectation that we're going to be better than we were from a CapEx spending level in 2009 than in 2008, primarily because, you know, keep in mind a fairly good chunk of our overall CapEx in any one year is based on continued capacity related needs that we have, and in a softer or flatter market environment that's not as heavy.", "So I'd say that it's reasonable to expect that it's going to be down maybe, maybe not down quite as much as what you saw in the first half relatively.  But I'd say that it still should be down, and probably down a little bit more than what we were originally stating.", "Jon Wood \u2013 BAS-ML", "So a little bit ahead of the $25 million run rate but not significantly?", "", "Bill Jellison", "That's right.", "", "Jon Wood \u2013 BAS-ML", "Okay.  And then it looks like you paid a big chunk of debt down in the second quarter, right, over $60 million?  Is that right?", "Bill Jellison", "Well, it's really \u2013 you've got to look at the net differential between the two areas.  We've got additional cash in that period and we've got some lower debt because we generated about $105 million of cash flow within that period.  So yes, I mean it's a mix of both the increased cash and a slight pay down on the debt, but that's just under our revolver.", "Jon Wood \u2013 BAS-ML", "But I mean the debt did decrease quite a bit sequentially, and I'm just wondering the rationale for paying down debt right now rather than building cash if you're active on the M&A front?  I mean, is it just a decision of the variances between income and expense?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes.  I mean this is only within our revolving credit facility which goes up and down really on a daily basis.  So as we've got cash here we've paid down locally.  Generally a lot of the cash that we end up holding is European cash, and that's because we don't have the debt within Europe to pay down and/or we don't use those funds directly for stock buyback, so as we generate cash in the U.S. or get additional cash in the U.S. and as we have debt under, let's say, our commercial paper and revolving credit agreement, then that's paid down as that cash is generated.", "Jon Wood \u2013 BAS-ML", "So then on the P&L, the acquisitions you mentioned, negative 50 basis points to the operating margin in the quarter, is that the kind of level we should kind of expect for the back half of the year, the similar level or magnitude of impact?", "Bill Jellison", "", "Well, you're talking the entire impact on the operating margin level was 1 percentage point, not 50 basis points in aggregate, and so \u2013", "Jon Wood \u2013 BAS-ML", "No, I think you said 50, a half of it was acquisition-related?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, half of that, within the quarter about half of that, a little bit less than half of that was acquisition-related at the operating margin level on a non-GAAP basis, because part of that acquisition impact was acquisitions, but that's probably about the right amount.  Between SG&A and the gross margin area that's about correct and we are expecting some continued drag from the acquisition side.", "And as I mentioned on the gross profit side I think you'll see still some negative drag, both from the FX side along with any absorption levels.  But our SG&A is an area that we're continuing to monitor and track as well, too.", "Jon Wood \u2013 BAS-ML", "And then last one, Bret, you did mention the chair side, the U.S. chair side consumables business improved quite a bit in the second quarter.  Do you think that's a function of restocking or is it just the elimination of destocking, if you will, at the distributor level?", "Bret Wise", "I don't think it's restocking.  For instance, if I thought about inventory activity and dealer inventories this year versus last year in the second quarter, I don't think there's more stocking going on now than there was a year ago.  It is possible that there was more destocking in the first quarter than in the second quarter, although I think retail-wise we're seeing some improvement as well.  So I think that looks real to us.  I think that looks \u2013 inclusive of dealer inventories that's end users buying more.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review.", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "You mentioned a few of the new products that you've come out with in the quarter and I was just wondering, given the ongoing focus in emerging technologies in the dental area, I was wondering if there was anything in the way of a major new, I guess, breakthrough product that you could potentially introduce in the next six months or a year?  Or are those types of introductions still several years out?", "Chris Clark", "", "I guess I would characterize our product pipeline as really being as full as it's ever been, including what I would characterize as big products, big new products that will have a pretty significant impact we think on our overall sales, as well as what I would characterize as more characteristic of brand support, if you will, of really ongoing improvements to existing solid brands.", "We typically don't provide guidance in the context of tipping of any major introductions before they come, mainly for competitive reasons.  But I guess I would characterize the overall pipeline as really being about as robust as it's ever been, so we're real pleased in terms of what we're seeing in our innovation efforts, both in terms of the products that we're just now launching and have already launched this year, as well as what we've got in the stable yet to come later this year and also next year.", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "And I haven't heard too much about Oraqix lately, just wondering if I could get an update there?", "Chris Clark", "Oraqix was launched, I don't know, four years ago, five years ago now?  So it's part of our pharmaceutical portfolio.  It's selling well, growing in several regions, and there's several countries yet where we haven't introduced it.  We're waiting for regulatory approval, so I'd tell you it's a solid product and a meaningful product to us.", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Just finally, do you have the accounts payable, what that was in the quarter?", "Chris Clark", "Accounts payable were $93.4 million.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Adam Prusard \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Adam Prusard \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Bret, first question, obviously health care reform has become front and center and I guess there's been some discussion around funding for community health centers on the educational side.  I guess is there anything that you've seen and these ideas that have been thrown out there that get you guys excited?  And then on the flip side of that is there anything that kind of worries you guys?", "Bret Wise", "There's been some discussion about getting \u2013 covering dental or preventive dental procedures as part of the health care reform which we think it's a mixed message.  We think on balance better dentistry will help the population quite a bit.  It also helps us in the long term because the more preventive dentistry we do the healthier the teeth are and the longer they last and that means we continue to do work on them.  That's on the one hand.", "On the other hand I would say government reimbursement has never been a strong driver for dentistry.  When \u2013 the markets that we see as the best growth markets are those that are privately reimbursed.  And as long as the government health care initiative stays with the preventive side I think that can be positive for us.  ", "If it migrated into restorative dentistry I'm not so sure because in other markets where we've seen that there's been restriction on care and so forth that's not been positive.  But we don't see dental being a major driver in this health care reform.  It hasn't really gotten much press and much attention at this point.", "Adam Prusard \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And then I guess, obviously, Eastern Europe has been affected significantly.  I guess, do you have the growth eastern versus western Europe and then I guess how much does \u2013 how much is Eastern Europe of the 40% that's in Europe?", "Bret Wise", "Of the 40% it's a pretty small number.  I don't have it at my fingertips, but I would say kind of 15%-ish?  And if you bifurcate it out we said Europe was down 6.6% including Eastern Europe and down 2% excluding Eastern Europe.  So as you can see, the Eastern European countries or, I'll call it the currency crisis economic recession that Eastern European countries, actually had a pretty big impact on not only our European growth but our overall dental growth in the quarter, and getting that back to zero would have a pretty positive effect on our internal growth mix going forward.", "Adam Prusard \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And then lastly Chris, maybe if you could elaborate, I guess on what are some of the initiatives that you guys have specifically taken to kind of take down your fixed costs?", "Chris Clark", "Sure.  I guess the way to describe it, Adam, is each of our businesses are looking at it in the context of the structures they have in terms of their overhead structure, the people they have in place.  The number of bodies in some places and looking at ways to streamline and quite frankly, I think we've had a number of restructuring efforts across a wide range of businesses, most of them pretty modest, a couple of them a little bit more major.  And again, each of our general managers are proactively looking at ways to make their cost basis as flexible as possible in this environment, and overall we're real pleased with the way they're going about it.", "What I would characterize it as, as I mentioned, typically more in the \u2013 a fair amount in the [J&A] area as we really want to leave sales in R&D in particular as untouched as possible and I think we've been very successful so far in going about it in that approach.  So again, overall we're real pleased.  I wouldn't characterize it as one or two businesses, but really a pretty solid commitment across all of our wide range of businesses.", "Adam Prusard \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And then one last quick question, I guess the price increase you're expecting the end of Q3, would that be similar magnitude to last year?", "Chris Clark", "My guess, and we haven't finalized that yet, but my guess is that it'll be slightly less in percentage terms than last year, and again, because dealers are focused on inventories I guess there'll be less dealer stocking in advance of it than we saw last year.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).  Our next question comes from [Michael Cheuling] \u2013 BAS-ML.", "[Michael Cheuling] \u2013 BAS-ML", "I really have three questions and they're very much focused on your dental implant business and I was hoping you could give us some more clarity on what you're seeing in the dental implant market, both in the U.S. and in Europe and also whether you can make some comments with respect to patient mix for single tooth patients versus the more expensive cases which may have multiple teeth replacement?", "Secondly, maybe on the pricing environment and then thirdly on the ability to collect receivables from your customer base, that would be very helpful.", "Bret Wise", "And that was actually four, for those of you counting that was four questions.  I'll start with U.S. and European dental implant markets and this \u2013 I'm going to characterize it from our perspective, our sales, but I would say that we see those markets kind of flattish.  ", "For us they're not growing robustly and they're not contracting significantly, although we know from our competitor press releases that we've seen thus far, and of course there's a few to come yet, that perhaps we're taking share in those markets because we see them contracting at a substantial rate.  But for our business I'd say both U.S. and Europe are reasonably stable.", "Patient mix, single tooth versus more expensive, we only have anecdotal evidence of that.  I would say there's more \u2013 I would say that the large restorations involving many implants are down and single tooth restorations are probably what's holding up the market at this point the most.  ", "On pricing I haven't seen, other than isolated countries, and only a few.  We haven't seen much change in pricing in this environment, certainly not for our sales, and we have not experience any significant collection problems with regard to our implant sales at this point.", "So Michael, does that cover the points that you had?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vidya Venkat \u2013 Irevna Financial.", "Vidya Venkat \u2013 Irevna Financial", "I have a follow-up on the gentleman's [inaudible].  Could you give the growth number for U.S. and for U.S. dental implants growth number?", "Chris Clark", "Growth numbers for U.S. dental implants.", "Bret Wise", "In the previous comment we said that both U.S. and Europe were kind of flattish, for the developed part of Europe and U.S.  That's on an organic growth basis, not on constant currency.  Then it would have been positive.", "Vidya Venkat \u2013 Irevna Financial", "And a couple of other questions, can you talk about the CAD/CAM business piece and of which what is the proportion of [capital] improvement in consumables?  And probably what would be the peak for this business to do in '09?", "Bret Wise", "I would say the dental CAD/CAM business, which is large equipment, is under a little pressure just because of the amount of capital needed to buy the equipment and probably also concerns about collecting receivables for that equipment.  And we commented on our lab business being down in particularly in equipment, so that's an indicator of that business being under a little pressure.  ", "Ours might be under a little bit more pressure because we've shown a new cad cam unit at the IDS in March which we're going to launch in July or august this year, so there's probably \u2013 our results are probably depressed a little more while people wait for the new unit.  But I think the large equipment segment is one that's under more pressure than the consumable segment.  I think consumables for lab products, although down, are not down nearly as much as equipment is.", "Vidya Venkat \u2013 Irevna Financial", "And can you give us a proportion of how much of the [inaudible] in capital improvement and how much is from consumables?", "Bret Wise", "No, we don't break that down publicly.", "Operator", "Our next question is a follow-up from Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Just one follow-up here, and Chris, going back to the new products that you were talking about, I'm not sure if it's the same as SureFil here that you mentioned, but I'm staring at something on my screen here that launches in 32 days, 15 hours, 33 minutes and 23 seconds right now, code name Amazing.", "Chris Clark", "Yes, that would be SureFil and it is amazing.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Yes, so just as I look at this on the screen here and all that, with SDR] technology and all that, it seems to me you're promoting this a little more than I see other new products ahead of launch and is there a reason to believe this may be that incrementally we should add to the model or anything?  Or is it just kind of another one of those products that drive forward the business but necessarily we try to break out?", "Chris Clark", "Obviously we think it's going to be successful and I don't want to downplay the impact it's going to have on the business, but I would put it in the former category \u2013 the latter category not the former.  I mean, I guess I would look at it, Jeff, and say we're excited about this product because it frankly changes really in our minds the relevant discussion on composites from shrinkage to stress which we think is a really key factor in terms of really the clinical acceptance of composite restorations and really what's one of the major problems today.", "So we're pretty excited about \u2013 quite excited in terms of the product and obviously that's what you see in terms of the prelaunch sizzle, if  you will, behind it.  But in reality, yes, this is similar to many other products that we launch during the year that we think will have a pretty positive impact on our business.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "So the $150 million that I put in my model I should probably pull out?  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time.  Mr. Wise, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Bret Wise", "And I think we'd like to make one clarifying statement.  Bill would like to make one clarifying statement about our response to one earlier question.  Bill, do you want to?", "Bill Jellison", "John Wood, in response to  your question on the change in the reduction of the debt, which may not be as clear on the press release because long-term debt on the press release looks like it dropped off significantly, but the amount that you don't see on the press release itself is that there's about $250 million that's moved into the current portion, the current liability portion.  So we still have that much additional debt, it's just shifted from the long-term to the current portion.  ", "The reason for that is that both our revolving credit agreement will now be due within a year and so we've shifted that.  Our expectation right now is that our revolving credit will probably be renewed or put into place sometime maybe early to mid-fourth quarter of this year.  But that might have been some of your confusion there.", "Bret Wise", "Thank you, Bill for clarifying that, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning and your continued interest in DENTSPLY.  As noted today, we have begun to see and sense some stability in the global dental markets and now believe that we will see modest improvement in the late last half of this year.  That of course is subject to the broader economic conditions and always subject to currency movement which have been quite severe over the past couple of years.  ", "But overall I would characterize it as we feel good about our markets and our prospects.  We look forward to updating you on the progress we have throughout the year and in particular in the back half of this year.", "So thank you.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's conference call.

Jellison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "", "Analysts", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Adam Prusard - Barclays Capital", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Chris Arndt - Select Equity Group", "", "Operator", "Good day everyone, and welcome to the DENTSPLY International 2009 third quarter earnings conference call.  Today\u2019s call is being recorded.  At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bret Wise, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ", "", "Bret W. Wise", "Thank you for joining us on our third quarter call.  This is Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO, and also with us today are Chris Clark, our President and COO, and Bill Jellison, our Senior Vice President and CFO.", "I\u2019d like to begin today\u2019s call with some overview comments on the results and also how we see the state of the dental market.  I\u2019d ask Chris Clark to follow with some insights on our gross margin performance, and then as usual, Bill Jellison will follow with more details on the financial results.  And as usual, following our formal remarks, we'll be pleased to answer any questions that you may have.", "Before we get started, it is important to note that this conference call will include forward-looking statements.  Those involve risks and uncertainties, and they should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and our other periodic filings with the SEC.  The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. A recording this conference call in its entirety will be available on our website.", "Last night we announced our financial results for the third quarter and we\u2019re pleased to announce improved sales performance, a solid overall earnings result, and as we\u2019ll discuss today, excellent free cash flow generation.  These results continue to suggest that we may have seen the trough in the global dental market with some signs of gradual recovery as we move forward.  Total sales including previous metals were up 0.2% in the quarter, and sales excluding precious metals increased 1.1% in the quarter, and that\u2019s a significant improvement from the minus 5.6% and minus 6.2% that we experienced in the first quarters of this year.", "Internal growth was minus 1.5% in Q3, and that\u2019s also a strong improvement over the -3.8% that we had experienced June year to date.  Acquisition growth was 4% in the quarter, resulting in constant currency growth of 2.5% for the period, and the currency impact while still negative at minus 1.4%, represented a significantly smaller headwind in the quarter than we had seen in the first half of the year.  Further, if rates remain where they are today, currency will turn into a positive tailwind in the fourth quarter.", "Our dental business delivered basically flat internal growth.  It was minus 0.3% in the quarter, and that also is a significant improvement over our June year to date performance which was minus 3.0% for the dental only portion of our business.  In total, these results are encouraging, indicating at least a stabilizing if not a strengthening of the underlying dental market as well as continued strong execution I think on the part of our business units.", "Encouragingly, our Q3 internal growth improved across all three geographic regions.  The US internal growth for the quarter was minus 2.6%, and that compares favorably to the minus 3.5% that we had seen June year to date, and that was driven by stronger consumable sales and also solid double digit implant growth in the US.  Internal growth in Europe was minus 1.1%, and again that compares favorably to the minus 2.5% we had seen June year to date, and I think it\u2019s also important to note that European growth was positive in the low single digits if you exclude CIS, and that was led by particularly strong growth in our specialty products where all three were positive on an internal growth and of course a constant currency growth basis in the quarter.", "Rest of world sales also strengthened in the quarter, delivering flat internal growth in Q3, and that compares favorably to a minus 1.9% that we had seen through June.  So I think these geographic results reflect meaningful improvement over what we had seen in the first half of the year providing some comfort that the stability of recovery is not limited to one region or one geography, but it\u2019s more widespread at least at this time.", "Looking at the performance of the various product areas of the business, our specialty businesses as a group again reported low single digit internal sales growth in the third quarter and mid single digit constant currency growth.  This is consistent with a trend we have seen all year as our specialty business growth phases in each quarter in 2009.", "In the specialty category, both orthodontics and endodontics had positive internal growth while implants were essentially flat on an internal growth basis during the period.  So these were positive constant currency.  I think what is interesting in this segment is that our implant business now appears to be very close or perhaps even tied to the number three global position for the implant market.  You may recall that just a few years ago we were number five in the world in the implant market, and I think that\u2019s an indicator that we\u2019ve made substantial progress in this marketplace across a variety of geographies.", "Moving to the dental consumables category, it was flat during the quarter on an internal growth basis and positive mid single digits on a constant currency basis.  I\u2019d add that this is a pretty substantial improvement over what we saw in the first half of the year for the dental consumable as they go through distribution.  Sales in the lab segment were negative mid single digits on an internal basis and low single digits on a constant currency basis, and I think this demonstrates a continuation of what we\u2019ve seen which is that the lab segment is the area under the most pressure as we work our way through the economic downturn, and that\u2019s due in part to patients downgrading to lower cost procedures.", "Overall, we believe these results are stronger than what is probably a slightly improved underlying market, indicating that we\u2019ve probably taken market share during this period.  Our earnings per share in the third quarter were $0.45 on a GAAP reported basis, and that\u2019s up 2.3% from the $0.44 we reported last year.  On the non-GAAP basis, so excluding restructuring and other charges and tax adjustments, earnings were $0.44 a share in the third quarter this year, down 4.3% from the $0.46 we reported last year.", "I would remind you that in the first three quarters of this year we\u2019ve been going up against some very strong results in the prior year, actually record results in most of the quarters.  Q3 2008 was no exception as we had internal growth last year of 5.4% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of almost 18% in Q3 last year.  So given this rather high fertile of a comparison, I think that the performance we saw in the current environment was very solid.", "Our business continues to experience some gross margin pressure due to currency translation, mix, and lower cost absorption across our plants; however, we\u2019ve done a good job of controlling discretionary cost to somewhat offset that impact on the operating margin line.  During today\u2019s conference call, both Bill and Chris have further discussion of margins in their prepared remarks.", "Given the economic pressures that we face here today, we\u2019ve been very focused on cash flow generation.  During the third quarter our operating cash flow was very strong at $130 million which is a substantial improvement over the $98 million last year.  Year to date, our operating cash flow is now up approximately 4% compared to the first three quarters of 2008, and I think this is a good indictor that our businesses are being very diligent, they\u2019re paying a lot of attention to fundamentals of the business as we work our way through the global recession.  Looking ahead, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the market recovery; however, we need to recognize that the recovery will likely be a slow and steady process with both forward and backward steps along the way.  The implications for our business is that we expect to remain very focused on controlling costs and prioritizing specific focus programs that will accelerate our growth as the recovery emerges.", "Given some of the positive opportunities that we\u2019re seeing at this time, we do expect to start some additional investments in the fourth quarter that will likely add about $0.01 per share to our costs in that period. ", "As we look at the fourth quarter, we seen an opportunity to meet or exceed last year\u2019s fourth quarter performance, both in terms of sales and our non-GAAP earnings per share.  We expect to have positive internal growth and positive impact from both our already completed acquisitions as well as currency.  As we mentioned, we do expect some continued gross margin pressures, and again Bill and Chris will talk about it further, and we\u2019re going to be making some investments in the fourth quarter in sales and marketing, and again that\u2019s to the extent of about $0.01 a share.", "Based on these expectations, we\u2019re narrowing our full year guidance to $1.81 to $1.86 per diluted share, and again that\u2019s measured on non-GAAP basis, and this implies EPS gains in the fourth quarter from 2% to 13%.  Again, our assessment is that the overall dental market has stabilized and in some cases has begun to improve.  Our sales and earnings expectations that we\u2019re expressing here are based on our belief that these trends will continue as we move through the remainder of 2009.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Chris Clark.", "", "Christopher T. Clark", "I'd like to take a few moments and give you some insights into our performance and actions in the gross margin area as well as an update on a couple of key new product introductions that should provide us solid growth platforms as we move forward.", "Our gross profit in the quarter was 55.3%, about 200 basis points below our rate in the third quarter of 2008.  This rate reduction is being caused by three primary issues.  First, foreign exchange transactions are roughly a third of the variance, primarily as a result of the strong Japanese yen and also from changes in the European rates.  As you recall, we source a fairly significant amount of product out of Japan and Europe for other markets.", "Second, unfavorable mix, partially offset by favorable price, created approximately half of the year-over-year margin rate gap.  Mix from recent acquisitions caused roughly a quarter of this net unfavorable mix.  And thirdly, reduced manufacturing volume and absorption contributed approximately a quarter of the year-over-year impact.  This was the result of lower production during the period which drove inventories down in the quarter by over $8 million in constant currency compared to a billed of $15 million last year.  However, it also resulted in lower overhead absorption and higher yield cost in the period as well as in higher product cost captured in inventory at the end of the quarter which should roll off in the fourth quarter.", "Providing a bit more color on each of these factors; currency is obviously the most unpredictable issue and difficult to manage in the short term.  With respect to the mix and price impact, we believe our non-acquisition mix issues will improve as the economy improves, and our specialty businesses in certain regional areas grow at a faster pace.  I would also emphasize that our analysis continues to indicate that we have realized favorable net pricing over prior year, at least equal to our normal rate of increases.  Even after adding incremental promotional efforts that had been implemented during the current climate.", "Finally, as we look to our manufacturing variances and our recent under-absorption of overhead, we believe this should also improve as the dental market strengthens.  As I have mentioned in the last couple of conference calls, we have been actively reducing our fixed cost basis while tightly controlling our variable expenses.  We have initiated multiple restructuring efforts this year at many of our locations including a number of our manufacturing plants.  Our approach in this area however has been balanced as we have been careful not to remove infrastructure that will be needed to respond to increased demand as the economic situation stabilizes and improves.  As such our Q3 results reflect the positive impact of many of the savings efforts we have initiated earlier this year, but also reflect our decision to maintain our ability to accelerate production in the coming months to respond to any increased demand.  We continue to be confident this balance prudent approach, and we believe that this impact on our margin will be minimized as the dental market improves and production levels increase allowing our capital to be more fully utilized.", "I would also like to highlight early results from a couple of key new product introductions as innovation continues to be a solid growth driver for us.  On last quarter\u2019s call I briefly mentioned our August introduction of SureFil SDR posterior bulk-fill flowable composite.  This product allows for excellent cavity adaptations and bulk fill placements upto 4 mm in depth and results in up to 30% less placement time for the dentist.  Importantly this unique chemistry employs a new stress decreasing resin system that addresses one of the primary causes of procedural failure for composites; namely, stress accumulation during curing.  In the first two months over 5000 US dentists had purchased the product which reflects an extremely strong level of early adoption.  We\u2019re very encouraged by customer reaction to the technology and continue to believe that this will really begin to redefine the direction of the key categories composite restorations, again, based on the importance of stress reduction.", "I would also like to comment briefly on the European launch of the Cercon Brain expert which is our next-generation Cercon CAD CAM system that has expanded applications and also improved operating efficiencies for the lab.  Shipments of this product also began in August and we\u2019re very encouraged by initial results.  As we look to the fourth quarter we anticipate expanding the launch to include the US, Canadian, and Japanese markets as well.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss the third quarter financial results in greater details.", "William R. Jellison", "Net sales for the third quarter of 2009 increased by 0.2% in total and increased by 1.1% excluding precious metals.  The sales increase excluding precious metals for the quarter included a constant currency increase of 2.5% which includes a 1.5% decrease from internal growth and a 4% increase from acquisitions.  The quarter was also negatively impacted 1.4% from foreign exchange translation.  The geographic mix of sales excluding precious metals in the third quarter of 2009 included the US at 40.2%, Europe represented 38.3%, and the rest of the world was 21.5% of sales.  Our non-dental business had a negative impact on internal growth once again of approximately 1.2% points in the period.  We also believe that our internal growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 0.5% to 1% points from dealers buying less product ahead of our price increases this year compared to last year.", "Currency rates had less of an impact on sales and earnings in the quarter than they did in the first half of this year as the dollar weakened further in the period against most currencies.  Based on current currency rates, foreign exchange will have a positive impact on sales in the fourth quarter.  Gross profit margins as a percentage of sales excluding precious metal content in the third quarter of 2009 were 55.3% compared to 57.4% from the third quarter of 2008.  The rate was negatively impacted in the quarter compared to the same period last year by a number of factors as Chris discussed in detail.  We expect that many of these factors will continue to impact margins in the fourth quarter as will the higher cost captured in our inventory which are expected to roll off in that period.", "SG&A expenses were $178.8 million or 36.2% of sales excluding precious metals in the third quarter of 2009 versus 37% in the prior year\u2019s third quarter.  These expenses were not only lower than those in last year\u2019s third quarter on a constant currency basis despite acquisitions, but they were also lower when measured as a percent of sales.  In fact, on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions, these expenses were down in the mid single-digit range.  Expenses continue to be tightly controlled as we work to not only bring down discretionary costs, but also to reduce various fixed expenses to maintain an appropriate balance in a difficult economic environment.", "Operational margins for the quarter were 17.5% compared to 15.3% in the third quarter of last year.  Operating margins on sales excluding precious metals were 18.8% compared to 16.6% last year in the period.  Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals for comparative purposes excluding the recent acquisition related activities and restructuring and other costs in both periods would have been 19.1% in the third quarter of 2009 and 20.4% in 2008.  Approximately one-third of the rate reduction in the period is from the impact of recent acquisitions.  The remaining impact is primarily resulting from lower production volumes, negative FX impacts, and a negative product mix as Chris commented on in more detail earlier.", "Net interest and other expense in the third quarter was $5.1 million compared to $5.6 million last year in the third quarter.  Net interest expense was essentially flat in the period as lower interest income on investments was offset by lower interest expense from the lower rates and borrowing levels.  Other expenses were reduced slightly also in the period.", "The corporate tax rate in the quarter was approximately 26% and we expect this to be a reasonable assumption for an operational tax rate for 2009 and this year\u2019s rate is approximately the same as 2008\u2019s full year operational tax rate.  Keep in mind however that the operational tax rate in the fourth quarter of last year was only 22%; so it will be a headwind of approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per share for us in the fourth quarter.", "DENTSPLY\u2019s net income in the third quarter of 2009 was $67.5 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to $66 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2008.  Net income on an adjusted non-GAAP basis excluding acquisition related costs, restructuring and other costs, interest income from the initial fair value measurement adjustment and income tax related adjustments was $55.9 million dollars or $0.44 per diluted share in 2009 compared to $69.3 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2008.", "Cash flow from operating activities in the third quarter was $130 million compared to $98 million in the third quarter last year.  Cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of 2009 was $245 million, and cash flow improved over last year as working capital needs were less this year and inventory was actually reduced on a constant currency basis in the first nine months of this year.  Capital expenditures were $43 million in the first nine months of the year with depreciation and amortization at $49 million in the first nine months.  Inventory days were 106 at the end of the third quarter of 2009 generating $23 million of a positive cash flow swing in the quarter as inventories were reduced compared to the same quarter last year.  Inventory decreased in the period through some solid efforts and we see further opportunities to reduce them further.  Accounts receivable days were 61 days at the end of the third quarter of 2009 compared to 59 days at the end of the third quarter of 2008 and 54 days at the end of 2008.  We continue to believe our accounts receivables are in good shape considering the global economy and we remain focused on them.", "At the end of third quarter of 2009 we had $333 million in cash and short-term investments.  Total debt was $395 million at the end of the third quarter.  We also have recently completed a $250 million private placement note to be funded no later than January 19, 2010, with an average maturity of 5 years and a final maturity of 6 years at a fixed interest rate of 4.11%.  This note was entered into to take advantage of low fixed-rate financing in this environment, to have some specific funds to pay off a $150 million private placement note that comes due in the first quarter of 2010, and to have additional flexibility as we renew our revolving credit facility next year.", "At the end of the third quarter, the liabilities under the $150 million private placement note and $63 million of borrowing under the revolver are classified as current maturities as those instruments expire in March 2010 and May 2010 respectively.  However, the new private placement note will replace these borrowings upon their retirement and of course we will renew the revolver prior to its expiration.", "Year-to-date we have repurchased approximately $21 million of our stock or approximately 700,000 shares at an average price of roughly $29.  Based on the company\u2019s authorization to maintain up to 17 million shares of treasury stock, we now have approximately 2.6 million shares still available for repurchase.", "Finally, as Bret noted, our 2009 full year earnings per diluted share guidance of $1.81 to $1.86 on a non-GAAP basis excluding restructuring and other costs, recent acquisition related activities, and income tax related adjustments.", "That concludes our prepared remarks and thank you for your support.  We would be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically.  (Operator Instructions).  We will take our first question from Derek Leckow - Barrington Research.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "A question on the internal growth commentary here; just want to make sure I got these numbers right; I think you said that the implant business was positive outside the US, but negative inside the US; is that the right interpretation of that?", "Bret W. Wise", "No, I am sorry, that\u2019s how it came across, but the implant business on an internal growth basis was essentially flat worldwide.  It was positive in the US, very strong in the US actually, double digits; it was positive in Europe, including CIS, but of course it was more positive excluding CIS, and thus because it was flat for the whole world, you can imply from that the rest of the world regions it was negative, particularly the developing countries.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Is that something market related you think; are you still gaining market share in those markets?", "Bret W. Wise", "I think we\u2019re clearly gaining market share in the US and Europe.  There is not real great data on the rest of the world locations because we really don\u2019t get sales by country from the competitor filings and nor do they get it from us.  So, I think it\u2019s hard to tell on the rest of the world, which comprises about 20% of the market, but I think clearly in the developed countries, we\u2019re still taking share.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "I have a question here on the gross margin pressure; it sounds like you guys did take a price increase, but it wasn\u2019t as large as last year; is that right?", "Bret W. Wise", "Yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Was it about a 2% point increase or what was the average?", "Bret W. Wise", "It was in that neighborhood Derek, pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve historically taken.  The price increase we took last fall was above that, but this is much more in line with what historical norms would be.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "So is it fair to infer that perhaps we saw some delayed purchases that would otherwise have been occurring in this quarter that may wind up actually occurring in the fourth quarter this year?", "Bret W. Wise", "I think, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s delayed purchases Derek as much as it as our dealers probably didn\u2019t buy inventory at a higher rate this year as they did last year.  Meaning, they still bought ahead to get the pre-buy discount; meaning, the 2% or 1.5%, whatever it is, varies by product, but their buy-ahead was less robust than it was last year.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Yes, and last year you had a pretty strong margin period in the fourth quarter; so I am wondering, should we expect to see some lift from that activity in the fourth quarter?", "Bret W. Wise", "On a gross margin basis I don\u2019t expect that.  I think last year\u2019s fourth quarter got a lift from mix more than anything.  So, I think as Bill commented on in gross margins and so did Chris, we expect that the fourth quarter will probably still be under pressure on a gross margin basis, particularly because of the higher costs sitting in inventory.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Bret, your comments about the investments in sales and marketing; normally we see companies make those comments when they have pretty good visibility that things are improving and obviously that must be the reason why you decided that this is the right time to make those investments; can you tell us what you\u2019re seeing out there and what your expectations are; any early preliminary comments on 2010?", "Bret W. Wise", "With respect to the investments, I think these are company specific opportunities, more so than they are broad market changes that are driving us.  I don\u2019t want to be telegraphed in too much detail what we\u2019re contemplating, but for the company there are some markets or some opportunities that we think we need to take advantage of and that is going to require some additional sales and marketing investments that we\u2019re going to make in the fourth quarter.  As far as 2010 goes, I think it\u2019s too early to comment on it.  We\u2019re going to start our planning cycle in the next week or so and it runs through December, and so our intention at this point is to give you guidance on 2010 on our, probably what will be, an early February call when we cover the fourth quarter.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "These investments; are they personnel primarily?", "Bret W. Wise", "They are personnel primarily.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Any particular geographies for that?", "Bret W. Wise", "Yes, but I don\u2019t want to comment on that.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Just wondering a few things here; Bret you made the comment early in the call that you expect Q4 organic growth positive, I think we\u2019re all hoping it would be; just to temp our expectations down a little bit here, should it be in the low single-digit range, and I know you don\u2019t give guidance around that, but it\u2019s pretty easy to look at those comps and think we could be back to a 5% growth rate in the fourth quarter.", "Bret W. Wise", "That\u2019s a good question Jeff, and you\u2019re probably not going to be satisfied with the answer I think; we\u2019ve avoided doing internal growth guidance this year because of the uncertainty in the market and that\u2019s proven to be prudent, I think, up to the third quarter, but as we look at the fourth quarter, we do see an opportunity to have positive internal growth given what we see today, and that\u2019s a pretty big turn around compared to what we\u2019ve seen so far this year.  So, we\u2019re not going to characterize it further than that other than say that it is an indication that our confidence level about moving to the fourth quarter has improved slightly versus the visibility we would have had earlier in the year.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "A somewhat satisfying, I guess, answer.  If I think about organic growth then in my mind where I\u2019ve got it in, in the 2%, 3%, or 4%, somewhere in there, Bill, it sounds to me like gross margin and operating margin then, in the fourth quarter, still had to be down close to what they were down today; is that the balance to be thinking anyway whatever organic growth is up a few points, then margins are going to have to be down; 50 to 100 basis points again?", "William R. Jellison", "Keep in mind Jeff that we reiterated that the number that drags that Chris highlighted as well are still going to continue in the fourth quarter, plus we also stated that there are some costs that are captured in our inventory levels at this point that are ultimately going to roll off in the fourth quarter as well.  So, I think that you will absolutely have some additional margin pressures in that period.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Bret, just bigger picture kind of conceptually, I talked to you about this maybe a month ago or so, but just want to go back to it, if we can get to kind of 2010 organic growth in the low single digit, that is 2% to 3%, somewhere in there, you still feel comfortable that 20 to 30 basis points of margin expansion you can deliver with a modicum of organic growth next year?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "Again, we\u2019re pretty early in our planning cycle for next year, however, I will say based on historic models of the company, when we can get organic growth in that range or so, we do a pretty good job getting drop-through, and thus that\u2019s why we have that 20 to 40 or 20 to 50 basis points per year target, and at this point I would say we\u2019re not moving away from that.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Yes, I\u2019m just trying to think as it played off the yen strength especially and the impact that will have on the ortho businesses something different fundamentally in \u201910 than maybe in past years that\u2019s been.", "Bret W. Wise", "The yen is always an issue, the euro is going to be an issue but there\u2019s lot of moving parts other than those and thus the guidance we\u2019ve given in the past I think would still be the guidance we have today and we haven\u2019t done the planning for next year yet.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Last two questions; you have a very nice bounce-back from an organic growth standpoint and my understanding is Russia is still somewhat of a disaster over there from a dental standpoint, so, when do we anniversary kind of what has been I think anyway probably down 20%, 25% for you guys in Russia the last couple quarters at least, when does that anniversary, and when it does, is there any reason to think that Europe doesn\u2019t go back to positive organic growth probably even sooner than the US?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "The significant pressure in the CIS kind of started in the first quarter, so, I would say we\u2019ll anniversary as we enter 2010, and as I commented today, Europe in total was down slightly by 1.1%, but without CIS it was positive low single digits, so, having CIS be neutral will be a significant improvement for our total European results and I think it would imply an ability to grow organically again in Europe.  So, I think your thesis there is probably right.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "And then last question just on the acquisition pipeline, obviously a dearth of deals here, just probably more on the target side not wanting to sell at a bottom or something, but now that the economy seems to have picked up a little bit and at least public company valuations are back up to somewhat respectable levels, do you think that will be here on the target side of not wanting to sell at a bottom and staring to ease out at all of these deals?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "It\u2019s always hard to predict and particularly predict timing on these sorts of deals.  We have seen a couple deals done and one in particular on the equipment side of the business but we don\u2019t participate in that side of the business, but I think as an indicator that maybe things are starting to move a little bit and we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll get to participate in that industry consolidation, although again it is difficult to predict timing.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Can you qualify your acquisition pipeline at all at this point, good, bad, and different relative to last few quarters?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "Good.", "Operator", "", "We will take our next question from Adam Prusard - Barclays Capital.", "Adam Prusard - Barclays Capital", "", "Just want to clarify on Q4, just thinking of US, I know obviously last year it kind of moved away from the historical trend, we saw revenues sequentially up from Q3, Q4, would you expect maybe that historical trend to return this year?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "I think there is a better opportunity for that; last year we had a number of things that were putting pressure on the US sales including the pre-buy which we\u2019ve already mentioned, we had a problem with our anesthetic stock last year which kind of took us out of that market for most of the fourth quarter actually, and given the fact that we feel like the economics underlying the dental market are going to be improving in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter or at least versus earlier in the year, and thus, I think there is a good opportunity that the historic trends might return.", "Adam Prusard - Barclays Capital", "", "Can you guys comment, are you seeing improvement in the small equipment side, what are you seeing there lately?", "Bret W. Wise", "Small equipment which was very negative in the first quarter kind of became neutral in the second quarter and I think it was neutral and maybe even slightly positive on the mix in the third quarters; so, that resistance to spend, most of our small equipment is $5000 or less kind of things you\u2019d buy with the credit card, the reluctance to even spend that amount which we saw early in the year first quarter seems to have abated a bit.", "Adam Prusard - Barclays Capital", "", "So, consistent with other segments, you\u2019ve definitely seen some improvement there?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "Yes, we have.", "Adam Prusard - Barclays Capital", "", "And then, a bigger picture Bret, now you have over 300 in cash on your balance sheet, just remind me kind of what your priorities are, acquisitions, buy-backs, or increase in the dividends, just your thoughts there?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "Actually you\u2019ve got the order right.  Our priority would be to reinvest in the business, either acquisitions or R&D, sales and marketing; secondly for share repurchases; and third would be the dividend.", "Adam Prusard - Barclays Capital", "", "And lastly, just a quick one for Bill, if we were to see currency to stay where it is, what would you estimate the currency contribution would be for the fourth quarter to earnings?", "William R. Jellison", "We don\u2019t specifically talk about the earnings side of the equation, but I think what you should be expecting, if rates are staying kind of where they\u2019re at right now that you\u2019ve probably got a top-size that\u2019s probably in the 4% to 6% range positive instead of negative.", "Operator", "", "We will take our next question from Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "", "Following on that foreign exchange commentary there, what kind of impact did FX have on your earnings in the third quarter?", "William R. Jellison", "", "Overall, on a broad basis, it was actually fairly flat including the translation and some of the transaction related sides of the equation offset a little bit by the net investment hedge slops that we\u2019ve got out there; so, while we\u2019d have probably more of a drag in the first part of this year, it actually became more neutral in the third quarter.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "", "And with the number of selling days equal this third quarter versus the last and what does it look like for the fourth quarter?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "They were flat in Q3 and will be flat in Q4.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "And do you anticipate any additional restructuring charges coming up?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "We do expect to have some modest restructuring charges over the next let\u2019s say 5 quarters or so and they\u2019re probably in line with the kind of size and magnitude that you\u2019ve seen from us thus far.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "", "And I noticed that your goodwill account was up about $40 million sequentially, can you discuss the reasons behind that?", "William R. Jellison", "", "I think that one of the things that you got to look at between the numbers you\u2019re looking at there between December of 2008 and now is about 3 to 4 percentage point of that increase is all FX.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "", "Bill, I think you had mentioned that your inventory was down, but I\u2019m showing a $312 million versus $279, am I looking at something incorrectly?", "William R. Jellison", "", "Again you\u2019ve got to take a look at the FX related aspect of it; on a constant currency basis it\u2019s down and you\u2019ll see it on our cash flow statement as well too that we\u2019ve got about $8 million of a reduction in the quarter in comparison to a bill last year of around 15.25.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "", "And is that the same case for receivables, the FX having an impact there?", "William R.

Most of those balance sheet items are impacted by somewhere in the 3% to 4% range from the end of the year until the end of third quarter.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "", "And would that be true somewhat for cash and debt also?", "William R. Jellison", "", "Yes, it would absolutely be true for cash and a little bit on the debt side, not as much.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Chris Arndt - Select Equity Group.", "Chris Arndt - Select Equity Group", "", "I think you mentioned in the quarter that the mix shift was negative, but you also mentioned that implants were flat and I thought you mentioned that endodontics and orthodontics were also reasonably good, so I just want to reconcile those two facts; if something was negative on the mix side, what was negative?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "Keep in mind instead of implants and endo growing significantly faster generally than our broader-based market and product lines by having it be flat that\u2019s actually putting a negative drag on the overall mix; we\u2019ve also got mix within some of our product line related categories as well too; for example, sales in the Russia areas are down in comparison to some of the other regions and then also Spain which has an unemployment rate of close to around 20% right now, actually has a higher margin level for us and those sales are also down.", "Chris Arndt - Select Equity Group", "", "And then, I\u2019m sorry if I didn\u2019t hear this correctly, but in terms of the internal growth numbers and you said 2.5% ex-foreign currency, ex-precious metals, and then the acquisition contribution was 4 percentage points, is that right?", "Bret W. Wise", "", "That\u2019s right.", "Chris Arndt - Select Equity Group", "", "Okay, so organic growth you could say is negative 1.5%?", "Bret W.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Bret Wise, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Bret Wise", "Thank you, Missy, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter call. This is Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and also with us today are Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Jellison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Each of the three of us some prepared remarks today, we are going to comment on the state of the market in late 2009 and how we see it going into 2010. And of course, we're going to cover in some detail our fourth quarter 2009 performance as well as full year 2009 performance. And as usual following our formal remarks, we'll be pleased to answer any questions you may have.", "Before we get started, it is important to note that this conference call will in fact include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties, and those should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and the uncertainties described in the company\u2019s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly filings on Form 10-Q as well as our press releases and other filings with the SEC.", "It\u2019s important to note that the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. And as usual a recording this conference call in its entirety will be available on our website.", "Last evening we were pleased to announce fourth quarter and full year earnings. Our 2009 performance I think illustrates DENTSPLY\u2019s ability to deliver consistent performance throughout economic cycle. We achieved solid results in a very challenging market largely due to efforts to balance our continued investment in growth prospects, but also a rapid reduction in our non-essential discretionary expenses. On balance, I think we did a good job of controlling cost, taking market share in select markets and improving cash flows.", "Our fourth quarter results show some signs of market stabilizing and also even improving in certain markets. In total, the fourth quarter sales were up 11.3% ex precious metals and that was driven by constant currency growth of 5.7%, and a currency benefit of 5.6%. The constant currency growth of 5.7 included internal growth of a positive 0.6% and acquisition growth of 5.1%. Looking at just the dental business excluding our non-dental businesses, the internal growth would have been 1.3%.", "I think it\u2019s important to note that this is the first positive internal growth we have seen since Q3 of 2008, and although we are -- need your confident the fourth quarter we nevertheless view the positive growth as reflective or perhaps a modest improvement in select markets and summary terms of the growth. The dental internal growth was driven by positive growth in our consumable lines and our specialty products in total, which were both positive during the quarter. The prosthetics business continues to lag and had negative internal growth in the quarter.", "I think there are a couple of important messages here. One is that, consumable growth appears to be coming back the fastest in the market, and while we recognize there is a low base here comparison for consumables particularly in the US, this growth is a good indicator that everyday dentistry has been performed at a slightly higher pace, and I think it\u2019s probably also an indicator that we are taking share in some of these broad categories. The specialties which we continue to experience positive internal growth in implants and orthodontics and just slightly negative internal growth in endodontics has held up pretty well throughout the recession. I think it\u2019s important to note that our specialty business in the aggregate have reported positive internal growth in all four quarters of 2009.", "And although they are not really growing rapidly at this point, they appear to be holding their own in a slow growth pattern, and given the growth that we\u2019ve experienced in these categories, we believe that we continue to outperform the market and take share. The prosthetics market that, that\u2019s the product that are sold primarily to the dental lab continues to be the most economically sensitive as these procedures generally come at a high cost, they are somewhat discretionary and deferrable. This market continues to contract and we don\u2019t see any meaningful signs of recovery in either the US or Europe at this point.", "Our geographic growth was much improved in the US with internal growth of 3.0% in total and 4.2% for the dental business, while Europe was a negative 3.5% in total and rest of the world was positive 4.9%. Couple of observations, the US dental growth reflects chair-side consumable internal growth in the double-digits, and that was aided by an easier comp from the prior, adjusting for our best guess that what really changes in dealer inventory this year versus last, and also for anesthetic product outage last year. We think we probably grew 1% to 2% in consumables in the quarter, and we believe that\u2019s probably more reflective of market growth or perhaps just above market.", "Our specialty products in the US continue to grow in the 2% to 3% range this quarter, which is a slight pickup. There also was off at lower comp in the prior year quarter but probably also above market. And lastly the prosthetics business in the US experienced a double-digit decline in the quarter where in the prior year it was essentially flat, and actually reflects probably unfavorable changes in dealer inventories this year compared to last year.", "After [ph] the changes in the dealer inventory we believe the prosthetics business would have been down probably mid single digit. Europe also showed growth in consumables and implants in the quarter but to the extent we have seen in the US, well lab results were negative in Europe. Just a reminder that Europe was still growing in the 3% to 4% range in the fourth quarter of last year\u2019s, so this a region where we are actually up against tougher comps in the prior year.", "At this point it\u2019s evident to us that US market is likely to recover first, and with the economic trends in the earliest stimulus that was applied in the US, we believe it will emerge and begin to grow earlier and perhaps faster than Europe, which of course, enters the recession later and had less stimulus to exit the year, the recession at this point.", "In the rest of world categories, usual to mix bag, however, we saw particular strong or improving growth in Latin America, Canada, Japan and Australia. Overall, a positive trend seems to be developing in numerous regions.", "On the earnings side, we produced $0.50 per diluted share in the quarter on a GAAP reported basis and $0.48 on a non-GAAP basis or 6.7% improvement on a non-GAAP basis, and this was in fact a record fourth quarter for the company on an earnings basis.", "Bill will speak more to the components, but at a high level, we did continue to experience gross margin contractions this quarter as we brought inventories down. However, I feel that we are probably getting closer to a point where we need to be on inventory and I would now expect production in the quarter to return to match closer to demand levels, and this should give us some relief from the cost absorption issues that we face for a couple of quarters and allow some sequential improvement in gross margins as we enter 2010.", "For the full year 2009, our net sales decreased slightly by 1.5%. That includes precious metals. Excluding precious metals, it was basically flat. It was down one-tenth of 1% versus the record revenue that we recorded in 2008. Internal growth was negative for the quarter at negative, excuse me, for the year ahead a negative 2.2 in total and a negative 1.3 for our dental business.", "While both these measures are probably the lowest, we have seen amidst many years, we do think we weathered an extraordinary economic contraction and outperformed many other companies in and outside of the dental industry. Our acquisition growth for the year was 4.5%, which allowed us to report positive constant currency growth of 2.3% for the full year. Our currency translation was a big headwind for us in 2009; it reduced our sales by 2.4%, which in turn pulled our overall sales for the year to just slightly likely below the 2008 level. In 2010, we initially had expected some relief from currency; however, the dollar has strengthened really remarkably in the past ten days, such that if rates remained where they are today, we in fact would face a small headwind in 2010.", "Putting the full year in perspective, sales in 2009 were essentially flat for 2008 and earnings on a non-GAAP basis declined just 2.1% compared with our all-time record of sales and earnings in 2008, and this is despite what turned out to be a very deep recession and a very negative currency environment for us. One last comment on 2009, we did produce very strong cash flow in the year or it was up close to 8% for the full year. During the fourth quarter, we did step-up our share repurchase program and expect to have additional activity in this area in 2010. As we said before, business development or acquisition is our primary use for free cash flow, and we hope to see that be more active in 2010.", "Early in the year we have completed one small transaction and we\u2019ve signed another that we expect to close here in the first quarter. We entered 2010 with a very strong balance sheet and are well-positioned to take advantage of those opportunities if they arise. Looking forward the rate of any economic recovery I guess still remained uncertain, and we\u2019ll likely develop that at very different paces depending on the region. At this point we feel the markets are gradually recovering in the US with the possible exception of prosthetics, which we mentioned here this morning.", "And the markets in Europe are not consistently recovering at this point but very greatly by country and the rest of world category, of course, is mixed. Chris, I have asked Chris to speak more to the developing growth trends that we see in the markets when he gets his prepared remarks in the few minutes.", "Overall 2010, we do expect to have positive internal growth probably in the low-single digit range, given the outlook for economic growth in employment levels. In addition, currently at this point it looks like it could be a modest headwind for 2010 if rates remain where they are today. For our own internal planning purposes, we are considering European currency rates to be comparable in 2010 to what we saw for the full year 2009, which would require the dollar to weaken just a bit from where it is today.", "Our earnings outlook is likewise influenced by the dramatic strengthening the dollar in the last week to 10 days. Given the strengthening, we have moved our currency assumptions to be neutral with 2010 as I\u2019ve mentioned, and also adjusted our internal outlook on earnings down by $0.02 a share at both the high-end and the low-end of the range to reflect this currency -- this change in the currency environment.", "Accordingly, we are initiating our earnings guidance at $1.90 to $2 per share for all of 2010. Again, this reflects our beliefs that the markets are beginning to improve, but on a gradual basis that we\u2019ll return to a positive internal growth in 2010, and that European currencies will essentially be neutral with the dollar in 2010 compared to 2009.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I would like to now turn the call over to Chris Clark who will discuss our market developments further. Chris?", "Chris Clark", "Thank you, Bret. Good morning, everyone. As Bret mentioned, we\u2019re beginning to see some signs of stabilization or a slight improvement in certain market segments and geographies. I would like to take just a few moments to provide some additional perspective to some of the trends that we are seeing. As we look at the various markets, it appears that consumable growth may be coming back the fastest. While we were helped by some favorable prior-year comparisons, our consumable business is showing some degree of gradual strengthening over the past two quarters, particularly in the US. The European consumable market appears to be less uniform thus far in its recovery.", "We do believe that conditions in UK, France, Italy and Germany as a whole are generally consistent with what we are seeing in the US. But Spain, CIS including Russia and Eastern Europe continue to face very difficult market conditions due to particularly weak local economies, high unemployment levels, and in some cases continued weak currencies.", "We did see some improvements in CIS in the quarter as demand appears to have improved a bit sequentially. One encouraging sign in the quarter as well on the consumable front was a solid improvement on our small equipment product lines indicating that dentists maybe feeling a little more confident and willing to invest a bit more proactively in these types of products. We do believe as a whole we gained market share in the global consumable market during 2009.", "As Bret mentioned, our specialties business continues to experience positive growth as a whole, and we believe that we are outperforming market here as well. We don\u2019t see any significant change in the global demand for implants, which we believe are still down mid single-digit. Although we continue to outpace the growth rate of most of our competitors and grew internally once again in the quarter.", "We are particularly gaining ground in the US behind investments we\u2019ve made to the US implant businesses over the last few years. We believe the global endodontic market to be down slightly, although this is probably an area that somewhat less impacted by the economy, at least so far as treatment of symptomatic cases.", "On the orthodontic side, although we believe the global ortho market is probably flat at best, we continue to post positive internal growth. And for the year we saw a stronger orthodontic market in Europe as supposed in the US due largely due to differences in reimbursement coverages.", "Regarding the lab business, this area remains most negatively impacted by the economy, and as Bret mentioned we\u2019re really not seeing any noticeable improvement in market conditions, thus far. The removable or denture segment of the lab business continues to be more stable at an end user demand level compared to the fixed segment of crown and bridge, which is facing particular pressure from lower cost clinical alternatives to the traditional solutions of precious metal framework or ceramic restoration. Unlike the consumable side, we don\u2019t see any appreciable improvement in the willingness or lapse at this point to invest in equipment.", "From a geographic standpoint, I also want to briefly touch on two other areas where we believe our performance continues to solidly outpace market growth. While the Australian dental market probably helps around better than most other developed markets in 2009, we are particularly pleased with our double-digit internal growth performance there, and we do believe that to be well above market growth. In Japan, while its slightly negative internal growth for the year, indications are there that we outpaced market in Japan by at least five points, again, indicating that we should be making solid market share improvement.", "We are particularly encouraged by the Japanese performance in light of the significant decline of the private market in Japan, which includes most of the specialty businesses that have been accretive to our growth rate there for the last several years.", "I now would like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison, who will cover the financial results for the fourth quarter in 2009 in greater detail. Bill?", "Bill Jellison", "Thanks, Chris. Good morning everyone. As Bret mentioned, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased by 11.9%, and net sales excluding precious metals content increased to 11.3% in the quarter with internal growth of positive 0.6% in the period.", "Net sales for the full year were 2.2 billion, a decrease of 1.5% over last year or net sales ex precious metals were $2 billion, virtually flat for the year. The 2009, geographic mix of sales without precious metal content was as follows", "The US represents 38% of sales, Europe was 41% this year, and the rest of the world was 21% of sales. Gross margins for the fourth quarter were 54.7% of sales ex-precious metals or a decrease of 3.3 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.", "Gross margins were negatively impacted this quarter by the roll off of the higher cost captured in our inventory last quarter. They were also negatively impacted by unfavorable mix in the period, especially of products within the product category, and by unabsorbed overhead costs as inventories were brought down an additional seven days in the quarter compared to building them by six days in the fourth quarter of 2008.", "Although the lower volume driven in part by our inventory reductions were a drag on margins in the latter half of 2009, we should see the cost structure begin to improve sequentially as move into 2010 as production more closely matches sell-through of our products. Full year gross margins were 55.8% ex-precious metals compared to 57.8% last year. Negative product mix, FX and under-absorbed operating cost were the biggest contributors offset somewhat by improved pricing in the year.", "SG&A expenses were $180 million or 34.6% sales ex-precious metals in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus 37.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008. SG&A expenses continued to show improvement compared to last year, both for the quarter and also for the full year. These expenses were not only lower than those in last year\u2019s fourth quarter on a constant dollar basis despite acquisitions, but they were also lower when measured as a percent of sales.", "Expenses continued to be tightly controlled in many areas as we worked to not only bring down discretionary costs, but also to reduce various fixed expenses to maintain an appropriate balance, while at the same time making some key investments to drive future growth.", "Total year SG&A was $723.2 million or 36.3% of sales ex-precious metals in 2009, versus 37.1% in 2008. Operating margins were 18.2% including restructuring and other expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating margins were 19.9% on sales ex-precious metals in the fourth quarter of 2009, and 18.3% in the same period last year including restructuring, impairments and other charges.", "Operating margins, ex-precious metals on a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring, impairments and other charges in both periods were 20.1% for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to 20.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008.", "Full year operating margins were 19.1% on sales ex-precious metals in 2009, and 19.1% in 2008. Operating margins on sales ex-precious metals on a non-GAAP basis excluding restructuring, impairments and other charges were 19.7% in 2009 compared to 20.7% in 2008.", "Net interest and other expense in the fourth quarter was $4 million or $6.6 million lower than last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Interest expense was $0.2 million lower in the quarter than last year, and FX transaction losses and other expenses were $6.4 million lower in the quarter compared to the same period last year, as last year was negatively impacted by the volatility in foreign exchange rates in the period.", "Net interest and other expense for the full year was $17.8 million or an expense reduction of $7.7 million for the year. Net interest expense was 16.8 million in 2009 compared to net interest expense of $15.4 million in 2008 or an increase of $1.4 million. Although, interest expense was lower in 2009, the low interest rate and invested cash caused net interest expense to increase during the year.", "The impact of foreign exchange transaction losses and other items in 2009 was an expense of $1 million in 2009 versus an expense of $10.1 million in 2008 or an expense reduction of $9.1 million. This primarily related to the significant foreign exchange transaction losses that occurred in the back half of 2008.", "The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23.5% compared to 5.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008. However, the operational tax rate in these periods were 26.9% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 22% in the fourth quarter of 2008. The 2009 full year tax rate of 24.5% included an operational rate of 26.1% compared to 25.9% in 2008. You should note that while the FX transaction impact was favorable in the fourth quarter, the negative impact of our operational tax rate nearly offset this benefit in this period.", "To better understand and follow some of the following comments, you can look at the tables included in our recent press release which reconciles performance from US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP performance.", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $75 million or $0.50 per diluted share compared to $71 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008. On an adjusted basis, earnings excluding restructuring, impairments and other related items and tax adjustments in both periods which constitute a non-GAAP measure were $72.6 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $67.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of 6.7% in diluted earnings per share.", "Net income attributable DENTSPLY International in 2009 for the full year was $274.4 million or $1.83 per diluted share. Net income for 2008 was $283.9 million or $1.87 per diluted share. Net income for comparability purposes on a non-GAAP basis excluding the reconciling items in the press release for the years ending 2009 and 2008 were $275.7 million and $285.5 million respectively. This represents earnings of $1.84 per diluted share for 2009 compared to $1.88 in 2008, a decrease of 2.1% for the year.", "In looking at our cash flow and some balance sheet related items, our operating cash flow was $117 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating cash flows for the year were approximately $362 million compared to $336 million in 2008.", "Capital expenditures were $56 million for the year with depreciation and amortization for the year totaling $65 million. Inventory days ended the year at 99 days for 2009 yearend versus 103 days last year or in 2008. In the first half of the year, inventories crept up, production levels weren\u2019t cutback as quickly as a falloff in sales. However, in the last half of the year, inventory levels were reduced by 11 days as specific actions were taken to get inventories back in line.", "Receivable days ended 2009 at 55 days compared to 61 days at the end of the third quarter of 2009, and 54 days at the end of 2008. We were very pleased with the significant improvement we saw from both our collection efforts and the improved liquidity of our customers that they experienced in the fourth quarter.", "This along with the further assessment of our bad debt reserve and specific receivable write-offs allowed us to have a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts in the period. We are hopeful that these improvements will continue as global liquidity continues to improve as we move through 2010. The balance sheet has strengthened even further during 2009 and end the year in very good shape. The year ended with $450 million in cash and short-term investments with total debt of $470 million at the end of 2009.", "DENTSPLY repurchased 2.5 million shares for $79 million in 2009 based on the company\u2019s authorization to maintain up to 17 million shares of treasury stock, we still have approximately 1.2 million shares available for repurchase. We have repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares in the fourth quarter and expect to continue to have some additional share repurchased in 2010. We continue to monitor both the market\u2019s liquidity and our investment needs in making these decisions.", "In looking at 2009, we believe currency translation impacts at current foreign exchange rate should have a slightly negative sales and earnings impact for the year, and the recent volatility in these markets make it even more difficult to predict.", "Our guidance is based on a slightly weaker dollar at levels closer to 2009 average exchange rates. We are also facing SG&A headwinds north of a half of percentage point of sales as commission expenses, bonuses and customer rebate levels are reset to reflect the more normalized budget. We are anticipating some improvements in gross profit margins during the year, which will also help to offset some, if not more than offset, the SG&A headwinds.", "Global economic markets are also beginning to show signs of improvement and we are hopeful that the improvement will continue. We believe, as the global economies improve, the global dental market will also be able to return to positive growth once again in 2010.", "As Bret stated, our guidance for earnings in 2010 is in the range of $1.90 to $2 per diluted share. This excludes restructuring and other costs and income tax related adjustments. While we will be focused on sales growth and gross profit margin improvements for the year, we are also confident of our position in the market and we will continue to make investments to support our business as well as for our future sales and earnings growth.", "That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first next question from Derek Leckow with Barrington Research. Please go ahead.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Thank you, good morning everybody.", "Bret Wise", "Good morning.", "Bill Jellison", "Good morning.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "On the comments, Bret, about the internal growth rate in dental 1.3% positive, later on you said that the chair-side consumables were up in double-digits, and grew I think 1% to 2% if you excluded something unusual in there. Can you explain that a little bit better?", "Bret Wise", "Sure, Derek. What I was trying to \u2013 give you some background on it. As you might remember last year in the fourth quarter \u2013 going into the fourth quarter actually last year, at the end of the third quarter, we implemented some price increases that were above kind of our historic norm.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Okay.", "Bret Wise", "And that pulled product into Q3 last year and out of Q4 last year. So we created kind of a low base for Q4 last year. And the second issue was, at the end of the third quarter last year, we warned that we\u2019re suffering an outage at our manufacture for dental anesthetics in US, it suffered a plant outage, and that we would be out of the market in the fourth quarter for anesthetics, and that in fact happened. So last year\u2019s internal growth rate for consumables, which is the two, the categories affected by both of those items was artificially low. And that causes the comparison this year to be artificially high. So we were trying to reconcile that down for you, for purposes of understanding the mid-teens type consumable growth for us this year.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Okay.", "Bret Wise", "I think what I would add to that, and perhaps, I should have that in our prepared remarks was, when we were exiting third quarter we had told you that the same circumstance had caused third quarter\u2019s internal growth to be low by about half a point to a point; this is for 2009 growth. It has the counter effect on Q4, meaning our worldwide growth was probably helped by half a point to a point because of the circumstances, and that\u2019s the background I was trying to give you.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "I think you characterized as being sort of a return to normalized levels of inventory in the channel as opposed to being something that may have brought in any revenue from Q1?", "Bret Wise", "Yes, that\u2019s true.", "Bill Jellison", "Correct.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Okay, good, I understand that. And then just to take look at the gross margin contractions, what percentage of that change would be, or how many basis points were attributable to the under-absorption issue?", "Bret Wise", "I may let Bill address that, but first I like to have an overview comment on that.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Okay", "Bret Wise", "Just to make sure everyone is clearly, we saw, when we entered the recession late last year, early this year, we saw inventories rise pretty dramatically in Q4 of 2008 and Q1 of 2009. So, that created -- that bubble in inventory of course, created excess absorption in our costs, I mean it improved our cost last year. This year in the third quarter we brought inventories down by, I don\u2019t know the exact amount, four or five days, and some of those costs were hung up, that under absorption was hung up in inventory cost at the end of the third quarter.", "In the fourth quarter we brought them down another seven days and none of those costs are hung up in inventory at the end of the fourth quarter. So, in the fourth quarter, we took that absorption hit for both the inventory reduction in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, compared to building inventory in the prior year. So, I think that\u2019s the overview kind of, Bill can you give more on the specifics.", "Bill Jellison", "That\u2019s exactly correct on the swing in the production levels, which makes a big difference and how we are absorbing the overhead in those products, but the impact specifically in the fourth quarter was about 170 basis points of that margin change.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Okay, understood. And then going into next year, you are looking for improvement, I guess that improvement would begin at the beginning of the year, right? It wouldn\u2019t necessarily be something that creeps up throughout the year or is that \u2013 is a fair way to look at that?", "Bret Wise", "I think generally, yes. I mean, we believe that we should be able to run the plants now to meet demand, not lower than demand levels. That should give us improved margins as we enter 2010.", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, I think sequentially you\u2019ll see some of that, Derek, between the fourth quarter and first quarter, although on a year-over-year comparison you won't see as much of that really until the back half of the year.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "All right. And then as I can look at the guidance, the comments that you made of, what are you assuming in there for interest and other expense, if you could help us with that line? And that as well you are going to be buying back more stocks, it looks like with that cash balance where it is and maybe you want to comment on what you are assuming for deal. I don\u2019t think normally you don\u2019t give guidance on what you assume for acquisition activity but those numbers are really just the internal growth expectations, right.", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, I mean, in our guidance we don\u2019t anticipate any M&A activity that hasn\u2019t occurred, and likewise our guidance, we do have an authorization for stock buybacks right now, I think that there is 1.2 million left in it, but it doesn\u2019t contemplate in the share repurchases beyond that.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "So, I should kind of assume 149 kind of shares outstanding for next \u2013 for 2010?", "Bill Jellison", "I think that part of that\u2019s depending on obviously what add to the stock price because the dilution of it, but yes that's at least reasonable in the range.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "And the interest and other expense line would that to be kind of --?", "Bill Jellison", "In the interest and other expense line, Derek, we really don\u2019t give specific guidance associated with that obviously. We are expecting to generate enough significant amount of cash again this year. It depends on how we deploy that cash whether in acquisitions or stocks buybacks, but it also \u2013 it\u2019s obviously highly dependent upon where those interest rates go, I mean, that was one of the biggest negative impacts in 2009 for us, was that at the beginning of the year we were making over 3% at our interest income from our investments and by the end of the year we were making about 20 basis points.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "But the biggest one factor this year probably the currency and that\u2019s the part I am having trouble \u2013", "Bret Wise", "Yes. And on that category though Derek, just like for us, swings on the currency if within that category of line is only the difference in transactions that are occurring in that period and the volatility that occurs specifically within that quarter. So, even in our forecasting we generally forecast that to be zero or flat because literally it could move in either a positive or negative direction within the specific quarter.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Okay. All right, thank you very much, guys. I appreciate it.", "Chris Clark", "Thanks. You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird & Co. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Thank you. Good morning, guys.", "Bret Wise", "Hey, good morning.", "Chris Clark", "Hey, good morning.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Wondering at first Bret, if we can just focus on some of the strategic investments, I am sure you don\u2019t want to tip your hand too much, but you know what it is, one of the reasons you are talking about guidance where it is, and just wondering if you can provide any more color around those investments?", "Bret Wise", "I will give you a little bit, but not much. We have been focused on two areas, one is enhanced R&D investments in certain businesses, which we began implementing last year and going into 2010 we expect to be a little bit higher. And secondly, we did initiate a sales force expansion in one of our businesses in the fourth quarter, which we kind of gave you heads-up to going when we exited the third quarter and that sales force expansion is pretty much in place now, and there will be some more additional marketing expenses behind it here in 2010. So I think its two areas, its R&D and it\u2019s the sales force expansion.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "And Bret, I think that sale force expansion was in the dental implant areas, is that correct or can you talk about that?", "Bret Wise", "We haven\u2019t given any guidance as to where that expansion took place.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "All right, fair enough. And then acquisition growth a little higher in the quarter, I'm assuming that wasn\u2019t just a huge pick-up in Dermac [ph] or something, was there a deal in Q4 that actually contributed to the number?", "Bret Wise", "No. I think what's \u2013 the 5.1% acquisition growth in the fourth quarter was driven by the businesses that we have bought performed really well. So, we don\u2019t count the organic growth that happens in an acquisition in the first year as organic growth, we count it as acquisition growth. But I think that\u2019s an indicator to you that those, the acquisitions performed pretty well here in the fourth quarter.", "And the other indicator, of course, would be the line in the income statement where we back out the income attributable to the \u2013 but we own less than a 100%, we back out the income that\u2019s attributable to the minority interest.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Yes, now I got you. On the Dermac [ph] side, did that at all then contribute a little bit to the gross margin pressure as well in the quarter?", "Bret Wise", "Yes, it did \u2013 it hadn\u2019t anniversaried yet, so it\u2019s \u2013 but it's now anniversary and it won't contribute to it anymore presumably.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Yes. And Bill, I guess, you can help me out on that point, then just if a 170 BPs in the quarter was lack of overhead absorption on the inventory side, how much was mix at least in deals that have now anniversaried?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, on deals that are anniversaried, it's been an impact of around, just under half a percentage point. Keep in mind, that those acquisitions are still obviously in our numbers moving forward, it's just not a reduction of a comparable.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay, that\u2019s fair. So don\u2019t necessarily add the 170 and the 50 together and assume sequentially you go up 220 BPs?", "Bill Jellison", "Correct, correct, yes. For those period sequentially, that\u2019s right.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Yes. Now fair enough, but I guess the gross margin comment that I am a still little uncertain on, the point that I am uncertain on, why did the Q3 lack of overhead absorption in inventory rolled into Q4, but then the Q4 lack of overhead absorption rolled into Q4 as well, just was it -- can you explain that timing issue a little bit more?", "Bill Jellison", "Sure. It\u2019s really based on the size and the impacts of those activities, in fact, and if you looked at the third quarter some of the cost that were being under-absorbed and the higher expense levels within that period still hit the third quarter, just that because of the magnitude that carried over some into the fourth quarter and rolled up with the inventory, wherein this quarter the majority of it had actually occurred within the third quarter and some also within the fourth quarter, but by time, that inventory rolled of, it still followed into the first quarter period, it didn\u2019t impact the first quarter.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay. Great. And then last couple of questions here, just your European comp turns was about 7.30, so here in Q1 of \u201810 you go from plus 4% in Q4 \u201808 to minus 3 plus percent in Q1 of \u201809 as you will remember. We are lapping kind of the 20% down Russia and Spain type performances and things like that, so is there a reason to believe we at least get back to kind of the even, if not slight growth in Europe early in 2010, or is that geographic to be thinking at this point?", "Bill Jellison", "I think Europe is -- our visibility in Europe is much less than our visibility in United States. There is a lot of things happening there today even about how they are going to deal with the currency issues across some of these countries that are still facing a pretty substantial crisis, and there was news out this morning about some helping out Greece.", "I think in the developed part of Europe, we got -- we have more visibility and Chris commented that there appears to be some signs of improvement there as well, but in the countries like that you have mentioned, the old CIF countries, Spain, Greece, to a lesser extent Italy, there is still a lot of uncertainty. One thing is certain and that is that the negative that we had last year in some of those countries may become neutral now. It may not improve but it may be neutral with the comparison, and by eliminating that negative it could have a positive impact on our growth in the region.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Great, and remind me, Bret, those areas account for maybe in the ballpark of 15% of Europe?", "Bret Wise", "They\u2019ll obtain 10% to 15% probably.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "10% to 15% of it, fair enough. And last question then just for Bill, the sales percentages by geography, I know you provided for 2009, could you provide just the Q4s, and also just what tax rate on an operational basis should be in 2010? Thanks.", "Bill Jellison", "You are talking about the geographic mix, I\u2019m sorry in the fourth quarter, is it so Jeff?", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Yes, I know you provided it for the year but I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to have to do the math.", "Bill Jellison", "Sure, no problem. In the United States, it was actually up just under 32% for the quarter. Europe was actually stronger 44.3%, and the rest of the world is 23.6%.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "And that\u2019s on a reported basis, right?", "Bill Jellison", "That\u2019s on a ex-precious metal.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Ex-P.M. but reported, so currency is what helped Europe go up there I am assuming.", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay, and then just operational pact rate [ph] for 2010?", "Bill Jellison", "And we haven't \u2013 kind of stage at what that is, but I think that\u2019s reasonable to assume that the rate should probably stay in the same kind of range as 2009.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "All right, great. Thanks guys.", "Bret Wise", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Natalie Nadler \u2013 William Blair", "Hi, thanks. It\u2019s actually Natalie Nadler, in for John today. I was hoping that you could talk some more about what you are hearing from your sales force on piece and traffic turns in dental offices these days, and if you are seeing any changes there?", "Chris Clark", "Natalie, it\u2019s Chris. I would characterize it as a mix bag overall, maybe up slightly. I don\u2019t think we have seen any hugely appreciable change, but I guess, I would say that the US consumables market -- consumables market in general would probably be the best parameter of that in terms of just general traffic flow. Obviously, we are feeling a little bit more positive about that trends in that segment. So I would say, maybe slightly up.", "Natalie Nadler \u2013 William Blair", "Okay, great. And then Bill, I know you typically target 20 to 50 basis points of improvement in operating margin, is that still in your guidance for 2010?", "Bill Jellison", "As we\u2019ve talked about, one, we don\u2019t give specific guidance on the margin side of the equation year-over-year, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that if you looked at the lower end of our range that\u2019s probably assuming very little, probably zero margin related improvements. But, if you go to the top end of the range it would absolutely include margin improvement.", "Natalie Nadler \u2013 William Blair", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Marsh, Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks and good morning. Maybe if I could, elaborate a little bit on your working capital. Obviously you guys continue to do a great job in managing that, and it seems like the story for 2009 was really pulling down inventories to match demand. Sort of I want to make sure, if I heard it correctly, you were suggesting now with inventories, you think you are going to grow in line with revenues this year? And if so, then where else -- do you anticipate getting any other benefits on the working capital line anywhere else on your balance sheet?", "Bill Jellison", "Larry, this is Bill Jellison. I think that it's fair to say that our expectations as we mentioned on the inventory side is that we are expecting inventories to track more in line with what our sell-through level is on the products. We probably have a slight improvement expected on the inventory side, maybe a day or two but not a lot in comparison to the 2009 numbers. As far as account receivables are concerned, I\u2019d say that we believe they are in very, very good shape right now, even in this type of market. And I would probably not expect much improvement, maybe a day, we don\u2019t see any deterioration but there probably wouldn\u2019t be much of improvement of at the level that existed at the end of the year.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Got it. So then, Bill, remind me what you had said on that CapEx for this year target?", "Bill Jellison", "CapEx for 2010?", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Yes.", "Bill Jellison", "For 2010, I mean, keep in mind that 2009 we were down significantly obviously because of the lower volume levels at 56. I think it's fair to assume that our CapEx would probably rebound up to more of a normalized level probably in kind of that mid 70-ish kind of range in comparison to what it had been in the past.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Right. So, I guess the message is, I mean given even with a challenge of free cash flow this past year was up quite nicely. So, it sounds like just on the free cash flow line given big boost in CapEx and little less benefit on inventories you would anticipate free cash flow were to be flat to down versus '09?", "Bill Jellison", "Well, I think it's fair to say that the swing on the CapEx side would absolutely have an impact on the free cash flow, and that's probably a reasonable assumption is right in that range. Although, the expectation on both the earnings side as well as some of our other management related activities will contribute to drive that cash. But I think that it\u2019s fair to assume kind of in the assumption that you are looking at there.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, second question on, sort of tax rate, I know you -- to just question you had said about \u2013 assume about the same level this year than last year, but as far as you think about the next couple of years, I just kind of confirm is your -- are there additional opportunities in your view to bring that down or given the challenging global budget situations for most countries, that\u2019s going to a tougher road to hold?", "Chris Clark", "Well, I think that on our side of the equation that you know that is a key part of our general strategy, and it\u2019s been across the board, and we\u2019re driving that at each of our different divisions. So we would absolutely expect to still see some improvements over the next couple of years in those areas.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, that\u2019s consistent with what you said in the past. Second question, just to confirm what you had said, I mean, basically currency is a -- FX is a source of volatility and how you, sort of, think about guidance like you had said in your prepared comments just the strengthening dollar here in the last month pulled out a couple of sets in your range, I just want to make sure I heard that correctly? And then just besides the up ticks of translation, how well does volatility in currency markets, essential volatility specially versus EURO impacts your business as you plan 2010?", "Bret Wise", "Yes, Larry, let me take a stab at that and then I think Bill wants to revisit this last question on tax. What transpired was that the dollar, of course, had weakened pretty substantially against the euro and the Swiss francs up until about three or four weeks ago, and then just in the last week, I mean, it\u2019s kind of since last Friday the dollar dramatically strengthened against the euro in particular--", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Yes.", "Bret Wise", "And I would say that the comments in our prepared remarks were intended to let you know that if we were to had issued our guidance, let's say two weeks ago, it would have been higher than what it is today, meaning that dramatic change in the currency particularly against the euro but also to a lesser extent against the Swiss currency, drove us to lower our guidance a couple of cents on both the top end and the low end of the range. So, I guess for people that had issued their own guidance before that, they wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to take that into account, and we're trying to send you a signal now that needs to be taken into account.", "We don\u2019t try to predict currencies in our own guidance. I mean, we said this year we're going to kind of, we're assuming it\u2019s going to be kind of be neutral, European currencies against US currency, neutral in '010 versus '09, which would fire a slight weakening in the dollar, not a lot but just a little bit. But within our range of guidance the $1.90 to $2, of course, there is room in there for different levels of currency. There is room in there for different levels of internal growth, and as Bill said a moment ago, different levels of operating margin expansion.", "I'm going to let Bill now address kind of how you should understand what the movement in the currency would mean to us on the bottom line and then I think he wants to read us the tax question.", "Bill Jellison", "Sure. Just on the currency side of the equation, what we generally do is give a rough benchmark there that if currencies move across all currencies against the dollar in the same direction by about five percentage point. That probably has, obviously 60% of our business is international has a top line impact on us of about three percentage points plus or minus depending on the movement of the FX. And then, at the bottom line its probably has an impact of about a penny a share roughly per quarter impact for us.", "Now, again that\u2019s based on if all currencies are moving in the same direction, which is generally not the case, I mean, most recently you\u2019ve seen obviously moves with the yen strengthening against the dollar while some of the other currencies have actually weakened. Larry, just to also revisit one of your last questions, I was thinking you were still actually on working capital related activities over the next few years, I think your question actually was on the tax rate?", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Yes.", "Bret Wise", "And if that\u2019s the case we think then in 2010 we are still, as I mentioned to Jeff, we are still probably targeting a range that\u2019s similar to what we are in 2009. As you move beyond that, I think that a lot of it is still up in the year based on what both domestic tax related issues and changes will be especially as some of the things on the international related income from what the Obama administration has at least discussed or identified, and then also what a number of other municipalities both domestically as well as other international locations will in dealing with their funding related needs.", "Based on all of that, I would expect that our tax rate would definitely more than likely increase once we get past 2010, depending on what those changes really are.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "All right And then directionally, though I know since way far in the future, but when you sort of think about increases is that in the magnitude of 50 to 100 BPs or as you now think about your five-year plan, are you concerned that it could be -- you could be faced with a couple of hundred bops increasing your tax rate?", "Bret Wise", "Well, I think obviously some of the comments out of the Obama administration obviously are concerning to, I think, any international related company. But, there is a lot of issues around those discussions yet, a lot of negotiations that\u2019s going to take place. I don\u2019t know where those are ultimately going to end up, but you can be assured that we are already thinking on different concepts on what we need to be doing in light of some of that moving forward, and we\u2019ll try and do the most appropriate tax planning that we can in light of those changes.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Got it. Okay. And just to clarify, you $0.10 range in guidance obviously moving just in the last week because of currency, it sounds like some of that wide range \u2013 no I\u2019ll step back, a year ago you had a $0.10 range partly due the uncertainty in the economy, I mean this year your visibility of the economy is better, but it terms like you\u2019re signaling that the volatility and currency is still there, it\u2019s not potentially more volatile as you think about this year?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, although Larry, I think, although our visibility has improved but that\u2019s clearly true. It's not nearly back to what it was two three years ago, at this point.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Right.", "Bill Jellison", "I mean, there is still much uncertainty. So I think the $0.10 range on our part was due to some of the variables you mentioned there, but as well as it's just hard to predict a full year\u2019s result at this point to the level of accuracy that we think we could have done that a few years back.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, and then a final quick question. Japan, you mentioned you\u2019re taking share there, have you a sort of bracket Japan in terms of strength relative to say Europe and US? And then how do you think about the rest of Asia for a business, and remind us roughly speaking how much Asia is in terms of your total volume?", "Chris Clark", "Yeah, Larry, it's Chris. I think in terms of Japan, the market in Japan is in far worst shape from a market growth standpoint when you compare it to the US and to Europe. Mainly because the economy is not good at shape and as well the private sector in particular, which is approximately 20% of the market has been particularly hard hit. Despite that actually, as I mentioned we\u2019re pleased with our results there while we didn\u2019t grow internally and we are slightly negative. In fact, we were well better in the market and that\u2019s an area that we have continued to make some investments into, and continue to grow that business. We are pleased in general with how that\u2019s performing.", "In terms of Western Asia, I would say, west characterization has been kind of -- some of these western world\u2019s countries being -- regions being a mixed bag, I think, that\u2019s pretty indicative of the Asian areas as well. I think we have some countries where we had particularly strong performances. Taiwan for us was actually quite solid. India, we have some solid performance, but we have some as well that were challenging, aspects of the Korean business were challenging and aspects for China were challenging this past year.", "Asia as a group, just quickly looking at this -- it\u2019s about 5% of the overall business, ex-Japan. Japan is roughly -- it\u2019s about the same, so together about 10%.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Got it, okay. Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Green with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America", "Hi, thanks for the question. You said that seven days of inventory changes was worked around a 170 basis points of gross margin headwind, if I heard you correctly? Is that a reliable model to use going forward to think about the gross margin impact based on inventory changes?", "Chris Clark", "No, it\u2019s not. And that\u2019s because if you look at what took place in the fourth quarter is you not only had the impact of the fourth quarter itself, but you also had some of the carry-over impact from the third quarter. You also had it in comparison to periods the prior year that were actually building inventory. So, really we didn\u2019t like the fourth quarter, there was like about a 13 day swing factor between last year of our 2008 fourth quarter and 2009.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay, okay. And did you say in 2010, there would be a swing factor of a couple of days that I heard you right?", "Bret Wise", "We believe that, I think a reasonable, a slight improvement after those days, so flat to an improvement of one to two days I think is a reasonable assumption.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. Improvement going up so a GM [ph] tailwind or?", "Bret Wise", "No that's an improvement in reducing inventories.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. So there would be another slight headwind then.", "Bret Wise", "Slight, yes.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay.", "Bret Wise", "I think the way to think about that, Scott, is every year we have targets to reduce inventories, and this year 2009 was a little bit unusual in that, as the recession occurred inventory, we believe inventory got away from us a little bit in the fourth quarter of '08 and the first quarter of '09. And thus we had to struggle all year to bring it back down and we brought down dramatically in the back half of 2009. But any year we would have some goals to bring inventories down somewhat.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. Got it. And as I think about your guidance for internal growth, you said low single-digits. And in thinking about the industry model that suggest that the dental market grows a point or two faster than the economy, DENTSPLY typically a premium to that. So is it fair to say that you are suggesting economic growth of no better than flat if you are growing low single digits internally?", "Bret Wise", "No, I think the way you should think about that, and this is just a little perspective. Dentistry is usually a lagging indicator. We will go into a recession later than the rest of the economy, and typically become out of it later. In part that's due to the tie to employment levels, particularly here in the United States where you get your dental insurance from your job. So if you are unemployed you don\u2019t have dental insurance generally. So were little bit of a lagging indicator, but I think that we probably follow the same economist that you do, our expectation right now is that GDP in the US will probably in the two range and slightly lower in Europe at this point would be our overall economic assumptions.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay, and a question on implants, it seems like the industry participants were reporting somewhat wide range of a growth rates across the board, and I was wondering how sticky you believe your market share gains are in that segment given the complexity of the procedure. And I recall last June you hosted your first US implant Dental Symposium and I was curious what other initiatives you have lined up to build on your momentum there?", "Chris Clark", "Well, I think our improvement in implants is due to two things, one is we are investing in the business including sales and marketing resources, R&D etcetera, and second of all we got -- at least a really good platform in our two implant lines ankylosed and zybez [ph]. So we have been able to take share and I do believe it\u2019s pretty sticky. The larger one that we have this year is Barcelona in March where we are hosting our -- we do this every other year, our Global Implants Symposium. We expect it to be about 3000 surgeons at that meeting. So that\u2019s a large marketing form force for this year.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay and then one last question, on the share count you said around 149 million, I guess over the past couple of years before 2009 we were accustomed to seeing a 150 million or maybe a little more in share repurchase activity when you might have had a little lower cash balance, and we are still making acquisitions. So, has anything changed there in your capital deployment strategy or outlook?", "Chris Clark", "No, our priorities for cash deployment are acquisitions first. That could be companies or technologies. Second, it would be share repurchases, and third, we do have a modest dividend and we usually increase the dividend in line with earnings growth. And those priorities have remained the same.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. Thank you.", "Chris Clark", "Okay. Misty [ph] we are running a little long here. Why don\u2019t -- I think we have time for one more question from the field and then we will have to conclude.", "Operator", "Okay, absolutely. We'll take our last question from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead.", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Thanks for taking the question.", "Bret Wise", "Sure.", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "On the reimbursement front, I wonder if you could talk about any significant changes or potential changes globally, you may be monitoring for 2010.", "Bret Wise", "Sure. And of course this is a mix bag as you might expect. Of course, in our major markets in the US, we haven\u2019t seen companies really cutback on dental insurance a whole lot. So the trend there is that the people lose their jobs, they lose their insurance generally speaking. So I think there is a slight reduction in reimbursement in the US.", "In Europe and the major countries of Europe we have been pulling them, there is always a chance that you would see a reduction in reimbursement particularly if its government supplied reimbursement. Although the countries under the most pressure in Europe are not really government reimbursed. So at this point we don\u2019t expect any changes in Europe.", "The one area where we do expect to change is Japan, which frankly has some of the highest reimbursement rates in the world. And we\u2019ve become accustomed to the Japanese lowering their reimbursements slightly every couple of years. And at this point we think that they maybe due for another reduction in reimbursement. Historically, they have brought it down about 10 points when they do bring it down. This year kind of the signal from our business there and our reading on the TV [ph] say it might be less than 10, but nevertheless we probably expect a slight reduction reimbursement in Japan.", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Okay. Thank you.", "Bret Wise", "Okay. Thank You", "Operator", "Thank you. We have no further questions, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bret Wise.", "Bret Wise", "Okay, Missy, thank you. As mentioned, I think it\u2019s important that we do some signs of recovery in certain markets. As we\u2019re entering 2010 we have renewed confidence that we'll be able to return to earnings growth this year. We thank you for your continued interest in DENTSPLY and we look for very much to updating you on our progress as we go through the year.

Today's call is being recorded.  At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO.  Please go ahead, sir.", "Bret Wise", "Thank you, Christian.  Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter call.  This is Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO, and also with us today are Chris Clark, our President and COO, and Bill Jellison, our Senior Vice President and CFO.  Each of us will have some prepared remarks this morning and then following our prepared remarks we'll be glad to answer any questions you may have.  ", "Before we get started it's important to note that this call will include some forward looking statements and those are subject to risks and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, as well as our quarterly reports, press releases, and other filings.", "The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forward looking statements, to reflect events or circumstance that may arise after the date of this call.  And as usual, a recording of this conference call in its entirety will be available on our website.  ", "This morning we announced our results for the first quarter 2010 and we're pleased to report a continued acceleration in growth, following what we believe was a bottoming of the dental markets mid last year.  As we expected and commented on in our year-end call, we expect 2010 to start slow, probably with a gradual recovery that varies widely by geographic region.  This frankly in fact is what we have seen, and although there are promising signs in certain geographies for product categories, it is apparent that we are still in the early stages of recovery of many of the dental markets.", "It's important to keep in mind that the dental market is usually a bit of a trailing indicator both going into and also coming out of recessions as our market tends to lag the overall economy just a bit.", "For the first quarter of 2010 our overall growth was 7.7% aided by internal growth and also benefiting from a weaker dollar on a year over year basis.  Sales without precious metal increased 6.8% and that was driven by internal growth of 2.5%, acquisition growth of 0.2%, and giving a constant currency growth of 2.7% and was also aided by currency which added 4.1% in the first quarter.", "The internal growth by geography was 0.9% growth in the US, 2.4% growth in Europe, and 6.0% growth in the rest of the world category.  On a product category basis we continue to see some acceleration in the chairside consumables which grew mid single digits.  The specialty products as a category continued low single digit growth and that is consistent really with what we saw throughout 2009, and the lab category contracted low single digits.", "The continued improvement in the chairside consumables I think is encouraging as we would expect those products that are used every day in the operatory really to be the first to recover and begin to grow.  This is an area of course where we had a favorable comparison last year, particularly outside the US with some dealer destocking in the base, however, despite that we view the growth this quarter as encouraging and reflective of early signs of more normal growth returning to this market, although slowly.", "In the specialties I would say there's not a robust recovery at this point, however, as we stated before these are in some ways the most discretionary and most expensive procedures.  It's also important to realize that we had internal growth in this category in each quarter last year so for us we're not going up against an easy base period at this point.  Despite that, it's comforting to see that these products are continuing to grow, albeit slowly at this point.  ", "And although the prosthetics remain negative in the quarter, the degree of such was much less than we had seen in prior quarters, so perhaps this is an area that is also turning the corner or getting close to turning the corner at this point.  ", "Overall I would say that there's some reasonably good signs on many fronts in the dental market both on a geographic basis and a product category basis.  From an earnings perspective we saw gross margins improve sequentially by 200 basis points compared to the fourth quarter 2009.  You might recall from our year-end call that we had expected to see some sequential improvement in our margins and although we also commented that there would likely be some year over year declines remaining in the first quarter, and that was due to both a tough comparison coming out of the first quarter last year, some adverse currency impacts that will be affecting us this year, also lower plant absorption as we had much tighter controlled inventories in the first quarter of 2010 versus what happened in 2009.,", "And that's essentially what happened.  We had a year over year decline in our margins of 40 basis points, but a sequential improvement in our gross margins over Q4 2009 of 200 basis points.  I think it's also important to note that at 56.7% gross margins in Q1 of 2010 we are starting out a full 90 basis points above the full year 2009 gross margins.", "So overall on a GAAP basis earnings were essentially flat with the prior year in the first quarter of 2010 and on a non-GAAP basis at $0.44 a share, increased 2.3% over the first quarter of 2009.  In total I'd say we're starting out the year about as we had anticipated on a pure operating basis, although our currency assumptions were for a much stronger euro exchange rate at this point.", "Also during the quarter we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares under our prior authorization, and as you probably saw, we announced earlier that our board of directors increased our authorization by 5 million shares in late March.  We did complete two small acquisitions in the quarter, both in Europe, and we signed LOIs on two other small transactions which we would expect to close in Q2 or Q3.  In addition, we continue to be active in discussion with other companies for collaborations or acquisitions and are hopeful that we can see some continued acceleration in this activity as we move forward.", "Looking forward we are pleased to be off to a good start and still expect a gradual recovery throughout 2010.  We remain comfortable with our earlier guidance of low single digit internal growth for the full year.  From a total growth standpoint we have seen the euro continue to weaken and at current rates it would be as light negative in Q2 and would be much more of a headwind in Q3 and Q4 if those rates don't recover somewhat.  ", "We are confirming our earnings guidance at $1.90 to $2 per share for all of 2010, however this can also be influenced by the strength of the dollar.  For the full year, our guidance continues to be based on a euro of $1.39, and although there are still many variables to manage, a stronger dollar would tend to push us towards the lower end of that guidance and a weaker dollar would tend to push us towards the higher end of that guidance.", "That concludes my prepared remarks.  I'd like to turn the call over now to Chris Clark who's going to give you an update on our new products and our innovation efforts.", "Chris Clark", "Thank you, Bret, and good morning, everyone.  I'd like to take a few moments and give you some additional insights into some of our key innovation efforts as well as our recent global implant symposium that was held in Barcelona last night.  ", "Innovation continues to be a key growth platform for us.  Since the beginning of the year we've introduced nine new products.  Highlighting just a few of these this morning, in the prosthetics area we introduced the new Ceramco IC integrated ceramic system.  This is a fully integrated universal porcelain system that offers a complete range of aesthetic shapes and also improves strength.  This allows dental laboratories to replace the optical characteristics of natural dentition or natural teeth while reducing processing steps and minimizing their inventory investment.  Further, the Ceramco IC system can be fabricated across a wide range of platforms, helping our lab customers to stay competitive on all ceramic, porcelain fused metal, and also pressed on metal restorations.", "In the endodontics area we introduced the new X-Smart Easy cordless endodontic handpiece for the US market.  This lightweight simple to use endodontic motor features a comfortable and well balanced cordless handpiece that has a slim head that can be adjusted to allow for an improved field of vision and also better access which are both critical features for dentists that are performing root canal procedures.", "We also continued to gain momentum on new products that you introduced last year.  On previous calls I think I've mentioned our August 2009 introduction of the SureFil SDR posterior bulk built flowable composite.  This product allows for excellent cavity adaptation and also bolt placements up to 4 mm in depth, and results in up to 30% less placement time for the dentist.  Importantly, this unique chemistry employs a new stress-decreasing resin system that addresses one of the primary causes of procedural failure for composites, namely stress accumulation during (inaudible).  ", "In the US we've achieved more than $2.5 million in retail sales in the first eight months since we've introduced the product and we've achieved over $2 million in wholesale sales in Europe since we introduced the product there in January.  Globally, over 21,000 dentists have tried the product and over 11,000 of those are new customers to DENTSPLY in the category of dental composites.  Customer feedback has been just exceptionally positive and we're enjoying various positive reviews from the various product rating agencies as well.", "Looking forward in the orthodontics area we've announced the upcoming introduction of our MTM or minor tooth movement clear aligner which is a minor tooth movement system that uses software and digital scanning technology to deliver a series of clear custom fit liners that progressively move teeth into the prescribed treatment plan position.  The system utilizes our internal aligner service center with dentists and orthodontists sending us an impression or a patient model from which we would then fabricate multiple aligners for that specific patient.  We will be showing the MTM clear aligner product at the upcoming American Association of Orthodontists Meeting that's this weekend in Washington, DC, and we'll begin shipments after we receive final regulatory clearance.", "Finally I'd like to touch briefly on our global implant symposium that we held last month in Barcelona, Spain.  We were extremely pleased with this event.  As we had over 2,500 attendees from over 67 countries, the symposium included a comprehensive scientific program that was led by almost 100 international lecturers and discussed a wide range of implant topics.  It also provided us a very strong platform to showcase our range of implant products including the ankylose implant system which we continue to believe is one of the fastest growing implant lines globally.  ", "I'd like to now turn the call over to Bill Jellison, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss the first quarter financial results in greater detail.", "Bill Jellison", "Thanks, Chris.  Good morning, everyone.  Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 increased by 7.7% in total and increased by 6.8% excluding precious metals.  The sales increase ex precious metals for the quarter included a constant currency increase of 2.7% which includes a 2.5% increase from internal growth and a 0.2% increase from acquisitions.  The quarter was also positively impacted 4.1% from foreign exchange translation as the dollar strengthened against most currencies -- weakened against most currencies from last year's first quarter.", "The geographic mix of sales ex precious metals in the first quarter of 2010 included the US at 37.4%, Europe represented 42.7%, and the rest of world was 19.9% of sales.  Gross profit margins as a percent of sales ex precious metal content in the first quarter of 2010 were 56.7% compared to 57.1% for the first quarter of 2009.  The rate was negatively impacted in the quarter compared to the same period last year due to negative product mix within the product line, foreign exchange transactional impacts, and also lower plant cost absorption compared to the prior period when we had significant inventory build which was offset somewhat by price increases.  These negative impacts were partially offset by the higher roll off of acquisition inventory step-up costs in 2009.  Although margins were lower than in the first quarter last year, they improved two full percentage points sequentially as price mix, FX, and manufacturing cost all improved.", "SG&A expenses were $188 million or 37.8% of sales ex previous metals in the first quarter of 2010 versus 38.2% in the prior year's first quarter, a 40 basis point improvement.  These expenses were lower as a percent of sales primarily due to reductions that were made during 2009, partially offset by additional investments made to strengthen our future growth prospects, as well as from the normal resetting of some of our variable costs such as commissions, rebates, and bonuses.  Of the $10 million increase in SG&A, $8 million is from the impact of FX movement and acquisitions.  ", "Operational margins for the quarter were 16.4% compared to 17% in the first quarter of last year, operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals were 18% compared to 18.5% last year in the same period.  Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals for comparative purposes, excluding recent acquisition activities and restructuring and other costs in both periods, would have been 19% in the first quarter of 2010 and 19.4% in the first quarter of 2009.", "Net interest and other expense in the first quarter was $5.9 compared to net interest and other expense of $5.1 million last year in the first quarter.  The increase in this area resulted primarily from higher net interest expense which reflects lower returns on our cash balances.  ", "The corporate tax rate in the quarter of approximately 26% is relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2009.  We expect this to be a reasonable assumption for an operational tax rate for 2010. ", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International for the first quarter of 2010 was $61.8 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared to $0.41 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009.  Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the first quarter on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring and other costs, recent acquisition related activities, and income tax related adjustments, was $65.5 million or $0.44 per diluted share in 2010 compared to $64.1 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009 which is a 2.3% improvement in EPS.", "Cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter of 2010 was approximately $37 million compared to $11 million in the same period last year.  The cash flow in the first quarter of 2010 was higher last year due primarily to an increase in accrued liabilities and accounts payable associated with various variable cost categories and less inventory build in the first quarter of this year compared to last year.", "Capital expenditures were $8 million in the first quarter with depreciation and amortization at $17.8 million in the period.  Inventory days were 103 at the end of the first quarter of 2010 compared to 115 at the end of the first quarter last year and 99 days at the end of 2009.  Receivable days were 59 days at the end of the first quarter in 2010 compared to 58 days at the end of the first quarter in 2009 and 55 days at the end of 2009.  We believe our accounts receivables remain in good shape and continue to be a focus of our team.", "At the end of the first quarter of 2010 we had $405 million in cash and short term investment.  Total debt was $477 million at the end of the first quarter.  During the first quarter we have also repurchased $41 million or 1.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $33.59 per share.  Based on the company's recent increase in its authorization which allows us to maintain up to 22 million shares of Treasury stock, we still have approximately 5.5 million shares available for repurchase and would expect some continued repurchase activity this year.", "Finally, as Bret noted, we are reconfirming our full year guidance for diluted earnings per share of $1.90 to $2, excluding the impact of restructuring and other cost, acquisition-related activities, and one-time adjustments.  ", "The mid range of this guidance is based on an average dollar rate compared to the euro of approximately $1.36 to $1.40 which is a stronger euro than exists today.", "That concludes our prepared remarks.  Thanks for your support and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator's Instructions) We'll go first to John Kreger with William Blair.", "John Kreger - William Blair", "", "Hi.  Thanks very much.  Bill, just a quick followup on that last remark you made.  If you look at the euro exchange rates where they are now, what would you estimate would be the earnings that you sort of absorbed if those exchange rates persist for the rest of the year?", "Bill Jellison", "I think one of the things that we've stated in the past, John, is that movements on currency obviously have a significant impact in general across the company depending on where they move and the best way to really answer that question is really to talk about it on an aggregate move against the world currencies.  And as you know, different currencies move in different directions, but I think a broader based movement on currencies in the neighborhood of about a 5% level typically has about a top line impact on it of about 3% since 60% of our sales are overseas, and I think that in general again if you have movements consistently with currencies in those same ranges at 5%, that typically has about a 1%-2% impact on our bottom line on average.  ", "So hopefully that kind of gives you an idea.  If rates right now are roughly closer to 131 level in comparison to an upper mid kind of 30 level, I think that you're probably looking at maybe a 2, 2.5, maybe 3% on average if all currencies were all moving in that same magnitude that probably equates to maybe a penny a share per half a year.", "John Kreger - William Blair", "Excellent, thank you.  And just my followup question gets to your comment about seeing an improvement start to play out across different geographies.  If you look at that and look at geographies where the markets are typically self pay versus markets where they are more government pay, are you seeing a difference in the trajectory of the recovery so far?", "Bret Wise", "John, this is Bret.  Over 120 countries, it is kind of hard to draw that generalization. So for instance, countries like Italy which are all self pay, I think we are starting to see a very slow recovery there as well.  Countries where it is all pay by government or largely reimbursed by government, that would include for instance the UK and Germany, we're also starting to see some recoveries there.  So I don't know that we've been able to differentiate based on reimbursement with that level of definition yet.  I think it is more driven by consumer confidence in those regions and so forth than anything else, and counties where there is no reimbursement is largely driven by employment.", "John Kreger - William Blair", "Okay, makes sense.  And then lastly, do you have a view on the recently passed healthcare reform bill?  Do you think it'll have an impact on your business over time?", "Bret Wise", "Well just a few comments on that.  The healthcare reform bill largely did not include dentistry.  It included some coverage for children up to a multiple of the welfare level, so that'd be children under age 21, and it also of course includes a provision that children up to age 26 now can stay on their parents' coverage.  So those two provisions could in fact result in some expanded procedures for dentistry, and I think because it's mainly children it's mainly preventive type procedures rather than heavy reconstructive type procedures.", "On the other hand because we're a medical device company we're subject to the 2.3% excise tax on medical device sales and that's for Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 medical devices.  And most of our products do fall under those categories.  So at this point we see benefit because of perhaps higher coverage for children or dependents up to age 26, and at least at this point we're subject to that excise tax and it's a question of how that will affect our pricing and so forth going forward.  I think that's not entirely clear year because the bill hasn't been available for that long and there's going to need to be some changes to the bill so we're going to have to closely track what happens to that bill before this gets implemented.", "John Kreger - William Blair", "", "Great, thanks very much.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Tao Levy with Deutsche Bank.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Great, thank you very much.  I had just two quick questions on the new product you're launching in orthodontics.  Is this, just to be clear, just for the front and bottom six, right, top and bottom six?", "Chris Clark", "Yeah, it's focusing on the minor tooth movement, if you will, of the social six, correct.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Got you.  And do you have a sense of how many aligners that's going to require?", "Chris Clark", "Yeah, it is a multiple aligner product, Tao, so that could range anywhere from three trays to 10 trays depending on really the specific patient case.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Right.  And then given that the orthodontic conference is coming up and you made some reference to that market in your prepared remark, what is your sense of how orthodontics and the market uptake evolves throughout the rest of the year, and anything interesting we could hear out of that conference this weekend?  Thank you.", "Chris Clark", "Yeah.  I think obviously for us the MTM will be the major thing you will hear from.  I think the orthodontic case starts there is no doubt are down based on all the data we have seen.  I mean it is an elective generally non-reimbursed procedure that certainly can be deferrable.  I mean, if your children need braces and you can straighten their teeth at age 14, you can also straighten them at age 17, so it is deferrable, and I think the market clearly has seen that.", "Now in terms of the general orthodontic market, my sense is it will gradually come back as Bret mentioned.  It will be a gradual recovery.  In terms of the specific AO show my guess is you will see, obviously we hope some excitement on the MTM product.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Thank you.  Good morning, guys.  Bret, I wanted to start on a couple maybe bigger picture organic growth questions.  One, I didn't hear you specifically reference implant or ortho organic growth in the quarter.  Just could you give us some directionality there?  And then also you and I have had some conversations over the last few months about Europe kind of lagging into the downfall in dental or the falloff in dental and probably lagging out.  Now, a good bounceback this quarter in the European organic growth to plus 2.5%.  So just wondering if anything's changed there, if you're surprised at especially the European bounceback, any comments there would be helpful.", "Bret Wise", "Okay.  Sure, Jeff.  Implant, ortho, and actually endo, all three of our specialties, had low single digit internal growth during the quarter.  Specifically with orthodontics our business was much stronger in Europe than it was in the United States.  With respect to implants it was the opposite.  Our business was strongest in the United States and weaker outside the United States.  On implant I think I would add that even though we had low single digit growth overall for the world, there were two regions or two countries that -- or two regions frankly, that depressed that number for us, which was CIS and South Korea.  And absent CIS and South Korea we would've been mid-single digit internal growth in implant.  So we're still seeing good uptake in that product line.  As Chris mentioned we had our large symposium in Barcelona in March and we had very strong attendance at that so that was encouraging.  And overall I think we see the implant market and the orthodontics market both probably experiencing kind of low single digit growth coming out of the recession here.  And again, those grew throughout 2009.", "Europe was a little bit stronger than we thought it would be in the first quarter, frankly.  You are probably recalling what we said on the conference call at the end of the year.  We saw very strong growth in the consumable categories in Europe and I think that is encouraging to us because it is evidence that every dentistry is starting to pick up there, although with Europe in particular it is important that we say it varies widely by country because we have some countries where their economies are under significant distress right now and others that seem to be participating in the global recovery.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Thanks, that's helpful.  And then on the crown and bridge side, the low single digit decline there on the prosthetics, a much better number this quarter.  And some of the patient data we track on a weekly basis seems like we're seeing a bigger pick up in crown and bridge than we are in a lot of other categories which is surprising us.  Do you think it is end user demand in the US that may be picking up for crown and bridge, those things only being deferrable for so long, or do you think there is any restocking going on here?  I know there was a bit destocking impact on your artificial teeth and some of your other prosthetic stuff last year.", "Chris Clark", "Yeah, Jeff, it's Chris.  I think relative to particularly the US market, my sense is it's rebounding a little bit.  I think Bret's comments that we're optimistic that we may be either near the bottom or we can see the bottom from here, obviously it did decline overall a bit and I do think that you mentioned it, I think we did have a bit of an easier comp on that business because of the destocking in the prior year base.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay, thanks.  And last couple of questions probably just modeling questions I guess more than anything for Bill.  Acquisition impact the rest of the year with the LOIs that are out there and that, will that still be kind of in the low single digit range or how should we think about modeling that?  And then interest expense, I'm still just not quite clear why it went up sequentially a couple million dollars relative to the last few quarters with interest rates here at the last few quarters having been relatively stable.", "Bill Jellison", "", "Sure.  I think you got a couple different points on the interest side -- well, first maybe on the acquisition piece.  For acquisitions, Jeff, you should -- we only talked really about the acquisitions that we kind of complete whether we have got an LOI out there or not so I think you are a couple tenths of a point at least at this point is probably what you should be using in your models until those acquisitions are ultimately completed and any other future ones are done.  As it relates to the interest expense category, Jeff, there's a couple points associated with that.  One is the weakening of the euro since that's where all of our cash is.  Obviously the interest income is getting translated at a lower level.  You've also got the fact that the $250 million private placement that we completed, that was about 100 million higher than the one that fell off and keep in mind that that one's a fixed rate one which was replacing that neither variable debt and/or cash.  So that's probably on average three quarters of a million to maybe a million dollars a quarter in that number, plus we also had some of the repurchasing activity within that quarter as well.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "All right, so barring any significant euro moves at this point, the 5.8 million somewhere in that ballpark is a good go-forward number to think about for the rest of the year?", "Bill Jellison", "Yeah.  I think that that's reasonable excluding any additional acquisition or stock repurchase items that are driving that.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay.  And the two deals that have an LOI out there I know haven't closed so we won't put them in the model, but would they be of any size to note or relatively minor?", "Bret Wise", "Jeff, this is Bret.  Those are small kind of tuck under deals.  I don't think you need to model those at this point.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "All right.  Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Adam Picard (ph) with Barclays Capital.", "Adam Picard - Barclays Capital", "Thanks, good morning.  Could you guys just elaborate I guess on the two small acquisitions that you did complete in Europe, I guess kind of what that added to your capabilities?", "Bret Wise", "Yeah.  Te two small acquisitions, one was an endodontics equipment company and so that is kind of a vertical integration.  It is a company we did some business with before and we brought that capability in house.  The second is an orthodontic sales and marketing organization in one of the European countries which we've had a close relationship for some time, but wanted to acquire to go direct in that country.", "Adam Picard - Barclays Capital", "Okay great, thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Derek Leckow with Barrington Research.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Thank you, good morning.  Just a couple followups here on the geographic growth and the expectations for Europe.  I wanted to kind of quantify your exposure to some of the weaker economies there, especially Spain, Portugal, Greece.", "Bret Wise", "You're looking for like a percent of sales?", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Yeah.  I mean is it something meaningful that we should be concerned about or I'm just --", "Bret Wise", "No.  I mean obviously probably Spain is the largest of the three.  I would say Portugal is a very small component of our European sales.  And remember, 40% of our sales are in Europe and half that is Germany.  The other big countries would be the UK, France, Italy, to a lesser extent the Benelux region.  So the countries that you're mentioning that seem to be under the most pressure, the governments seem to be under the most pressure, for the most part are not significant countries to our geographic mix in Europe.  Spain would be the largest of the three you mentioned.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "All right.  And then within that 40% coming from Germany, how's the lab business doing in Germany and are you getting pretty good visibility on dental visits and so forth?  I mean, what is your sense for how that economy is doing and those two separate areas, lab versus the general dental?", "Chris Clark", "Yeah.  I would say that generally it's probably a bit slower than what we've seen in the US.  I think there might be a little bit of a rebound in terms of procedures in the US.  I don't know that we've seen anything that significant per say over at least a three month period in Germany that would be noticeably different from where we've been.", "Bret Wise", "Yeah.  And what I'd add to that Derek is that this general trend we're seeing where the chairside consumables are rebounding the fastest seems to be applying equally the same in Europe as we see in the United States.  So in the countries you are talking about we've seen the stuff that's used in the (inaudible) everyday coming back the quickest.", "Derek Leckow \u2013 Barrington Research", "Okay, good.  And then the rust world, growth that you saw there, the main drivers -- I think I missed what you said, but is that Latin America?  Is that where you saw -- is Brazil doing really well or what is the --", "Bret Wise", "No, we didn't mention what countries, but off the top of my head the countries that are leading that; Australia continued to be very strong, Canada was strong, and some of the Latin American countries were strong.  So if I had to summarize those three I would mention --", "Chris Clark", "Middle East as well.", "Bret Wise", "Oh that was a pretty deflated base.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "India and China kind of flattish?  Is that relatively flat?", "Bret Wise", "India has not grown as fast as we would have expected at this point, I would say generally, and that may be a temporary situation I am not sure.  It is also influenced by the South Korea.  I mentioned that in the implants where the economy is quite bad and I think there are some structural things in that market that are slowing things down.", "Chris Clark", "I think it is also fair to say, Derek, that in space from a comparison perspective, that we also had some easier comps in that category in comparison to last year.  So that number is probably a little bit high in relationship to where we really see it.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Okay, good.  And then just moving onto operating margin, a little bit lighter than we expected and I think you talked about the impact of currency, but beyond currency what is driving the increase in spending levels?  I think you said there were some one time true ups on some bonuses and commissions and stuff like that, but does that roll off in the second quarter?  Can you remind me how these increases will play out for the rest of the year?", "Bret Wise", "No.  I think if you are talking about some of the more variable expense categories and the impacts, no, I think that it is fair to say, Derek, as you look through really all of last year and from a performance perspective, the impacts of the year were fully reflected, in I think each one of those quarters, and in fact in some of the periods were more impacted especially in the middle part.  So I think that of those categories you should expect are going to continue to run at a little bit higher level in comparison to what they did last year just because of the performance levels that were expected to be achieved.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "So it is fair to say we are going to be kind of below the long-term goal of having 30 to 50 basis points of improvement in operating margin this year, or would you say they would kind of rebound later in the year?", "Bret Wise", "Well, I think first off generally we say that on the operating margin side of the equation the guidance and the broader-based assumptions that we give in that category are really more on a multi-year basis.  We try not to give specific guidance to that type of number in any of the quarters.  However, I would expect, as you saw in the first quarter, improvements at least sequentially on the gross profit margin side while we were also lower on the SG&A and in the first Q, I think that as you saw throughout last year, the SG&A rates were coming down, so some of those comparisons, especially as you get into let's say the fourth quarter, would be much more difficult on a comparison in that period, although hopefully the reverse of that with the gross margin side, gross margins in the second half of the year should hopefully look better in comparison to the last year's periods.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Okay, so I think what you're saying is we should kind of be modeling roughly a flattish operating margin for the year?", "Chris Clark", "Derek, it's too early -- we're not giving (inaudible) operating margins for the year.  I think our earnings guidance is probably what you ought to look at.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Yeah, I backed into it from the guidance and I can't seem to get to a number that's flat so that's why I'm asking.  All right, and then finally let me ask a question on the clear liners.  You said they are going to be using some of your existing lab capacity and I just wondered if you could elaborate on how much you are going to have to spend in terms of capital spending to grow that business or what kind of expectations do you have initially for the launch and for the spending around that?", "Chris Clark", "Yeah, it's Chris.  Again, the lab we have has a fair amount of capacity.  We've obviously geared up and anticipated this and made some investments really over the previous 12-18 months to get ready for it so I think we're in pretty good shape today and obviously if it exceeds our expectations which is always something to hope for that is a relatively easy investment for us to make further.  I don't think it's a material investment in terms of incremental at this stage of the game.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "And then just strategically, does this perhaps cannibalize any of your existing orthodontic products or does it compete in any way with anything that you currently sell in certain terms of your clear self ligating brackets and so forth?", "Bret Wise", "I think it is really largely a different segment.  We do offer a chairside MTM basis product that has done relatively well for us, but this now expands that into a lab-based service and again I think that most of us this would be incremental to us as opposed to cannibalizing our bracket sale.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "But at least as it relates to that chairside MTM product, that should be something we would expect most practitioners will be probably just opt to use your lab, is that fair to say?", "Bret Wise", "My guess is, Derek, it is probably going to be largely incremental.  The folks that are doing it chairside probably doing it because they like to do it themselves and again we will still offer that, but if they don't want to do it themselves, we didn't have an offering previously and now we do and obviously some other folks do and that is now a segment that we think is pretty attractive and we are excited about our entry into it.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "All right, very good.  Thanks a lot and good luck.", "Bret Wise", "Thanks, Derek.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Brian Delaney of EnTrust.", "Brian Delaney - EnTrust", "Hi, guys.  On the clear liner product as well, have you guys thought about price points?  Where should we think the price point is for this?  And second question is you said it is for minor tooth movement, is that the ultimate goal or do we want to see how it works first and then is there opportunity to get into a bigger type of offering?", "Bret Wise", "Yeah, let me answer the second one first.  We believe it is a minor tooth movement product.  I think that is what the technology at this point delivers and what we are comfortable with.  Again, I think there is a demonstrable need for that product and I think we're very comfortable with how that's positioned.  I wouldn't necessarily say hey you can't migrate over time, but that's certainly not the going in strategy.  I think to a degree it is what it is and we're excited about it.", "The second piece in terms of pricing, I hesitate to give specific pricing as we're not in the market yet, but what I guess I would leave you with is it's going to be pretty competitively priced, so from that angle we think we offer a good value equation to the customer and obviously we're excited about the margins on our end as well.", "Brian Delaney - EnTrust", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Scott Green from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Hi, thanks for the question.  Question on a new product in endo, your new skinny nickel titanium rotary path files are first to market and I was wondering if you could talk about initial consumer adoption trends and whether you think it could drive market share gains that spill over into the larger nickel titanium product line that makes up a bigger piece of the endo pie.  I'm not sure why dentists would need multiple vendors there.", "Bret Wise", "Scott, let me take a stab at that.  The path file is kind of a unique file that a dentist or an endodontist can use at the beginning of the procedure to kind of find their way to the apex of the tooth and it's an important tool for them to use.  Obviously we try to do dual branding and packaging solutions and so forth with our that file to grab more market share.  I would say that probably the path file doesn't provide a unique link to our other branded products though.  The path file could be used with a competitor's file as well.  So we came out with that file just because we saw that there was a need for a clinical solution to that issue and we're happy with the success of that file and of course we're going to use it to our advantage to the extent we can.  But I would say that there is not a technical link between that and the other files at this point.", "Chris Clark", "Yeah, I'd view it as an adjunct to our existing lines.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay.  And then you talked about last year distributor inventory destocking and a little update here, I was wondering where we stand in terms of inventory days out there in the channel before the recession versus today and whether you expect or have seen any restocking or maybe this new level is the new normal going forward?", "Chris Clark", "Yeah.  I guess I would say that in the quarter we really didn't see any significant net change either way.  Obviously in the prior year base we did see some destocking and we found it in I think in a few cases in terms of where that might have given us a bit of favorable comparisons.  In terms of is this the new norm, my gut reaction is that demand will need to come back reasonably in a healthy manner for customers to look at it and say they need more inventory to service.  I think that in all likelihood they are doing an effective job servicing with the inventories they have being at this new level.  Might there be some pockets in terms of restocking, yeah there may be, but I don't know that I'd see a wholesale change if you will, in terms of the inventory levels as the economy recovers per say.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay.  And then one question on the implant line, I believe you expanded the North American implant sales force here at the beginning of the year, was that driven by better visibility into market trends or more confidence into your new ankylose model or other factors?  ", "Bret Wise", "Well, we made a couple of investments in sales and marketing kind of as more last year than this year.  Specifically with respect to the North American market that is a market we have been investing in for a couple of years here both in sales, resources, and in marketing resources.  We do believe that that ankylose product line is a strong compliment to our (inaudible ) product line.  We have got two strong brands here in the United States and they have been growing above market here for two or three years in a row and I think that continued in the first quarter.  That's where we had double digit growth and implants in the US.  ", "So obviously we're trying to back the brands we think where they're strongest around the world, but that is an area where we've had kind of consistent investment for some time now.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay great, thank you.", "Operator", "This does conclude our question and answer session.  I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Bret Wise", "Okay.  Thank you, Kristen, and thank you all for attending this morning.  I say that we're encouraged by the early signs of growth in our markets and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year.

(NASDAQ:XRAY) Q2 2010 Earnings Conference Call  July 29, 2010  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Bret Wise - CEO", "Bill Jellison - CFO", "Chris Clark - COO", "", "Analysts", "", "Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Ravi Fadah - William Blair", "Elliot Feldman - Barclays Capital", "Scott Green - Bank of America", "", "Operator", "Please standby we are about to begin. Good day and welcome to today\u2019s DENTSPLY 2010 second quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to, Mr. Bret Wise. Please go ahead sir.", "Bret Wise", "", "Okay thank you Ben and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. This is Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and also with us today are Chris Clark our President, Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Jellison our Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019d like to begin today\u2019s call with some overview comments on our results for the quarter, and also our view of the state of the global dental market. And I\u2019ll then have Bill Jellison provide more details on the financial results. And following our comments, of course we\u2019ll be all glad to answer any questions you may have. ", "Before we get started it\u2019s important to note that this conference call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. And these should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties described in the company\u2019s most recent annual report on Form 10K, and our periodic reports on Form 10Q, our press releases and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. And as usual a recording of this conference call in its entirety will be available on our website. ", "This morning we announced our results for the second quarter of 2010 and are pleased to report a continuation of the sequential improvement that we saw emerging, beginning in the third quarter last year, continuing with positive internal growth in the fourth quarter 2009, and now a slight acceleration of growth as we move through the first half of 2010. Overall our sales improved 2.2% in the quarter, and without precious metal content improved 1.5%. This growth was driven by 2.5% internal growth, consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, and acquisition growth of 0.3% giving us a constant currency growth of 2.8%. This allowed us to overcome a negative comparison from currency of a minus 1.3% and that was driven largely by the rapid devaluation of the euro against the dollar during the quarter. ", "The 2.5% internal growth reflects potentially flat growth in the US, down 0.1%, 4.4% growth in Europe and 3.7% growth for the rest of world. US growth reflects a continuation of the low single digit growth we\u2019ve experienced in the specialties in the aggregate, and that\u2019s really consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, offset by slightly weaker sales in the lab products which we were down low single digits in the quarter. Our overall assessment of the US market really has not shown any meaningful improvement over what we saw in the first quarter. However, that should not be a surprise as we look the economic data and the fact that we are really experiencing a jobless recovery in the US. And of course we will know more about the overall market when the distributors report in the next few weeks. ", "European growth remains strong at 4.4% in part by easier comparisons from the prior year, particularly in the CIS region, but also strong growth this quarter in our consumables, and in essentially all of our specialty categories. The remainder of the world had internal growth of 3.7% and that was driven mostly by strong performance in Asia, Latin America and Canada. A worldwide performance by product category was low single digit growth in consumables, lab was negative low single digits and the specialty category was positive mid-single digits. ", "There is always much interest in our dental implant business which had internal growth in the 3% to 4% range, led by double-digit growth in the US and low single digit growth in Europe. We believe we continue to take share in global implant market driven by two very strong implant product platforms, and also the investments we have made in sales, marketing and R&D over the past several years. ", "Our earnings on a non-GAAP basis came in at $0.50 per share; it\u2019s a 2% improvement on stronger operating margins of 20.3% again on a non-GAAP basis which was a 20 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. These are the strongest operating margins we have delivered since 2008 prior to the recession. Our earnings would have been much stronger on a currency neutral basis, however the rapid decline in the euro in particular, and strength of the yen combined to hurt earnings by a couple pennies a share in the second quarter. ", "In addition, we continue to have very strong cash from the quarter, with operating cash flows year-to-date of $150 million, that\u2019s up 30% from the prior year. Year-to-day we have completed four small acquisitions, two of which were in July and today we repurchased 5.4 million shares under our share authorization which was expanded in March. Our balance sheet remains in really in very good shape, we are producing very strong cash flows and improving results and we feel good about our prospects. ", "We continue to make internal investments in growth, and have been particularly pleased with the performance of some of our new products which was launched over the last year. We feel we continue to gain momentum in the specialty product categories and have had some real positive signs from select new product launches in the consumable category. This tells us that dentists still welcome the opportunity to invest in their practices through new dental technologies, which we view as a good sign for the future. ", "As noted in the release, our exposure to the euro will likely continue to have a negative impact on our results compared to what we expected when we entered the year. With the euro now below $1.30, which compares unfavorably to what was $1.43 in the third quarter last year, and $1.47 in the fourth quarter last year, our currency will likely continue to be a headwind for us over the next two quarters. Given this currency impact we are adjusting our earning\u2019s guidance to a range of $1.86 to $1.94 on a fully diluted basis for all of 2010, and again that\u2019s measured on a non GAAP basis. ", "I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Bill Jellison who will discuss the financial results in more detail. Bill.", "Bill Jellison", "Thanks Bret morning everyone. Net sales for the second quarter of 2010 increased by 2.2% in total an increase by 1.5% excluding precious metals. The sales increased ex-precious metals for the quarter, included a constant currency increase of 2.8% which included at 2.5% increase from internal growth and 0.3% increase from acquisitions. The quarter was also negatively impacted 1.3% from foreign exchange translation, largely due to the dollar strengthening against the euro compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. The geographic mix of sales ex-precious metals in the second quarter of 2010 included the US at 38%, Europe represented 39% and the rest of the world was 23% of sales. We do not believe the channel inventory changes has any significant impact on the company-wide internal growth rates in the period, however we do believe the European growth was benefited by a rebound in the CIS markets this quarter. The stronger dollar in the second quarter, especially against the euro in the same period last year had a negative impact on earnings per share in the period of nearly $0.02 per share. Although the euro has shown some recent strength based on the current currency rates we believe we will continue to have a negative impact on both, sales and earnings in the back half of the year.", "Gross profit margins as a percentage of sales ex-precious metal content in the second quarter of 2010 were 55.4% compared to 55.8% for the second quarter of 2009. When compared to the same period last year, we were negatively impacted by product mix, which was partially offset by improved pricing. We did benefit from some positive manufacturing and purchase price variances, however many of those were not fully reflected in the second quarter, but they will have some benefit on the margin rates in the back half of the year. ", "SG&A expenses were $182.4 million or 35.1% of sales ex-precious metals in the second quarter of 2010, versus 35.9% in the prior years second quarter. These expenses were not only lower than those in the last years second quarter on a dollar basis, but they were also lower when measured as a percent of sales. We are currently benefiting from some of the expense reductions we put in place last year. Importantly, some of the benefits of our expense focus continue to be reinvested in areas we believe can help support future growth opportunities. ", "Operational margins for the quarter were 18.6% compared to 17.9% in the second quarter of last year. Our operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals were 20.2% compared to 19.3% last year in the same period. And operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals for comparative purposes, excluding acquisition related activities, and restructuring and other costs in both periods would have been 20.3% in the second quarter of 2010 and 20.1% in 2009. ", "As we move into the back half of the year, we expect favorable improvements in our gross profit margin rates compared to last year, as we achieved better absorption of costs, reflect improved pricing and benefit from a slightly more favorable mix. However, we also believe SG&A expenses will run higher in the back half of the year as a percentage of sales as many of our cost improvements were already in place in the back half of last year, and we have continued to invest in key growth opportunities. ", "Net interest and other expense in the second quarter was $6.6 million compared to $3.7 million last year in the second quarter. The increased expense in this area of $2.9 million was primarily the result of a non-cash interest charge of $1.2 million, resulting from a credit risk adjustment on the outstanding derivatives which we highlighted as an adjustment for our non GAAP earnings per share, and a foreign exchange transaction loss of $1.4 million versus a slight gain of $0.2 million in the same quarter last year. We were also negatively impacted by lower interest income on our cash balances as rates have decreased, since last year. ", "The corporate tax rate in the second quarter of 2009 and 2010 was approximately 25.5%, and we believe this is also a reasonable rate to assume for the remainder of this year. Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the second quarter of 2010 was $72.4 million or $0.49 per diluted share compared to $70.2 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009. Our net income attributable to DENTSPLY on an adjusted non GAAP basis, excluding acquisition related costs, restructuring and other costs, a credit risk adjustment to outstanding derivatives and income tax related adjustments was $73.9 million or $0.50 per diluted share in 2010 compared to $73.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009. ", "Cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter was $113 million compared to $105 million in the prior year quarter, and in the first half of 2010 it was approximately $150 million compared to $115 million in the same period last year. Capital expenditures were $19 million in the first half of the year, with depreciation and amortization at about $34 million in the first half. Capital expenditures right now are currently expected to be in the range of about $50 million to $60 million for the entire year. ", "Inventory days were 100 at the end of the second quarter of 2010 compared to 103 days at the end of the first quarter, and 110 days at the end of the same period last year. We do expect some additional improvement in inventories by the end of year, but most of that should occur in the forth quarter. Accounts receivable days were 57 days at the end of the second quarter of 2010 compared to 59 days at the end of the first quarter, and 57 days at the end of the second quarter in 2009. We believe our accounts receivable are in good shape and they remain a key focus for our entire team. ", "At the end of the second quarter of 2010 we had $340 million in cash in short-term investments; total debt was $475 million at the end of the second quarter as well. Year-to-date we have repurchased approximately $185 million of our stock or approximately 5.4 million shares at an average price of approximately $34. Based on the company\u2019s authorization [demand] up to 22 million shares of treasury stock, we now have approximately 2 million shares still available for repurchase. ", "Finally, due to the strengthening of the dollar against most currencies, and with the dollar at approximately $130 to the euro, we expect a top line headwind in the back half of the year of approximately 3% to 5%. As we look at our results year-to-date, our current business outlook and recent foreign exchange movements we are adjusting our 2010 full year earnings per diluted share guidance to $1.86 to $1.94 on a non GAAP basis, excluding restructuring and other costs, our recent acquisition related activities and income tax related adjustment. ", "That concludes our prepared remarks and thanks for your support and we\u2019d be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer session", "", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. ", "Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse", "Yes thanks guys, I just had a quick question about organic growth. Bill if I heard you correctly was organic growth 2.5% in the first quarter and it just slightly decelerated to 2% in the second quarter, did I hear that correctly?", "Bret Wise", "No this is Bret it was actually 2.5% in both, the first and second quarter. So it\u2019s internal growth, excluding FX and excluding acquisitions, 2.5% both quarters.", "Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse", "Okay because my question really revolves around gross margins. If I heard correctly you are sort of assuming that gross margins maybe pick up a little bit in the back half of the year, and I was kind of curious as to maybe, and I know you kind of attributed that to better absorption and mix, but is there some expectation of an acceleration of organic growth to drive those higher margins or no?", "Bret Wise", "Yes, our guidance for the year on internal growth is low single digit, that's what we entered the year with. I think given the state of the market we are comfortable with staying with that kind of guidance, although I don't think we are being specific about whether it would accelerate from here or decelerate a little bit, who knows. I think it\u2019s hard to predict in this market. So the gross margin comments coming from Bill this morning are more driven by the fact that we know what we were doing last year in the back half of year, which was rapidly bringing down inventory, and we have programs in place this year we think that will give us some acceleration in gross margins. So we are comfortable that we\u2019ll have year-over-year benefits in the back half.", "Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse", "Okay Bret, so the point is that gross margin should be up year-over-year in the back half, but you are not necessarily saying they should accelerate sequentially.", "Bret Wise", "I think that would be fair.", "Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse", "Okay, and then just a follow up question on SG&A. We obviously picked down about $5 million sequentially in the second quarter and you guys kind touched upon those reasons but I thought I also heard you expected that SG&A to trend higher over the next couple of quarters. Is that also a statement about the sequential sort of trend line for SG&A? Should it head back up to that 185 to 190 level?", "Bill Jellison", "Associated with the SG&A, the SG&A comment that we made was really relative to kind how the SG&A looked relative to last year. If you look at the kind of quarter breakdowns that existed throughout last year, you\u2019d see that SG&A pretty much improved both really in dollars and also as a percent of sales, especially as we moved into the back half of last year. That\u2019s because most of our cost reduction efforts that we put in place really didn\u2019t fully impact us until the back half of 2009, plus as I mentioned we started to reinvest in a couple other key areas for some additional growth and that reinvestment really didn\u2019t occur until late 2009.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Bill I guess I\u2019ll start with you on the FX you said it was about a $0.02 hit or so to Q2, your [trim] end guidance by a nickel or so, how much of that trimmed guidance is purely kind of the FX flow through on the model, versus maybe fundamentally taken a little more cautious look at things over the next few quarters?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes Jeff, as far as FX is concerned based on where the rates were at before and where they are now, virtually the entire reduction to our guidance is associated with the FX changes. ", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "And the 3% to 5% headwind you were talking that\u2019s an H2 headwind not a full year, so the H2 headwind each of the next two quarters should be 3% to 5% at the top line?", "Bill Jellison", "That\u2019s correct, and again that\u2019s on the top line that\u2019s not the total impact of the currency move, but that\u2019s the impact that\u2019s affecting our sales.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Fair enough, and Bret any insight on the acquisitions that were completed in July, size or should I not even be dumping them into my model?", "Bret Wise", "There is a small tuck under our acquisitions. I don\u2019t think you need to adjust your model form at this point. ", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "And then on the US number down 0.1% on the organic. Bret I think if I heard your comments you felt like US was pretty stable, the flipside to that is it did seen to slow sequentially by a point, so just trying to reconcile those two things?", "Bret Wise", "Yes, and I think some of that can be compared to the base line, because you might remember our comments in the first quarter there was some inventory reductions in the base period, more so in the first quarter than in the second quarter. And in the second quarter this year we ended up essentially flat in the US positive in specialties, a little bit of a drag from the lab business and we kind of view that as a stable situation. ", "One other thing that\u2019s probably affecting us is in the second and third quarters last year. We were promoting our equipment in the US pretty heavily, we had some good uptake on that, and I think that\u2019s creating a little bit of a negative comparison in the second quarter this year, and we may have that in the third quarter again. But that\u2019s pretty minor when measures across the whole business. ", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "And just so I understand your base period comments that what you are saying is last year in the first quarter of \u201809 you had more of inventory destocking which helped Q1 of \u201810 and that tailwind in Q2 \u201810 wasn\u2019t quite as great?", "Bret Wise", "Yes, I think by the time we got to the second quarter there wasn\u2019t much inventory liquidation in the US going on last year.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "And last question was on just from a new product standpoint, any comments with the FDA and the MTM product?", "Chris Clark", "Yes Jeff, its Chris. Let me comment first in terms of broader new products, it hit MTM as well. I mean I think overall we are really pretty pleased as Bret mentioned with the update of recent innovations, in particular we highlight the SDR global portfolio comprises which right now we are up to over 30000 new users globally, which is we think certainly pretty nice in terms of the update and the momentum continues. We are also real pleased with several introductions over the last several quarters on the endo side, particularly Vortex file and the path file. And then also certain kind of brain x-ray on the prosthetic side, we are pleased with continue to see pretty solid uptake in terms of that element of the lab business. ", "We had a couple of introductions in Q2 as well, we expanded our comparative centralized manufacturing of precious metals to the US, we introduced a SMARTLIGHT Max LED curing light that has a lot more versatility if you will to that area, particularly because this is basically procure a wider range of restorative materials. As we look forward we had a pretty solid pipeline moving forward. Specific to the MTM, I mean we did have a discussion on new the product with dentists and had filed F10-K on the product, and at this point are waiting for approval with FDA. We were hopeful that we would have approval from FDA during this quarter, but obviously that\u2019s kind of tough to predict and we are in dialogue with FDA, we are hopeful that we get approval on that later this year. Obviously once we have approval then we\u2019ll do the full launch moving forward. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Derek Leckow with Barrington Research.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "On the comments on organic growth 2.5% you did break that down partially, you said low single digit growth and specialties, lab down low single digit, and then what was US consumables and European consumables?", "Bret Wise", "US consumables for the true consumables, meaning not the small equipment component was positive low single digits, and overall with the equipment was negative low single digits. European consumables I don\u2019t have that handy, do you have that?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes it was up, mid-single digit.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Mid-single?", "Bill Jellison", "Mid-single, correct.", "", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Then just wondered if you could give me your market perspective in the specialties category, I know you said you had very strong growth in the area of implants in the US. But maybe just some more color on the market dynamics that are going on and market share that you might be gaining in that category.", "Bret Wise", "The three categories for specialties are obviously endodontics, orthodontics and implants. In implant market, we have very low market share in the US but we made some key investments, let's call two and half years ago. And I think we've made very good progress on that, and we've been kind of reporting double digit growth there, almost throughout the recession. So we are very happy with that. The implant business also continues to grow in Europe and developed Europe, as well as the emerging markets within the European community, and I think that's positive. We\u2019ve had less success in the rest of the world categories; particularly in Korea which is a market we think is contracting pretty rapidly. ", "It's a little bit difficult for us to comment on the overall market implants because we are awaiting the reports of the two largest implant players that will come in the next two or three weeks. And that will give us more insights into what's happening in the market, but with respect to our performance, we are very pleased with that. With respect to orthodontics, we had low single digit growth and appeared to be executing well there as well. I think that's probably a pretty tough market because I think orthodontics stocks are probably not up in 2009 or 2010. And we continue to grow in that category and we are happy with that. And then endodontics we had closer to mid-single digit growth, driven by some pretty strong performance across many territories. So, I think we must be taking share in that category. ", "", "Chris Clark", "Only in new products as I mentioned", "Bret Wise", "And that\u2019s driven in part by new products.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "What was the key new product there again, was it a new file?", "Chris Clark", "", "Yes, again we continue to get, as I mentioned Derek through solid traction and high both of Vortex filed in the US and also the path file, which we\u2019ve introduced globally. So those two in particular, but there were several other new product introductions but I\u2019d certainly highlight those two.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "And that was in the consumables business as you said both in Europe and in the US, your end user sales were kind of matching what you are seeing with distribution, so the channel seems to be carrying the right levels of inventory. Is that a fair statement?", "Bret Wise", "Yes, I\u2019d say there wouldn\u2019t be a whole lot of changes year-on-year in terms of channel inventories as we compare it back to last year as well. ", "Bill Jellison", "We like to see the two large distributors report so we can see what the market did. ", "Bret Wise", "Which will give us more insight into that. ", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "And then finally, just looking at your balance sheet the $340 million I think it\u2019s in cash, you have been an aggressive buyer of your stock around the price is $34 a share, I think if I take the $2.2 million I would assume you would execute that here fairly shortly $64 million for that. And then are you guys looking at any bigger acquisitions, or will the board then authorize perhaps an additional amount of stock to repurchase, or what\u2019s the feeling on that?", "Bret Wise", "Well our priorities haven\u2019t changed. The first priority is to reinvest in the business, the second one is to expand the business through business development and third priority would be share repurchases, and fourth priority is the dividend. So, I don\u2019t want to get out in front of the boards decision on whether to expand the share repurchases, in fact we exhausted what we have left. But I think it\u2019s fair to say that our priorities haven\u2019t changed.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Is there an opportunity to recapitalize some of your debt in the near term, or restructure that a little bit, get better rates?", "Bret Wise", "No, we actually just reestablished both a private placement and we also did a revolving credit agreement just in the first half of this year Derek. So we are in pretty good shape there.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "And so if I looked at your purchasing power at this point in time, if it took away the $64 million what would be your purchasing power as far as acquisitions would be concerned?", "Bret Wise", "We have a balance sheet Derek that\u2019s set on a net debt basis has almost no leverage on it. So, our purchasing power is quite substantial. ", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, it\u2019s not just limited by the financing that we currently have in place.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Okay, so I would assume may be if you had 21% debt to capital that would be a comfortable range for you?", "Bret Wise", "Well what we\u2019ve said is that our target is kind of in the mid 30\u2019s for debt to cap.", "Bill Jellison", "And we recognize we\u2019re well below that at this point, but we have a business that produces very consistent and strong cash flow and a balance sheet that could absorb much more leverage than we have on today.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair ", "Ravi Fadah - William Blair", "Hi, good morning guys this is actually Ravi Fadah in for John Kreger today. If you take a look at patient traffic trends in the US and Europe on a monthly basis, how did those trend throughout the quarter? And if you\u2019re willing to comment, what are you seeing so far in Q3?", "Chris Clark", "Yes, Ravi it\u2019s Chris, I don\u2019t know that we have got a lot of visibility through that. Obviously any state that we would have would be anecdotal, just in terms of from sales reps calling on offices as well as potentially through distributors et cetra. I would say it\u2019s pretty consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. I wouldn\u2019t say that we have seen a significant change in terms of what we thing the underlying dental market activity is. But I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re the barometer for that.", "Ravi Fadah - William Blair", "Secondly, you had mentioned that last years results, I think it was the first quarter were positively impacted by equipment promotions. Are there any plans to do any additional equipment promotions in the second half of this year?", "Bret Wise", "Let me clarify that first comment. The comment was that we had equipment promotions in the second and third quarter last year. We always have some promotions, but we had heavier promotions in the US second, third quarter last year. And I would say our promotional activity is more kind of a steady state normal level at this point.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Elliot Feldman with Barclays Capital.", "Elliot Feldman - Barclays Capital", "Just wondering how we can think about the pattern of cash flow generation for the back half of the year? And secondly, just trying to target down on the, you guys are talking about the developing world market for last spring, where you guys are seeing in those markets kind of from a broad perspective?", "Bill Jellison", "Well I think cash in general should remain pretty solid in the back half. Keep in mind in the back half of the last year we were actually pulling some inventory down, because our inventory days were higher, they were around I think 110 or so in comparison to the 100 that they are at this point. So, we probably won\u2019t get the benefit from the inventory days in the back half, but generally we should still see a good solid cash flow within that period. ", "Bret Wise", "In the developing markets I would say it\u2019s always a mixed bag, there are so many different economies within that group, but the ones that we see best positioned right now would be the Asian markets in total, and Latin America, secondly, within that category and then also some of the CIS and NDA type regions. I think the economies that have not been hit terribly hard by currency, for us at least are performing well, and those that had a significant devaluation of the currency against either euro or the dollar are not performing so well, because they got to import our products at a much higher price. So that's kind of a general comment realizing that we are talking about probably 120 countries when we generalize like that.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Scott Green with Bank of America.", "Scott Green - Bank of America", "", "To clarify, could you tell us what the mid-point of your new guidance now assume is for FX, is it around $1.30 on the euro?", "Bret Wise", "Yes, I think that that\u2019s at least a reasonable range to use. We stated that where we are at right now which is about $1.30, that that's probably a reasonable rate at least for you to assume in the back half of the year as far as our guidance is concerned.", "Scott Green - Bank of America", "Okay and then could you talk about your Barcelona implant symposium and what momentum you got from the show and how that compared to your expectations going in?", "Chris Clark", "I would say we are real pleased with the events and we continue to be pleased with the momentum after that. Obviously with that event been over 2000 attendees focused on wide range of implant solutions with specific, we are real pleased with the discussions relative to our ankylose line, and specifically the Ankylos CX and we are pleased with the follow up from that meeting in terms of momentum we have on that business. I think that\u2019s certainly helping to drive some of our implant numbers particularly in the US which we are very well placed.", "Scott Green - Bank of America", "And on Endo how would, if at all Henry Schein Brasseler combination impact your competitive position in the market?", "Bret Wise", "Well, we compete with both of them now. So I don\u2019t think it would have much impact on us. And I don\u2019t think I want to comment further on that. But those are Henry Schein is our distributor in our consumable lines and they compete with us in some of the specialty lines, and Brasseler of course competes with us primarily in consumables and in stocks.", "Scott Green - Bank of America", "And then lastly just the outlook or strategy for price increases in the back half of the year and how those might compare to 2009 levels?", "Chris Clark", "I would say that our price increase timing is very similar to what we\u2019ve done historically. We typically on consumables do take price increases at the end of the third quarter. I would say the levels again, we are still in process of finalizing those, but probably be slightly above last years levels. Like, if I had to put a number on it today it would be in the 2% plus maybe a bit range but again, we are still in the process of finalizing those.", "Scott Green - Bank of America", "Anything that we should think about in terms of seasonal progressions or you don\u2019t think it will be meaningful enough to have a significant variance over the last year\u2019s trends?", "Bret Wise", "My sense would be pretty similar to what we saw last year. ", "Operator", "And we will now take a follow-up question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Just two quick ones, Bill what was the share count exiting the quarter? I know what it was for the quarter, but exiting the quarter?", "Bill Jellison", "I don\u2019t have it handy I think you can assume roughly that it\u2019s right in the $146 million kind of range.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "How about $1 million below? ", "Bill Jellison", "Maybe like $146.5 million yes some more in that for the back half. ", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "And then was there a little restatement it seemed like Q2 \u201809 numbers shifted around a little bit, not a big impact but enough that it changed kind of my year-over-year comps.", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, we did a slight reclassification of some of the costs that we had in SG&A last year. It really all dealt with research and development or more specifically our ongoing engineering related categories. Some of those costs were previously in the R&D expense area and they should have actually been up in cost and get sold for a couple of divisions. It is about 20 to 30 basis points swing between those two categories in the back half of the year as well, which is what it was in the first half. ", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "So take H2 \u201809 gross margin down about 20, 30 bps and OpEx down about 20, 30 bps as well. ", "Bill Jellison", "That\u2019s correct.", "Operator", "At this time we have no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Bret Wise for closing remarks.", "Bret Wise", "Alright, thanks Ben. Thank you for listening in this morning we feel we are off to a good start in the first half of 2010 and have some good momentum, despite a slow recovery in the global dental market. Thanks again for calling in this morning we look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year.

Baird", "Robbie [ph] \u2013 William Blair", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Operator", "Good day, everyone and welcome to today's DENTSPLY International 2010 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bret Wise. Please go ahead, sir.", "Bret Wise", "Thank you, Clay and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our year end conference call. This is Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO and also with us today are Chris Clark, our President and COO; and Bill Jellison, our Senior Vice President and CFO. On today's call, each of us will have some prepared statements and following those remarks, we'll be glad to answer any questions you may have.", "Before we get started, it's important to note that this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings.", "The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. And a recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our Web site. ", "This morning, we are pleased to announce record performance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2010. For the fourth quarter, sales XPM were up 0.3% with constant currency growth of 2.5% and negative currency headwinds of 2.2%. The constant currency growth was comprised of 1.7% internal growth and 0.8% growth from acquisitions. ", "I think it's important to note when you look at the internal growth for the quarter, that in the third quarter conference call we commented that we thought the price increase pre-buy ahead of our October 1 price increase has probably move half a point out of the fourth quarter and into the third quarter. And on this call, we can confirm it was probably half a point or maybe just above that. ", "This quarter caps the full year of 2010 where we had sales growth, XPM of 2.1% with constant currency growth of 2.6% and currency a negative of 0.5%. The constant currency growth for the full year was comprised of internal growth of 2.1% and acquisition growth of 0.5%. ", "Based on the market data we have available to us today, these results put us at maybe the high end of what we believe the global dental consumable market grew in 2010. We'd say the feel of the market is better today than when we entered 2010 and is showing signs of gradually accelerating. However, the market has not yet returned to the historical growth pattern that we saw before the recession.", "The fourth quarter geographic and internal growth XPM was plus 0.6% in the U.S., plus 1.0% in Europe and plus 4.5% for the rest of the world. In the quarter, there was a notable improvement in the U.S. We've also benefited from positive internal growth in consumables and specialties and our non-dental segment, while lab was slightly negative. ", "For the full year internal growth was plus 0.1% or just barely positive in the U.S., plus 2.9% in Europe and plus 4.1% for the rest of the world. Internal growth for the full year kind of mirrored the pattern that I just described for the fourth quarter with positive internal growth in consumables, specialties and non-dental and a slight decline in prosthetics.", "Earnings for the fourth quarter were helped by gross margins that improved 70 basis points versus the prior year. That's measured on a sales XPM basis, while SG&A was higher as a percent of sales this quarter, performance was actually better than it may appear from this raw comparison as it was one of our best quarters over the past 10 to 12 quarters. However, we were coming up against a very low SG&A comparison from the last quarter of last year where expenses were very low. In fact that was one of the lowest ratios that we had had on record in the past decade.", "We signaled this throughout the year starting on our call in February 2010 that the comparison in the backhalf of the year on SG&A would be difficult and in fact, that's what we see emerging here. Probably a more meaningful comparison might be expenses sequentially which were 100 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2010 and 60 basis points lower than the full year average for 2010.", "Overall, on a non-GAAP EPS basis we reported a record of $0.51 a share for the fourth quarter. That's a 6.3% improvement over the prior year, which was also a record. For the full year, non-GAAP EPS was $1.90. Again, that's also a record and that compares to $1.84 in 2010, a 3.3% improvement. ", "During 2010, we completed seven business development transactions composed of primarily traditional acquisitions but also investments in new technologies and minority investments. And at last quarter of the year, we completed two transactions, including a minority investment in DIO in South Korea, which is a low cost in plant producer focused primarily on the emerging markets. ", "In addition, we entered into a strategic relationship with GlaxoSmithKline regarding dual branding and development of products to address tooth sensitivity in the professional market. That's in combination with their leading Sensodyne brand that's sold over the counter. ", "Lastly, we also signed two additional transactions near the end of the year. One of which closed in January. I'd say these are small investments and no need to adjust your models for these at this point. I would say that M&A remains our top priority for cash deployment. We had a number of possibilities we're working on but it's too early to give any guidance on timing or magnitude of those transactions at this time.", "We believe the global dental market has retuned to pre-recession levels in absolute amounts although it's not growing at the pre-recession rate. We see some very positive signs emerging in certain countries with some improvement in the U.S. Select developed markets in Europe and many parts of the developing world where we see acceleration of activity. ", "Looking ahead, we have a wave of new products coming to market. Many as we speak. We look forward to the opportunity to show and hit the market with these products first at the Chicago mid-winter show in late February and then at the International Dental Show in Cologne, Germany in late March. And Chris will describe these products more in his prepared remarks this morning. ", "We're expecting a continued slow improvement in the market in 2011 and believe we should be able to perform better than the global consumables market. In part due to this pipeline of new products we have coming to market here early in the year. ", "As we look towards performance in 2011, we expect internal growth to continue to accelerate off the 2010 rate, although we probably will not be able to return to strong mid single-digit growth at this stage. ", "In addition, subject to some stability in currency rates which have been quite voluble throughout the year we expect non-GAAP EPS to improve 5% to 10% next year putting us in the $2.08 range, which was also disclosed in our press release this morning.", "That completes my prepared remarks. I'd like to now turn the call over to Chris.", "Chris Clark", "Thank you, Bret and good morning, everyone. ", "On the new product front, innovation continues to be a key growth strategy for us. We entered 2011 with a strong new product pipeline, including several key initiatives across the different franchises. It should provide significant new product news and momentum as (inaudible) here. ", "Starting with the restorative franchise, this quarter we're launching the new ChemFil rock advanced glass-ionomer restorative. This unique patented formulation provides superior mechanical properties and a simplified placement process both of which are important for isomers which are often used in clinical situations that need speed of care or lower cost care, such as in young children, geriatric patients and emergency cases. ChemFil rock utilized advanced chemistry that delivers higher strength and improve fracture toughness over leading brands in the market today. And comes in a convenient delivery capsule to facilitate the clinical placement.   ", "The clinical technique with this product has been simplified with a fewer number of steps compared to key competitive options, including the lack of needing a cavity varnish or final coating on the restoration. Unlike most other products we introduce in the restorative area, this entry into the glass isomer category represents little cannibalization risk for us. We're real excited about the market potential both in the U.S. as well as in Europe. ", "In the endodontic area we will be launching our latest unique file and motor combination later this quarter in Europe. And likely by early in the second quarter in the U.S. This systems truly unique and offers a range of benefits to the clinician. It's patented reciprocating movement reduces the potential for file separation or breakage as the file has less stress during the root canal procedure. ", "In addition, the clinical technique is simpler. The unique motion and innovative design make it possible to shape most canals with just one instrument or file compared to three or four that are required to clean and shape the canal today. This means no time is wasted for the clinician changing instruments, which reduces the amount of time it takes to shape a canal by up to 40%.", "We will be marketing the system utilizing two different designs under the brand names WaveOne and Rexopra [ph]. We're real excited about the innovation and really believe this represents the next generation in endodontic systems. ", "We have several other key new products coming to market as we move through the year and I'll look to provide some additional insight on some of our significant innovation efforts on subsequent quarterly calls. ", "I'd like to also touch briefly this morning on a recently announced collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. This agreement involves co-branding of products containing NovaMin, which is a patent protected calcium, phosphate technology, which has been proven to relieve tooth sensitivity. By combining dense light Nupro products, which contain the NovaMin technology with GSK Sensodyne brand. We'll be providing a complete treatment solution of both in office and at home care regimens for patients suffering from dental hypersensitivity which affects a significant portion of the population today.       ", "  ", "The co-branding effort will initially result in NUPRO Sensodyne Professional prophy paste and also in Sensodyne NUPRO Professional 5000 part for million-fluoride toothpaste. These products will be launched in the U.S. later this month during the Chicago mid-winter meeting and in Europe at the upcoming IDS show in Cologne, Germany in late March. ", "We're very excited about the collaboration with GSK and look forward to the marketing impact of the combination of two very strong brand names, as well as the additional awareness and interest in NovaMin that will be generated as a result. ", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison, who will cover the financial results for the quarter and the year in greater detail. ", "Bill Jellison", "Good morning, everyone. As Bret noted, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2010 were flat with the fourth quarter of 2009 and net sales, excluding precious metal content increased 0.3% in the quarter with internal growth a positive 1.7%.

I just wanted to follow-up with you regarding some of the comments you were making about sort of market growth. It looks like, in 2010 you had about, two to 3% of sort of constant currency growth and if I sort of back out acquisitions and I back out some of your price increases. I'm trying to get a sense for where you think market growth for consumables is right now in U.S. and Europe because you kind of suggested that you're at the upper end of that band so is it fair to think that the growth rate in U.S. and Europe is pretty much right around zero?  ", "Bret Wise", "Well thank you, Glen and I think when the data points we have thus far of course are competitor announcements, some of the industry survey data that we get and of course we've seen announcements from distributors throughout the year. And I think all that data kind of confirms that the global dental consumable market probably grew in the zero to 2% in 2010. We were just right at the high end of that, 2.1% I think. For the fourth quarter, we've seen very limited disclosures so far. We've got a couple of disclosures that will come up the next 45 days from the distributors, which will be good data points. But at this point, I would say the consumable dental market is growing. It's growing low single-digits, probably not more than that but it's certainly in the positive territory.", "Glenn Santon Joe [ph] - Credit Suisse", "Okay so just a follow-up to that, embedded in your outlook then, in your prepared remarks you sort of suggested you expect 2011 to be a little bit better than that. So if I start with, let's call it maybe 3% organic growth, I mean we're looking for roughly 7% EPS growth at the mid point of your guidance and so that really doesn't give us much margin expansion. I mean do you anticipate anything going on with the margins or now that you're building up a sizable cash position, what do you anticipate doing with that cash? Is it more acquisitions or could there be something more aggressive on the share repurchase front? I'm just trying to figure out the rest of the income statement now below the revenue line.", "Bret Wise", "Yes. Thanks, Glenn.

Second, to the extent that we can execute on those and third, share repurchases and fourth, dividends and growth of the dividends.

You answered a couple of my questions in the previous answers but I'm also struggling with the internal growth rate questions and trying to figure out. This company in normal times used to grow in the 5% to 7% range and I think we're headed back to that based on everything that I'm seeing. I'm just wondering, are you guys just trying to be extra conservative here because the comparisons don't look all that tough and I'm trying to figure out why we can't grow faster internally?", "Bret Wise", "Well Derek, I think in part with our market share, we'd need to see the market pick up to the old rates of 4% to 5%. I haven't heard anyone say that that's likely in 2011. Not any of our large distributor partners, not any of our competitors. We do think that the dental consumable market will accelerate some off the rate it had in 2010. But I think it's unrealistic to expect at this point that dental consumable growth will return to kind of the 2006, 2007 rates in 2011. I think it's going to be a more gradual acceleration off the 2010 base. ", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", " ", "Okay. If we just took a look at the tier side consumables business, which category would you say is the weakest right? There must be some categories that are negative then and then just trying to gather which of those categories are the weakest and which are the strongest?", "Bret Wise", "That's a huge category with many different products in it. I would say on a relative basis that the restoratives kind of the chemical based products are stronger today than the small equipment. But I don't have a lot more guidance for you than that.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research ", "So a lot of the aesthetic products that were the weakest I think going back a year or so, have those recovered?", "Bret Wise", "In the fourth quarter, they had not fully recovered primarily because a large restocking in the base line for that product when we came off of a very substantial back order position but the market volume, meaning the sellout volumes in those products are actually picking up. Have picked up a bit.", " ", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research ", "So you're saying out the door volumes because you've got that data from your distributors in the U.S. You're seeing that grow right now? Is that right.", "Bret Wise", "Out the door volumes are growing, yes. ", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research ", "Okay. Good and then the 23% of the business that's in those emerging markets where we anticipate much stronger growth in those markets for a long period of time due to the under penetration of dental. What are you seeing there? Are those markets still also weak or are we seeing some of tier side consumables businesses there pick up?", "Bret Wise", "Just a point of correction on one of your comments. You stated that it's 23% in the emerging market. Keep in mind that that's rest of the world category for us. If you looked at just the emerging markets, actually we've grown nicely there and our emerging markets now probably represent almost 16% of our total sales. Where in the past it's been more like in the 13%, 14%. ", "But those markets have obviously helped the growth rates that have been shown in the rest of the world relative to what we talk about. Yes, we had 4.5% organic growth and the rest world category about half that emerging markets. And the emerging markets are above that rate whereas the developed markets are below that rate. ", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research ", "", "Okay, got it. So the 16, the delta there is probably Japan? Is that right?", "Bret Wise", "That's one. ", "Bill Jellison", "Canada, Australia are all in that number as well. But Japan is certainly one of the slowest growing markets. In fact it's a contracting market, in 2010 at least it was a contracting market. ", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research ", "Okay and then if I could just ask a question on the acquisitions you made here or the business development activities. Bill or Bret,  is there a strategy here? Are you heading one direction with this acquisitions or are these just a lot of different (inaudible) acquisitions that have to do with various new products, et cetera?", "Bill Jellison", "No there are strategies behind these. They're strategies for each of our franchise businesses of which we have six. And I think what you've seen is furtherance of the strategies that are developed specifically for those different business. For instance, we have some business that are sold direct in the United States but largely to distribution outside the United States. And we've been acquiring some of those sales and marketing organizations so we can go direct with those products that are more technique sensitive. ", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research ", "You said right now they're not material on an income statement basis but what about the outcome of these acquisitions, or these activities? When do we start to see maybe the payoff of some of these investments?", "Bill Jellison", "Well if you went back to the ones we did three or four years ago, we're seeing the payoff of those now. So I think this is a continual stream and if you kind of look at our acquisition activity each year you'll see us do a number of these smaller transactions. Of course we'd like to complement that with a larger transaction but the last large transaction we did now was about 14 months ago. We'd like to execute on more of those but those are, there's significant timing risk with respect to those.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research ", "Okay and then just to clarify one other thing on the guidance. The sort of 7% mid point of the range on EPS growth. That's purely internal, isn't that right?

Very good. Thanks very much. ", "", "Operator", "The next is Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies ", "Thanks. Bill, how should we think about operating cash flow and CapEx in 2011?", "Bill Jellison", "Well I think from an operating cash flow perspective we would expect that it would improve slightly in 2011. I think the CapEx side of the equation is probably going to begin moving back toward a more normal level. So prior to kind of the recessionary physicians we  were running in the $65, $70 million range. I think that that's probably more of a realistic expectation for 2011 than the $44 million that you saw in 2004.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies", " ", "Okay and then Bill or Bret. What are your largest competitors in consumables recently point to step up in it's R&D commitment? I'm just curious if you witnessed any material changes in the competitive environment and as a corollary how should we think about R&D spending plans for next year? ", "Bret Wise", "Well our strategy when we went into the recession was not to cut our R&D spend so we held it constant. We kind of took that off the table. We weren't going to look for cost reductions in that area. And I think that's why we kind of got this large pipeline of products that are going to come to market in 2011. So we're continuing to spend on R&D as a priority. I think our competitors have always spent a lot on R&D. I think some of our larger competitors are very innovative companies.

", "", "Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital", "Thanks. Good morning, Bret, Chris and Bill. Let me just follow-up on a couple of things if I could and if you could take about it? So just to maybe beat on this internal growth drum a bit more. You're talking about zero to 2% global dental consumables growth as you see it, in the marketplace. Can you elaborate how you are thinking of that U.S., Europe and rest of the world as you define it either as you're seeing it now or how you're thinking about it for 2011?", "Bill Jellison ", "And keep in mind that the zero to 2% is what we think happened in 2010, not necessarily what will happen in 2011. I think, generally speaking you're going to be seeing the growth accelerate in the U.S. somewhat in 2011 over 2010. In Europe, I'm less confident that we'll see accelerated growth in 2011 versus 2010 because Europe actually had a reasonably good year in 2010. And rest of the world, I think we're going to continue to see the emerging markets grow kind of  high single-digits for us. And the other developed countries in the rest of the world, I think we\u2019ve seen good growth in those ex-Japan. And whether the Japanese dental market will turnaround and start to grow in 2011, I think is a question mark in our minds still at this point. ", "Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital", "And as you say, the way you break out your divisions. You're not going to see necessarily that emerging market number spring out because it's gets somewhat diluted because of Japan more than anything else?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes and also a small piece of the emerging markets is in the European number, which is the CIS. We have it in the Latin American countries in one segment. We've got Asia Pacific in a separate segment and the CIS in, actually in the same segment as Asia Pacific. ", "Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital", "So just to follow it. Brett, I know you said to me and others that your business model really works well when you get a couple of percent of internal growth, help you leverage your fixed costs that you have globally. And I guess the way you're thinking about 2011, you're not going to really see that kind of pickup to most appropriately leverage of fixed cost. Is your view, let's stand steady so that by 2012, we're going to get that pick up so that you start to get that nice margin expansion you've seen so much in the past? ", "", "Bret Wise", "I think in 2011. I mean, obviously throughout the last two years when the market was down. We weren't standing still. We were implementing cost reduction programs to try to expand margins when we came out of the recession. As we look to 2011, we think we'll return to some margin expansion. We're not confident we would get back to the high-end range we had seen pre-recession but we think with a little bit of organic growth we can get some margin expansions. It just probably won't be as robust as maybe we saw in the 2006, 2007 timeframe.", "Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital", "Two other things. I know that you and Chris had talked a lot about the pipeline of products. (inaudible) some of the products you discussed, the (inaudible) file, the NUPRO product line, ChemFil, so it seems really interesting. You've talked about other products. How do we think about that? How do we quantify how you're thinking of contribution here in 2011 relative to how it moves the needle in internal growth or other ways?", "", "Chris Clark", "Larry, it's Chris. I think obviously we're excited about those innovations and I think they are going to have an impact on the marketplace for us. A big, huge new product in dental would be a $5 million product. From that angle $5 million on our overall base, we need several of those to move the needle in aggregate. ", "So I think what you're going to see with that, we're excited about the innovations, I think that's factored into our guidance here. That's partially why we think we should be able to do better than we think the markets going to do. And, again we'll just have to see as the year unfolds but we're excited about the pipeline and the one's we've launched and the one's we've got coming.", "Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital", "The message though is relative to most years, the new product pipeline should give you a little bit more boost this year because the number of products introduced? Is that a fair way to look at it? ", "Chris Clark", "I'm optimistic about it. Yes. ", "Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital", "Two other things then. You know Brett, the other drum to beat on acquisitions. Again, you guys have had a great track record of adding businesses. I think Bret you talked about building a foreign team with other smaller company's being able to add. You mentioned the last bigger acquisition you made 14 months. For a number of reasons, timing, et cetera, if we need to have this conversation in 12 months, and you hadn't done anything of any larger size, how disappointed would you be as a manager or would you just say look, timing is something we can't fully control? ", "Bret Wise", "Well, I'd be disappointed but I probably would say timing is something we can't control. And also the acquisitions, we have some pretty disciplined metrics we use on acquisitions. We want to make sure they're going to add value to our portfolio. We're not doing them just to get bigger. So we're reasonably selective and because of that timing becomes more of a risk, I think. But I'll be disappointed if we don't have some pickup in acquisition activity in 2011.  ", "Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital", "And it's also just on timing Bill. Your normal to IDS. You don't see much variation usually your second quarter is your strongest  in size but this year, is there any seasonality we should be aware of and remind us again what the tax rate we should be using for '011? ", "Bill Jellison", "Yes the IDS is something that happens every two years. That's not something that kind of moves the needle on our overall performance or within a period. So, no we don't, quarter to quarter. as we move though the year, our sales levels are relatively tight from a volatility perspective. We may see some movement in some of the quarters but very, very minor.", "Larry Marsh - Barclays Capital", "And tax rate, Bill?", "Bill Jellison", "And the tax rate for the year we think is going to be somewhere in the 25%, 25.5% range.

Bill, you said internal growth was 1.7% in the period. Can you repeat the geographic breakouts please?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes. I've got it. It's 0.6% in the U.S., 1.0% in Europe and 4.5% rest of the world for the quarter.", "", "Scott Green - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay and you said that pre-volume could have been around the 50 basis point headwind in the quarter? Is that right?", "", "Bill Jellison", "Well I said. I think on the pre-volume side, the comment that Bret made there was really associated with the price side of the equation. But as far as changes in overall merchandising related level I think on an adjusted basis we would think that the sales in the quarter were probably about a half to a full percentage point, kind of lower than what would have been a reflected if the same levels would have gone through the channel.

Is that mostly driven by market share gains or better consumer spending patterns or maybe if you could just elaborate on what you're seeing?", " ", "Bill Jellison", "I made that comment Scott, so let me elaborate a little bit. My comment there was basically driven by end user market demand trends during the quarter or during the last half of the year. I think that it felt better late in the year than it did earlier in the quarter or even the quarter before, so we saw some pick up in end user demand kind of late in the year here which we view positively.", "Scott Green - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay and your outlook for kind of a better trajectory going forward? Is that just based on better end user demand and kind of stable employment levels?", "Bill Jellison", "", "I think it's based on a couple thinks. One is current trends we've seen. Second, is that it seems to us at this point that  all the bad news is kind of baked into the baseline. We don't see the unemployment increasing from here which is what we've had to fight with for some time. It seems to be more stable. We seem to see some pickup in economic trends so from our perspective, it kind of looks like the bad news is in the baseline and any improvements from here should start to emerge in our numbers sometime during 2011.", "Scott Green - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That's great and then what was the growth by specialty category in the period?", "Bill Jellison", "Well, we don't usually give that breakdown in a lot of detail but in plants were a mid single-digit growth for the quarter.

Baird.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you. Good morning, guys. Hey, wondering if we can start maybe on Europe first. The 1% organic growth there may be a little softer than we were looking for, specially as you came up against easier comp. Was there anything Brett, maybe run off of budget year end or anything that pressured spending there? I know you talk about maybe Europe not getting better next year but is there still reason to believe you can at least maintain that 3% organic rate in 2011?", "Bret Wise", "Well a couple of things on Europe for us this quarter. One is that when we spoke to the price increases October 1, we moved one large segment of our business from a January 1 price increase to an October 1 price increase in 2010. And thus this impacted the price increases as disproportionately larger in Europe than it is in the rest of the world on this one particular quarter.", "A second issue is in Germany. And I think this is what you were alluding to kind of early in the quarter in October there were announcements made by many of the regions in Germany that they had fully depleted their reimbursement budget for dental. And thus they suspended the dental reimbursement for the remainder of the calendar year. That, I think had a modest effect or somewhat of an effect in the fourth quarter. ", "Looking at 2011, we're reasonably optimistic about Germany, excuse me about Europe, that it can continue to grow kind of inline with what it did in 2011, excuse me 2010. I don't think we're going to see perhaps as much an economic pickup in Europe because Europe grew in 2010 and looks pretty stable at this point. But I believe our markets should be stable to improving in Europe for 2011 and in particular, we saw recovery in the CIS region in 2010. We think that's going to continue. ", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Fair. And one follow-up there. The German budget, I think is up 1% or 2% for dental this year? Is that correct? So there shouldn't be any year-over-year negative impact from that?", "Bret Wise", "Yes. We shouldn't have any year-over-year negative impact. And hopefully they won't run out of reimbursements in certain states late in the year. ", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Okay and then on the gross margin front, Bill. I hear what you guys are saying, that operating margin maybe doesn't get back to normalized 30 to 50 basis points for the year but can be up year-over-year. On the gross margin side, six quarters in a row of kind of tough gross margin trends and then we've got stabilization last quarter. A nice pickup this quarter. Should we expect that the gross margin line, those improvements continue and it's just some higher SG&A to support the new products and what have you that weigh on the operating line a little bit? ", "Bill Jellison", "Again. No, I'd say from an SG&A perspective, the reason why it weighed in the fourth quarter on SG&A was really because of the tough comp from last year. I think as you look at 2011, I think what you should generally expect is that SG&A for the year is probably not going to be improving or hurt much as a percent of sales and that any improvement that you do see on the operating margin line is going to probably come in a gross margin area.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, so gross margin be up to maybe 10 to 20 basis points that you guys were kind of alluding to there but not the 40, 50 basis points that we've seen in some past years? ", "Bill Jellison", "Yes and I think that's probably reasonable, at least at this stage unless there's a broader economic recovery that helps some of the other product categories.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Okay and two last follow-ups here if I could. Bret, you mentioned that implants were up mid single-digits. You didn't talk on it so I'm assuming that was still down for the quarter? Then maybe any visibility there? And then also, Bill, on the interest expense line obviously with the DIO investment, does interest expense, or net interest expense kick down because those bonds help the interest income for the year? Is that a fair way to think about it?", "Bret Wise", "First on the orthodontics Jeff. It was relatively flat in the quarter. Stronger outside the U.S. than inside the U.S. and you have the interest? ", "Bill Jellison", "Sure. On the interest side, yes you should expect a little bit of an interest improvement in 2011. And the majority of that, or a good piece of that anyway is coming from the interest associated with the DIO convertible bond that we're getting.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "All right. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "", "The next is John Gregor with William Blair.", "John Gregor - William Blair", "Hi. Good morning, guys. This Robbie [inaudible) [ph] in for John today. Just on the organic growth that you talked about for 2011, can you tell us what the assumption is for price versus unit trend in that number?", "Bill Jellison", "Sure. First off, we really didn't give any specific guidance on what we thought the overall sales growth was going to be for 2011 specifically but within that number I'd say it's reasonable for you to assume that price is going to be, probably a positive 1.5 two percentage points, some where in that range on average. ", "Some lines are obviously a little bit heavier than that and some a little bit lighter. But I think that that's kind of the overall expectation and I think that based off of that and based off of the comment that we would expect that sales growth is probably going to be at least a little bit better than it is in 2010. You should expect there's some positive overall volume growth in there as well.", "Robbie [ph] - William Blair", "Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then I'm not sure if you're able to disclose this or not but can you tell us what percentage of total revenues that Japan alone makes up?", "Bill Jellison", "I think it's 3% to 4%. ", "Robbie [ph] - William Blair", "", "3% to 4%?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes.", "Robbie [ph] - William Blair", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much.", "Bill Jellison", "You bet.", "Operator", "", "The next is Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review ", "Yes, good morning.", "Bret Wise", "Good morning.", "Bill Jellison", "Good morning, Greg ", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review ", "", "Your cash positions are $540 million, I think it is. Where is that located geographically?", "Bill Jellison", "All of that is over in Europe so we don't really have any U.S. cash. ", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review ", "Okay and of your main categories, the specialty consumables lab. Can you give a percentage of what those represent of the total sales? ", "Bill Jellison", "", "Sure. Consumables for the year were 35%. Lab was 16% and specialties was 46%. And that's all on an XPM basis.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review ", "Okay and that's for the year?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes. In the balance it will become, (inaudible) not dental.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review ", "Okay. And one final one, on your debt, can you remind us of the debt structure and maturities that you may have coming up?", "Bill Jellison", "Sure. We've put in some, we updated our revolver last year. We did a private placement last year which was a five-year one and keep in mind that that private placement lock in, obviously was one of the factors on the interest rate side that jumped our rate during that period. But from an overall debt perspective, we're in pretty good shape from the standpoint of needing to refinance anything for at least a couple years yet. ", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review ", "All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "That's all the time we have for questions today. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Wise for closing remarks.", "", "Bret Wise", "Well, thank you for joining us this morning.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Derek Leckow", "Thanks very much Caitlyn, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for DENTSPLY\u2019s second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. I am here with Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, our President and COO; and Bill Jellison, our Senior Vice President and CFO. I hope you all had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is available on our website at www.dentsply.com.", "Before we get started, it is important to note this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. And a recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.", "I would now like to turn the call over to DENTSPLY\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Bret Wise. Bret?", "Bret Wise", "Thank you Derek, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call. This morning we\u2019re very pleased to announce record results for our second quarter of 2011. As noted in our release this morning, we experienced higher total sales growth rates and improved earnings performance in the quarter even in a phase of the headwinds that we\u2019re facing from our supply disruption in orthodontics.", "From a revenue perspective, we recorded total sales growth ex-precious metals of 8.7% which is the highest growth rate that we\u2019ve had since the Q4 of 2009. Our constant currency growth was approximately 1% that includes approximately 0.1% from internal growth and the remainder from acquisitions. These figures are inclusive of our Japanese and orthodontics businesses. If we look at our internal growth excluding sales in the Japanese markets and orthodontics, the internal growth rate was 3.4% and constant currency growth was over 4%.", "This reinforces our belief that the global dental market continue to slowly improve and while still not back to the long-term potential of the market, it\u2019s certainly moving in the right direction. Currency provided a welcome relief this quarter as you know, offsetting the headwinds from Japan and orthodontics as both the euro and the Swiss franc gained strength over the dollar versus the prior year quarter to add 7.8% from currency overall. Geographic internal growth was negative 0.9% in the U.S., negative 0.8% in Europe and plus 2.3% in the rest of the world. And of course these growth rates include or reflect the decline in the orthodontics business which was down more than 20% in our key markets.", "That was offset by positive internal growth across the rest of our business from the aggregate in particular endodontics and restoratives which were quite strong and our non-dental business which also continues to recover. Excluding orthodontics and Japan, our internal sales growth rate was approximately 2% in both U.S. and Europe and was about 9% outside the United States. Just a quick note on Europe, the growth rate ex-ortho and ex-Japan here slowed from about 4% in the first quarter to about 2% this quarter. Looking at the calendar, I think there is a couple of reasons while there may have been some acceleration into the first quarter at the expense of Q2 here.", "The first is the timing of the Eastern Holidays which impacted Q1 more last year and Q2 and its entirety this year. Also the IDS which is the largest dental show in the world was held in the last week of March in Germany. We had a very strong performance at that show and now we believe we may have borrowed a little bit of sales from Q2 and put that into Q1 as result of that show performance. Accordingly at this point, we think it\u2019s more meaningful to look at the first half growth rate of around 3% figure versus the second quarter.", "In the rest of world, we had very strong growth in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East and Canada and as expected during the circumstances we were negative in Japan. Overall, we believe the consumable dental markets are stable and slowly progressing towards more normal growth rates. We continue to be very pleased with our performance here including the introduction of numerous new products and the launch results we have from those so far this year.", "With regard to earnings, we\u2019re very pleased with the record results we had for Q2. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis grew 6.1% to $0.52 from $0.49 a year ago and grew 10% from a non-GAAP basis to $0.55 from $.50 a year ago. There are several moving parts in these numbers and of course Bill Jellison will give you more of the details. Just a few highlights here though. First is that we had a $0.03 per share reduction in earnings versus the prior year quarter due to our businesses that were impacted by the circumstances in Japan, mainly our Japanese subsidiaries and also our global orthodontics business.", "Chris will give you more insights into the status of our contingency plans however I\u2019d like to note as we did in our first quarter call. And this negative impact will grow in the third quarter perhaps by double the impact in Q2 or more before starting to recover late in the year and early next year. So as you look at the next quarter, we expect that impact to increase. Also in the quarter, we had a stronger improvement in our tax rate, Bill will speak to this further but this is an ongoing improvement that should benefit us for several years.", "I think the point here is that the negative impacts from the events in Japan were essentially offset by the positive impacts from the tax rate at least in this quarter. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re very pleased with results particularly our team\u2019s execution on bringing several new products in the market and also our progress implementing the recovery plans for orthodontics. Outside the financial results, as you know we recently announced the agreement to acquire Astra Tech AB from AstraZeneca. At this time we filed all the necessary regulatory filings and we received clearance thus far from Germany. So we\u2019re still waiting clearance in the U.S. and in two other markets and we continue to believe this transaction will close before year-end.", "As noted in our earlier release, we\u2019re excited about this opportunity as it\u2019s expected to increase our sales base globally by about 25%. It will double our implant business globally. It will increase our presence in digital industry and we will also be gaining access to another category of medical devices represented by primarily by urology. We believe this transaction will allow us to bring improved alternatives to our customers and also deliver improved opportunities for our stakeholders.", "In addition to Astra Tech, I would note that we\u2019ve completed three other transactions this year, two in Europe and one in the United States. Generally speaking, these are smaller companies, however we are excited about a technology company that we acquired here in the United States called AMD Lasers. This was acquired late in the second quarter and its one of the leading laser companies in the United States for using dental surgery. And it gives us access to a category that we had not previously participated in.", "One quick comment on cash flow is in cash deployment. We did continue to deliver strong cash flow generation in the quarter and I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that throughout market cycles. This year, we\u2019ve grown our operating cash flow at close to 10%. Currently our balance sheet is essentially debt free on a net-debt basis. With the Astra Tech transaction, of course we\u2019ll continue our reinvestment in company through R&D, sales force expansion, etcetera. However debt reduction becomes a higher priority in the near term as we expect to rapidly de-lever the balance sheet following this transaction.", "This seems like an opportune time to increase our debt with borrowing cost that are currently quite low and to more efficiently use our cash outside the United States. On earnings guidance for the year, you saw in the release that we\u2019re increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full-year from a $1.86 to $1.98 which we had established in April to new full-year guidance of $1.92 to $2.00. This guidance reflects our views on the continued strong operating performance including the improvement of tax rate. Current foreign currency exchange rates, our current thinking on the orthodontics supply situation and it excludes any impacts from the Astra Tech acquisition.", "So that concludes my prepared marks. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Chris, who will give us some further insights on operational changes related to orthodontics business in Japan and also comment on our new product pipeline. Chris?", "Chris Clark", "Thank you, Bret and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to take the next few moments and revise in deeper insights into our progress on the orthodontic front as well as an update on our progress of our new products. As you will recall, we commented on our first quarter call in April, about the impact of Japanese natural disaster on our global orthodontics business.", "For the second quarter the impact is pretty much as we expected, as we were able to service customers well into the quarter through our pre-existing stock positions. And then we saw the negative impact worsen noticeably later in the quarter as our inventories were completed. On a positive note we\u2019ve moved forward with our alternative sourcing initiatives and began receiving products from other suppliers in June [ph], marketed under the Resolve brand name, these products addressed the non self-ligating portion of our portfolio.", "We assumed the very early days of introducing these products in establishing the Resolve brand. However we\u2019re pleased with the initial customer assessments regarding this product offering in the past. On an even more positive note, we\u2019ve also just received some initial self-ligating product shipments from our Japanese manufacturer that were produced at their new manufacturing site outside of the impacted region in Japan. You will recall that we are not able to source our self-ligating line from alternative suppliers as these products are highly specialized and exactly the product is not available from other sources.", "Although these initial volumes that we received in this point are limited, and it does not noticeably change our near-term visibility of re-supply. We are encouraged by the development and see as a very positive sign that adds confidence to our previous estimate of being able to resume full supply early next year. In terms of the impact on our P&L as I mentioned earlier, the second quarter impact was pretty much as we had anticipated, looking forward to the third and fourth quarters, we do see the negative impact increasing further is expected likely to level double the Q2 effect as we are no longer \u2013 but we no longer had the pre-existing stock levels to support our customers.", "While the alternatively sourced products and that smaller initial shipment from our Japan suppliers are helpful, we continue to believe that the impact of the supply situation will not go into Q3 and likely have a similar effect in Q4 depending on how quickly we\u2019re going to return to market. We do anticipate the sales trends will improve once our Japanese supplier is able to develop additional capacity, particularly with respect for our self-ligation product line.", "Before moving off ortho I would like to emphasize a point that we had made on the first quarter call. We are committed in the orthodontics arena for the long-term and we are viewing the current supply situation caused by the events in Japan through that lens. While we\u2019ve implemented some restructuring initiatives to address our cost structure on the business, we\u2019ve taken special care to ensuring that we\u2019ve got the right organization in place to lead us back to above \u2013 strong above market growth as our supply situation improves.", "And that while we\u2019ve taken some actions to impress our fixed cost structure, we have retained a disproportionate amount of our infrastructure as we view that this is necessary to return the business to market position overtime. Moving beyond ortho, I commented on our last couple of quarterly calls about our excitement with what we view as a particularly large particularly strong new product pipeline. Consistent with those comments, we\u2019re pleased to introduce several important new brands in the second quarter in addition to the Resolve line of orthodontic practice and accessories that I commented on earlier.", "I\u2019ll comment on just two of these this morning. First in the endodontics area, we continued to expand our introduction of the reciprocating file and motor system with the expansion to the U.S. market late in the second quarter. We\u2019re extremely pleased with customer reaction to this mission globally and despite significantly expanding our manufacturing capacity, we remained challenged in the short-term to support the full-level of customer demand.", "These systems are marketed under the Wave One and Reciproc brand names and help to reduce the potential for file separation or breakage while also delivering a much simpler clinical technique that reduces the time to shape the canal by up to 40%. Also in the second quarter, our European prosthetics business introduced the new Cercon HT or highly translucent Zirconia that represents the next generation of aesthetics for the Zirconia platform combining the outstanding translucent \u2013 with the proven stability of the Cercon base, it can be used for fully contoured crowns and bridges even in the posterior region.", "Further testing is shown even less wear on opposing teeth than traditional porcelains used in metal in glass-ceramic restorations. We anticipate introduction in the U.S. before year-end once we receive regulatory approval. In addition to the new products introduced in the second quarter, we remain very pleased with customer acceptance to the innovations we launched earlier in the year. And particularly, we\u2019re very pleased with our early reactions of the two other major introductions in the endodontics franchise namely the Gutted Core [ph] Obturation System and the Qmix 3in1 irrigating solution. The other was the reciprocating file and motor system these products really have begun to define the next generation of root canal therapy.", "We\u2019re also very pleased with the market acceptance of the ChemFil rock advanced glass-ionomer restorative with the superior mechanical properties and simple file placement process. Our early assessment is that this product will help us to gain a solid foothold in glass-ionomer category with minimal cannibalization risk to our existing restorative product lines. Finally looking forward, I would comment on the R&D portfolio, in terms of the pipeline remains strong and I look forward to providing you with additional updates on these new launches as in other upcoming introductions as we move forward to future quarterly calls.", "And I would like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison who will cover the financial results for the quarter in greater detail.", "Bill Jellison", "Good morning everyone, Bret covered most of our sales numbers but I\u2019d like to add on couple of observations. First our geographic mix of sales ex-precious metals in the second of 2011 included the U.S. at 35%, Europe represented 42% and the rest of world was 23% of sales. Our sales mix has shifted somewhat for the OUS business due in part to the weakening of the dollar and the loss on business within the orthodontic area.", "As you know, the weaker dollar in the second quarter which benefited our top line growth by 7.8%, our earnings per share are also benefiting from the translation benefits of a weaker dollar but are being partially offset by higher transaction related impacts as we sell many products produced in Europe to other parts of the world. This is negatively impacting our gross profit margin rates in the period. The sales and earnings impacts are consistent with potential impacts laid out in our investor relations presentation and a current exchange rates we expect the top and bottom line impacts will continue to be positive for the rest of the year. However, they would probably run slightly lower than those experienced in the second quarter.", "Growth profit margins as a percentage of sales ex-precious metal content in the second quarter of 2011 were 55.8% compared to 55.4% for the second quarter of 2010. When compared to the same period last year, we were positively impacted by improved pricing and favorable impacts from the integration of acquisitions which were partially offset by negative impacts of foreign exchange. The negative impact of foreign exchange rates and the gross margin rate in the quarter was approximately 20 basis points. SG&A expenses were $211 million or 37.4% of sales ex-precious metals in the second quarter of 2011 versus 35.2% in the prior year second quarter. These expenses were higher than those in last year\u2019s second quarter when measured as a percent of sales as we have maintained our investment in the orthodontic business, despite the recent decline in sales volumes from the disruption of supply.", "This will continue to result in higher SG&A rates throughout the year and will impact us hardest in the third and fourth quarter of the year as volumes decline in orthodontics, well lately be more significant in those periods. We are also investing around key product launch this year to support new product growth and have this impact the SG&A ratio would have been around 36% on sales ex-precious metals. Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals were 17.2% compared to 20.2% last year in the same period. Operating margins based on the sales excluding precious metals for comparative purposes excluding acquisition related activities and restructuring and other costs in both periods would have been 18.5% in the second quarter of 2011 and 20.3% in 2010.", "These rates were also negatively impacted this year as we are supporting our orthodontic business despite decline in sales from the lack of product supply in this category. While we are beginning to see some supply begin to come back in this area, we do not expect to see real improvements until products supply is returned to normal which we believe may not occur until the first half of 2012. As we move into the back half of the year, we expect the impacts of the orthodontic product supply constrains will have a greater negative impact on the sales, operating margin rates and earnings per share as we experience the full impact of the supply chain disruption and the process of supporting this business through the rebuilding process.", "As Bret noted, the impact from the Japanese disaster in Q2 was a negative $0.03 per share. This impact will likely be closer to a negative $0.06 to $0.07 per share in both the third and fourth quarters of this year before it begins to improve. Net interest and other expenses in the second quarter was $4.6 million compared to $6.6 million last year in the second quarter. This reduction in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest income associated with higher interest income and credit risk adjustment on the outstanding derivatives, which we highlighted as an adjustment for our non-GAAP earnings per share. It was slightly benefited by higher interest income on our cash balances as rates have increased slightly from last year.", "The corporate cash rate in the second quarter of 2011 was approximately 18.8% and year-to-date is now 22.4%. This is a nice reduction from last year and is a result of two items. First, we are benefiting from a more favorable geographic mix, as our U.S. based income has been reduced due to the impacts of a weaker dollar and the negative impacts of our supply outage of orthodontic products. We expect this impact to gradually go away as our sales and earnings in this business are rebuilt over the next few years. We are also benefiting from the recently announced acquisition of Astra Tech. With this acquisition we will be able to more effectively deploy our cash flow as a result much less cash will be repatriated to the U.S., which will result in a lower average tax rate in 2011 similar to our year-to-date rate of 22% to 23%. And for several years moving forward based on the current tax laws.", "The announced acquisition of Astra Tech allows us to efficiently utilize not only our current cash balances but also our future foreign cash flows. Equity and net income attributable to unconsolidated affiliated company reflects our investment in non-consolidated businesses. The income shown is primarily the result of the increased work and value of the convertible bond we hold in deal. This bond is fair value adjusted each quarter. Any gain or loss from that change in value is being treated as a non-GAAP item by us. The opposite impact of that valuation change is reflected in our financials. However, it is run through OCI, not our income statement until we convert the bonds, at which time it will run through our P&L but we will also flag that item as a non-GAAP adjustment.", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the second quarter of 2011 was $74.2 million or $0.52 per diluted share compared to $72.4 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010. Net income attributable to DENTSPLY on an adjusted non-GAAP basis was $78.5 million or $0.55 per diluted share in 2011 compared to $73.9 million or $0.50 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010. Cash flow from operating activities in the first half of 2011 was $165 million compared to $150 million in the same period last year, a 10% increase. Capital expenditures were $25 million in the first half of the year with depreciation and amortization at around $37 million.", "Capital expenditures are currently expected to be in the $60 million to $70 million range for the year. Inventory days were 110 at the end of the second quarter of 2011 compared to 110 days at the end of the first quarter and 103 days at the end of last year. Approximately six of those days however is just the result of our higher FX impacts. We do not \u2013 we do some expect some additional improvement in the inventory levels by end of the year and really in fourth quarter. Accounts receivable days were 60 days at the end of the second quarter of 2011 compared to 57 days at the end of the second quarter in 2010.", "At the end of the second quarter of 2011, we had $672 million in cash and short term investments. Total debt was $663 million at the end of the second quarter. Year-to-date we have repurchased approximately $80 million of our stock or approximately $2.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $36. Based on the company\u2019s authorization remain up to 34 million shares of primary stock, we now have approximately 12 billion shares available for repurchase.", "However as we have recently announced in our intent to acquire Astra Tech, we are now planning on repurchasing additional shares until we make some reasonable reductions in the debt used to complete that transaction. Finally, based on our performance in the first half, our gradual improvement in our underlying markets, continued benefits of a weak dollar and our current assessment of our orthodontic contingency plan, we are adjusting our 2011 full-year earnings per diluted share guidance to $1.92 to $2.00 on a non-GAAP basis excluding certain adjustments. This guidance also excludes a potential impact from our recently announced plans to acquire Astra Tech.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Thanks for your support. And we\u2019d be glad to answer any questions that you may at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will pause for a moment to assemble the queue. We\u2019ll go first to Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert Baird", "Thank you. Good morning guys.", "Chris Clark", "Good morning.", "Bret Wise", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert Baird", "Chris, you gave the Japanese update, so I guess either for you or Bret, we have been hearing you were getting some low tech supplies or probably not the right way to say it but, if some of the value products may be out of there but not the high-end self-ligating stuff. We thought you were may be subject or your supplier was subject to MHLW approval for manufacturing lines. Has that happened? And how do we think about the gaining if you\u2019ve got manufacturing in place this approved, why take another two full quarters to start getting that, what\u2019s kind of the rate limiting factor there?", "Bret Wise", "Hi Jeff, this is Bret. I\u2019ll take a stab at this and if Chris may add some things to add to this. But with respect to product supply, yes, we\u2019ve gotten a trickle of supply I\u2019ll call it, too small shipments one on the non self-ligating product and recently we got actually a small shipment of the self-ligating product. The Japanese supplier is up and running on a very limited basis. They had some equipment installed and approved for export business to us. We shouldn\u2019t assume though that because we have this small trickle supply that they\u2019ve got all the equipment in place validated and ready to go and all the labor trained, because of course they had to do \u2013 they were having to replace some of their labor on this location. So this is going to be an ongoing process.", "We do think \u2013 we\u2019ll stiff back to see this continue to improve although I don\u2019t think it will be linear. And this is one of those times that we\u2019ll have to give you an update when we had the third quarter call. At this point, I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume we will have limited supply in the back half of the year, not nearly the supply we had in the second quarter of course, because we had full inventories coming into the second quarter which was now completed. So I think this is going to be more of a process than an event of slow rebuilding of the capacity.", "Chris Clark", "Yes, Jeff just to add, I mean I think what it does for me is provide a greater confidence on the earlier comments, we\u2019ve said that we think that by early next year, we\u2019re going to be back up and running and they are going to be back up and running in terms of basically full supply.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert Baird", "All right. And Bret I guess, what are you hearing early on from your orthodontics at this point. When we talk about orthodontics there is a lot of them like to just buy everything from one group and understanding the Resolve brand could help mitigate some of the losses. Do you feel like most of your customers are just going to ship their purchasing to a competitor in the near term and not kind of bifurcate their purchasing to the Resolve brand and then get their high end stuff elsewhere. How are you thinking that\u2019s going to play out in the next few months to quarters?", "Bret Wise", "I think that\u2019s yet to be seen. We have very good relationships with our customers. Some of our customers of course don\u2019t buy the self-ligating, they only buy the other series of products. I think with those customers, we\u2019ve got a strong position and we\u2019re probably we\u2019ll keep that market share. With respect to one \u2013 customers that we\u2019re primarily using self-ligating that we\u2019re not able to try self-ligating, I think you\u2019ll see a shift we called this temporary to one of the suppliers. And then of course, there is customers out there that have a mix and I wouldn\u2019t expect us to lose all those customers that have a mix between self-ligating and the more traditional twin brackets, I think that we\u2019re going to be able to compete at least in those with those orthodontics in the near term.", "The other way I am thinking about it is that we start to get some supply back, of course we\u2019ll be back in those offices with some limited offerings. And I think we need to keep in mind that the reason I used our brackets is because they like them best. So that\u2019s going to play I think favorable for us as we go to rebuilt our market share here. My only other comment is I kind of alluded to in the commentary is that of course we haven\u2019t taken out the sales and marketing infrastructure this business that we were fully maintaining that. We\u2019re maintaining the relationships with the orthodontics. We\u2019re in their offices, with the alternative offerings.", "And I think that will help in recovery of the business and demonstrate self-commitments in longer term.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert Baird", "All right, great. And then one question on Europe and then maybe just a model question for Bill, but on Europe, Bret can you kind of give us an update on kind of the gaining throughout the quarter, maybe July so far, there is obviously a lot of concerns that are being raised across Europe in healthcare in general and that hearing good things at IDS in March, but may be started to taper off from there the number this quarter sequentially declined, I think for some reason you give us that makes sense but how are you thinking about Europe I guess in the second half?", "Bill Jellison", "Usually we don\u2019t talk about months within a quarter, I think that\u2019s dangerous to do because it\u2019s difficult enough to measure business on 90 days when you\u2019re on 30 days but with respect to this quarter, we saw the quarters turn our recently weak in April as we talk to our businesses and why that was, we\u2019ve got the explanation as well for Easter Holidays. They\u2019ve shut down and that affect we\u2019ll see our customers shut down. That effect was mainly in the March last year.", "Also we didn\u2019t have IDS in March last year. We had it in this year. So that probably pulled some business out of it growing into March. And then sequentially we saw the quarter the operating performance improved throughout the rest of the quarter. And so if you looked at May and June you see much more normal ratios and growth rates compared to what we saw in April.", "So I don\u2019t think we like music, we\u2019re just talking about one quarter or another quarter I think that\u2019s what happened in the second quarter. As far as the overall business in Europe, we don\u2019t see a dramatic change or what we seeing for the last we\u2019ll say 18 months, the business appears to be solid. Of course it varies by country. Some of the countries in southern Europe where we\u2019ve got severe budget problems I think are having a much harder time and those in Northern Europe. But I guess I would conclude it by saying, although we had this impact on our results in April, we don\u2019t see those will change outside of that impact.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert Baird", "Okay, well that\u2019s encouraging. Thank you. And then Bill, I guess then just a modeling question. EPS in the quarter, if top line impacted by 7% or 8% doing the typical math that you guide you one-third to two-thirds flowing through, probably $0.02 to $0.03 impact this quarter. Is that kind of how think about the next half of the year may be $0.02 to $0.04 total in the second half, since you said that lower and then anything in your guidance in that $0.04 or $0.05 raise to the midpoint of guidance, anything different in there from an FX or tax rate standpoint or how much is the FX and tax rate contributing to the rates in guidance?", "Bill Jellison", "Well I would say the tax rates we just stated that we\u2019re expecting that lower tax rate not only through the rest of this year but kind of moving forward. So you can definitely expect as a tax rate as piece of that benefit some FX benefit, you know obviously we had FX projections for the year based on different levels, but I\u2019d say that that\u2019s had a little bit more favorable despite the negative impacts that we\u2019re getting from the higher Swiss francs and the product that we sell out of Switzerland which is a lot of our endodontics related supplies that are hurting us, that\u2019s why our gross margin rate is actually negatively being impacted by the FX despite the fact that we are still seeing a positive bottom line impact on foreign FX both during the second quarter. And I would agree in the last half of the year, it should \u2013 we still remain positive based on current rates within each of those periods.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert Baird", "All right, thanks guys.", "Bret Wise", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Block with SunTrust Robinson.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust Robinson", "Great, thanks and good morning.", "Bret Wise", "Hi Jonathan.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust Robinson", "Good morning, may be just the first one, a quick follow-up on Japan and I know I am a getting a little bit specific but it seems that overall things are tracking as expect to may be a little bit better you mentioned bringing in some of the supply \u2013 limited supply, but if you just look at the math of recent impact this quarter and then roughly 6% to 7%, I believe Bill you said both in 3Q, 4Q and you shake out sort of best case, may be in that range below as $0.15 and as high as $0.18 or so versus or so versus your prior $0.12 to $0.17 tax. So am I just parsing a little too much or when you look at your overall guidance is there a couple of more pennies impact that\u2019s affecting now from Japan?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, that\u2019s exactly what you should expect in our guidance that we just gave. So while we\u2019ve got some positive things within that guidance that are bringing that number up, we believe that Japan is probably going to end up probably going end up probably in kind of that top-end of the original rates that we gave out there rather than the midpoint of that range. So we do think that despite some of the positive items that we\u2019ve gotten on the Japanese side, I\u2019d say that we expect the overall impact in Japan is slightly worse this year than kind of what maybe you originally expecting.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust Robinson", "Okay, great. And then to shift over to new products, Chris this one is for you, you mentioned Wave One, seems like there is a lot of excitement out there when you launched in the U.S. this quarter, and that was a good problem to have trying to keep up with demand, but can you speak to what you\u2019re seeing from may be the endodontics versus out of GPs on the uptake and then I know you guys have dominant share but are you seeing that Wave One is further in your share gains or is it still too early where you\u2019re only supplying it to current customers as of right now?", "Chris Clark", "Yes, sure. In terms of the endodontics and the GPs we\u2019re seeing currently good reaction from both. So I would characterize their target reactions as being very strong and positive pretty much across the board which is fabulous. In terms of the \u2013 I am sorry the second part of your question?", "Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust Robinson", "Just in terms if you\u2019re seeing the share gain \u2013 if you\u2019re seeing Wave One going on further your current market share right now in endodontics.", "Chris Clark", "I think it\u2019s probably a little bit early to tell. We are getting some competitive conversions, we suggest that impacts we would expect some share gains as a result of that. We\u2019re also obviously seeing some cannibalization as well which is a positive for us in terms of obviously moving from other brands that we sell to this. So I would say that it\u2019s pretty much as expected and we\u2019re very pleased with it.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust Robinson", "Okay. And then Bret, so I guess you give a little bit more color on overall sort of the internal growth rates by within your divisions especially within specialty. Are you going to provide those numbers within implants and in endodontics \u2013 in orthodontics?", "Bret Wise", "We usually don\u2019t get that granular, but I will tell you that this quarter our consumables were the strongest growth that we had, of course because there is no orthodontics in there and minor impact from Japan. Our specialty products were next primarily because the endodontics business is running very well with these new products launches but of course they\u2019ve offset by the decline in orthodontics. And our lab business continued to run slightly negative in the quarter as we continue to expect now. Now we just launched this new product in the last week of June or early July in lab that as I first described and also its important to note that in endodontics we had not launched the new file system that we just discussed until I think it was the last week of June, because we got regulatory approval late in June.", "So those were impacting those rates. Now in net all is as reported not ex-ortho or not ex-Japan.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust Robinson", "Okay, perfect. Thanks very much guys.", "Bret Wise", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.", "Verdell Walker \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. This is Verdell Walker standing in for Rob Jones, I just have a couple of quick questions here. First on just the general environment. In times of the discretionary demand, are you seeing uptick in demand for more discretionary procedures or is this still like predominantly on the basic side. Just trying to get more color on what you\u2019re seeing on the ground both in the U.S. and OUS from a procedural thought?", "Bret Wise", "Okay, I\u2019ll take a stab at that. One thing I\u2019m never beginning here is because what\u2019s going on in the orthodontics business, we don\u2019t have an access or we don\u2019t have a real good regroup [ph] to discretionary procedures, because that\u2019s one of the primary discretionary procedures. Absent that, well I think we continued to see good traffic flow at our customers offices for both general dentistry and for specialty work which would be advanced endodontics which is very strong for us right now because we\u2019ve got four new products launching in the implant sector.", "So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a noticeable change frankly since Q1 in traffic flow or appointment books being slower or weaker at the dentist level.", "Verdell Walker \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. And also just to confirm on the tax going forward, we didn\u2019t expect that to be in the 22% to 23% range for \u2018011 for a couple of years going forward, right, just to make sure I have that correct?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, I think if you are excluding the Astra Tech transaction the combination of that, so as our business kind of stands at this point you should expect that our current outlook on the taxes kind of in the 22% to 23% range. I would say also that as it relates to Astra Tech, that we have now done the Astra Tech conference call that we had earlier, we stated that the cash rate would be slightly negatively impacted from that because they do have a slightly higher tax rate that us but I\u2019d probably say somewhere in the may be point to two points higher than the 22% to 23% range but I just gave you one, the Astra Tech is going to (inaudible).", "Verdell Walker \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Bret Wise", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to John Kreger with William Blair.", "Ravi Fadah [ph] \u2013 William Blair", "Hi good morning guys, this is Ravi Fadah in for John Kreger today. If I could just ask a kind of a similar question to what was just asked about utilization, some other health care services companies have started to talk about reduced utilization in the hospital and not sufficient office markets recently. And actually earlier this week, we heard some similar comments from a dental practice owner as well. So from your perspective just to confirm things like utilization trends are in line with the first quarter, you did not see any deterioration?", "Chris Clark", "No, we didn\u2019t see a notable change. I think dentistry probably, I think more stable than some of those other areas of healthcare you see in the hospital and so forth. And we\u2019ve actually seen people continue to see the dentist do some of the preventive work with the appointment books where we saw them before. Although we\u2019re \u2013 as you were appreciating we\u2019re using kind of a sampling technique here as you would as well. So from our viewpoint, we don\u2019t see those will change from the first quarter compared to these table are slightly improving.", "Ravi Fadah \u2013 William Blair", "Great. And then one another question on Japan, so you talked I think about 2012, you mentioned that you think earlier in the year you might get back to a more normal level of inventory? Do you expect to step down from Q4 to Q1 so from $0.06 to $0.07 in the fourth quarter, do you expect it to go to $0.03 in the first quarter to $0.00. How do we think about that?", "Bret Wise", "So I think as I mentioned as you kind of move through this year, the negative impacts of $0.06 to $0.07 are really hitting kind of what we believe is kind of the worst level position in our orthodontic business, that\u2019s when we\u2019re fully out of product. We aren\u2019t really building up the supply yet. As we move into the first quarter on a year-over-year comparison perspective, it will probably still be negative obviously than it was in the first quarter of 2011 because again the first quarter of 2011 really didn\u2019t experienced any of that impact. I think as you should move through the year, we would expect obviously the back half of next year to be much better in the orthodontic area than it was in the back half or expected to be in the back half of this year.", "And so as you moved kind of between the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year, we would expect that impact \u2013 our negative impact on the ortho side is probably going to be a little bit less sequentially, but it will be actually worse year-over-year.", "Ravi Fadah \u2013 William Blair", "Got it. And then one last question on acquisition, Bret you mentioned the acquisition of the laser company is probably a little bit more hi-tech than you\u2019re probably used to. Does that suggest that future acquisitions could be more focused on the equipment side rather than consumables or am I reading too much into that?", "Bret Wise", "I think you are reading a little bit too much into it. This is a small company that\u2019s one of the leaders in let\u2019s call it the smaller desktop lasers that are used to many obituaries for convenience. It fits very well with some of the other parts from our portfolio where we have small equipments and so forth. And in particular in this case, its assigned to a category that\u2019s used in dental surgery which we thought was important. So I wouldn\u2019t think this is really small equipment or large equipment, I wouldn\u2019t take this translated into a strategic structure.", "Ravi Fadah \u2013 William Blair", "Got it. Great, thanks very much.", "Bret Wise", "Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go next to Scott Green of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Hi, thanks for the questions. So in this quarter internal growth was around 3.4% ex-Japan versus in the first quarter I think you said low 4% ex-Japan. And so does kind of Europe shifts may be around Easter and IDS pull through, is that what accounts for the Delta in your view and so neutralizing for that it\u2019s kind of stable sequentially, is that how you will describe it?", "Bret Wise", "I think it\u2019s pretty way to summarize it. Yes, we saw the European markets much slower year-over-year in April and then return to more rates. And we think that\u2019s \u2013 you take Europe is our largest region and that shifted from 4% to 2% and I think that\u2019s why you see this sequential overall internal growth rate ex-Japan or the moderating this from that.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then may be another way to ask about momentum in the business last quarter you highlighted that you were starting to see some favorable mix within the categories to more premium products. Did that continue in the second quarter?", "Bret Wise", "That\u2019s one think it was a little bit hard to detect the cost, a 100,000 SKUs but I would generally yes, it did in that the new products we are bringing out are getting a very warm reception and those are typically the most advanced technologies and highest prices. So I\u2019ve had an indicator of that mix shift, that would be it. And of course we see actually a very warm reception for the new products we\u2019ve been bringing to market even though at a premium price.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So do you sense that there are more kind of gains to be hand in the market just on kind of normalized on \u2013 kind of normalizing utilization or from here can get more towards the 4% to 5% historical average global market growth. Do you need to see more substantial job gains and more substantial economic improvement?", "Bret Wise", "Well I think we\u2019re kind working with the low-end of that range now, even though we don\u2019t have any job or substantial improvement. I think we are thinking about this is that there is some very bad unemployment information based into base line now. I don\u2019t think there is a point we get worse and thus we think that as we see some slow improvement in the economies that that will all be upside and probably push the growth rate back into that normalized range 4% to 6% for the market.", "We\u2019re not far off that, now though I think I would reemphasize, I mean now that the bad news is in the baseline we\u2019re kind of getting close to the normal growth rate and a pickup in employment of course would be upside from here.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then I guess my question on Japan, the way you described it is your expressing to see production backup to the normal levels is in the early part of 2012 is what may be preventing a $0.17 snap back next year, the market share, you\u2019ll have to recoup?", "Bret Wise", "Yes, I think that\u2019s fair to say, we\u2019re realistic about this. We are hopefully \u2013 we\u2019re lowering our customers to some of our competitors right now. And we want to call them back in, but it is a competitive marketplace. We are keeping the rest in place. We\u2019re keeping the SG&A in place, put marketing resources in place. So we\u2019re going to be going out in the market and trying to win that customer base back. But as you kind of mentioned it\u2019s not really a rubber band or something that has to happen over time.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, all right. And any updated view on how much of that market share you\u2019ll be able to get back over the course of 2012?", "Bret Wise", "No, we haven\u2019t speculated on that at this point.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And may be one last year, last quarter you had spoken about implant symposium, that you were hosting in June in the U.S. And I was curious how that went versus your expectations?", "Chris Clark", "Yes, Scott, its Chris, I think that went \u2013 we were very, very pleased with the growth with the reactions and certainly the participation and engagement. It was fabulous event. I think it gave us an opportunity certainly to emphasize some of the advancements in the clinical techniques that we have as well as the product line. Certainly it just happened to come right after the announcement of the Astra Tech acquisition. So certainly that was a nice for folks as well. So I think we were very, very pleased with the reaction.", "Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Bret Wise", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Larry Marsh with Barclays Capital.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks and good morning everyone. Just a couple of clarifications if I could, one would be just components of guidance just to make sure, I am understanding magnitude correctly. So if you want to think about this year, the 4% to 5% midpoint uptick seems to be dominated by tax rate, may be you will get a little bit benefit from FX offset as you said by may be $0.03 or $0.04 incremental impact in Japan, given that higher end of your range. Is that the right magnitude?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, I think that (inaudible) keep in mind that on the tax side because we\u2019re really booking the half way years and benefit running through the second quarter that the benefit that we\u2019re seeking up on tax is about a split that that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re expecting on a normalized basis of each of that remaining quarters. On the FX side, this is probably the second quarter as I mentioned really earlier you know as we got through the first quarter, that we expect at least a current exchange rates that the second quarter is going to be probably the highest benefited quarter for the year associated with FX although we still believe at current FX rates that we\u2019ll probably be north of 5% but lower than the kind of the top line impact that we\u2019re getting this quarter on FX. And I think that that\u2019s reasonable for both the third and fourth quarter at this point.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Bill, in your prepared remarks did you give you \u2013 could you give \u2013 can you quantify the specific top line benefits from currency?", "Bill Jellison", "Well the top line benefit it was 7.8% for this quarter and then in next couple of quarters it\u2019s just little of north somewhere between 5% and that point I think is (inaudible) change.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And just \u2013 but as you had said, I think an important message is tax rate is going to be structurally lower going forward before you add on Astra Tech, so on an annualized basis, why shouldn\u2019t we think this sort of new thought of tax rate, all of the things equal gives, you $0.07, $0.08, $0.09 annually as a base even on a go forward basis, versus my prior expectation which was closer to 25.5% tax rate?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, I think on the $0.07 yes, exactly you talked about based on the rates that we just discussed. I think that that\u2019s a reasonable expectation. Keep in mind that probably a good quarter that benefit may be a little bit more is really associated with the negative impact that we\u2019re getting right now from having that U.S. and geographic mix associated with the ortho. However if that tax rate does go up a little bit because FX hopefully that means that our orthodontic business is snapping back a little bit quicker and then if that\u2019s the case, then hopefully you\u2019ll also get the benefit of the improved performance there. But I think that\u2019s a fair assessment. If you\u2019re thinking kind of may be in kind of in the nickel of share kind of range excluding kind of the negative mix impacts from the tax. We expect the tax should be a realistic position moving forward.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, great. Can I just have two other quick things? I wanted to make sure I understood correctly is your message, Bret really that you feel, what perhaps as confident or not more confident that you\u2019re going to be able solve for this supply chain issue in Japan and now it\u2019s just a matter of getting those customers back that as you said, you\u2019ve learned to competitors. So it sounds like you\u2019re maybe more confident that you have got the fix in place for next year, or is that being too aggressive in terminology?", "Bret Wise", "No, I think since we last spoke in one half we\u2019re now more than 90 days out from the disaster. Well we\u2019re almost a 120 days now from the disaster. And when we\u2019re last operating we\u2019re like 30 days out. So the encouraging signs are, one, we are getting a triple supply and that happened \u2013 that\u2019s happened pretty quickly. And they had removed their equipment, install it, validate it, get approval and now they\u2019ve started shipping in, they\u2019ve had to train employees. I would note that doesn\u2019t mean they can get back to full capacity rapidly, I think that\u2019s certainly a process but the trickle of supply that we have now received came quicker than we thought it would.", "So it also looks like it\u2019s a matter of time now, right, the improvement in the business product of the equipment and the new facility and to rebuilding the capacity, that\u2019s much more favorable than it was 90 days ago when we weren\u2019t certain to how or when it could get any capacity back on line. So now they have some and I think that, it\u2019s a matter of times till we get back to full production again.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, that\u2019s yes, good news. And one other thing, then just to make sure I understand Bret, obviously you have been in the business for long time and your message I actually you can tell there really is a stable to somewhat improving environment, you\u2019ve already built in sort of the base case of fairly high unemployment in your numbers anyway, what do you think would cause you to have to kind of revise your thinking, especially you say the U.S. as you look at into next year that would \u2013 that is not in your thinking today?", "Bret Wise", "Larry, I am not going to speculate about what changes might happen in the future, broad economic issues are hard to predict, at least they are hard to predict for me. So I think that we\u2019ll give you an update on 2012 and so forth as we get to the end of the year. But at this point as far as we can tell the dental markets are stable and reacting about as we expect them to.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Right again, so you imagine even with the news of late the feedback you are getting is that it\u2019s stable and performing as expected. So that\u2019s the message there. Then final question and this may be more Astra Tech related, I know this the second call but just remind us again, assuming it closes this year or early next year your ability to deploy capital to do things like selectively buyback stock and look for tuck-in acquisitions. Is that going to be altered or temporarily held at bay as you integrate or remind us again of the capital allocation post close [ph]?", "Bret Wise", "Well transaction would still have substantial liquidity. We\u2019re establishing our bank arrangements and the bond transactions for this transaction that we will maintain a very, very strong liquidity position in the balance which will allow us to do things selectively. I think the message this morning though was that probably as you expected as the debt reduction would be much higher priority for us especially in the medium and near term after we close the transaction.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, pretty good. Thank you.", "Bret Wise", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. Bill, do you have any greater visibility on the financing calls for the Astra Tech deal at this point, and when do you expect to finalize the financing for that transaction, will you pre-fund that deal in the third quarter by chance?", "Bill Jellison", "Sure, right now we actually literally just took down our revolving our credit agreement so we replaced the one that we had out there which was $200 million facility. We upsized that facility to about $500 million. We\u2019re also going to add an additional piece of that revolver at the point in time that we close which is another $250 million piece which lasts for about a year. On top of that we\u2019ve got in the neighborhood of around $1 billion of additional financing made up of a series of 10 year bonds, some two to three years bonds at least expected right now. But we\u2019re looking at a number of different things at this stage. But our expectation is that we will have that finding and thing in place yet this third quarter on whether the transaction is closed or not.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay, and do you have an update on the revenue contribution from acquisitions for the year?", "Bill Jellison", "This is excluding Astra Tech?", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies", "Yes, excluding the Astra Tech, I guess for the 3 deals you\u2019ve done so far.", "Bill Jellison", "Yes, it\u2019s going to run kind of somewhere between half a point and a point probably for the rest of this year.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies", "And any chance you could break out the mix of price versus volume in the period?", "Bill Jellison", "Breakdown the mix of price and volume is that what you\u2019re saying? As we\u2019ve mentioned and probably running this year somewhere in the 1.5% to 2% range. And I think that\u2019s a fair assessment across the board. Some line some divisions are obviously higher than and other ones are closer to even flatter to up slightly. But I think that that\u2019s a good strong range and I\u2019d say that that range is what I was probably may be a little bit better than probably what we\u2019re seeing in the last couple of years.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Block with SunTrust Robinson.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust Robinson", "Hi, guys just one quick follow-up. On MTM, congrats, it looks like you did get approval over in Canada, and I\u2019m just not that familiar with your plans on how to rollout. It looks like on Wave One you\u2019re willing to do a European launch and then a U.S. launch on a later date. For MTM is that something that you would pursue in Canada, and then rollout in the other territories as the regulatory approvals come in, or do you hold off until you get at least Europe as well?", "Bret Wise", "John, we\u2019ll go ahead and watch in Canada, we got an approval there and then as we get approval elsewhere we\u2019ll go ahead and roll it out as well.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust Robinson", "I appreciate it. Thanks.", "Bret Wise", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our question and answer session for today. At this time I will turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.", "Derek Leckow", "Well, thank you, everyone. That concludes our conference call today.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President, Investor Relations.  Please go ahead, sir.", "Derek Leckow", "Thanks very much, Audra, and my thanks to each of you for joining us today to discuss Dentsply International\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2011 Results.  Joining us on the call today are Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, President and COO; and Bill Jellison, Senior Vice President and CFO.  Each of us will have some prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll be glad to answer any questions that you may have.", "I hope you all had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning.  A copy of the press release is also available for downloading on our website, www.dentsply.com.  We have also provided a set of supplemental slides that is available for download as well.", "Before we get started, it\u2019s important to note that this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties.  These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.  A recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.", "As you can see in the release, our results this quarter include a number of non-recurring items and other non-GAAP adjustments.  In an effort to provide clarity from the distortion of some of these items, our comments on this call will focus on results including certain adjustments which are noted on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the release.  You\u2019ll note that our earnings guidance is also on an adjusted basis.", "With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Bret Wise.  Bret?", "Bret Wise", "Thank you, Derek, and good morning everyone.  Thank you for joining us here on our year-end call.  We\u2019re very pleased this morning to report record sales and adjusted earnings for 2011.  I think as we look back on 2011, there were four major themes for us.  When we entered the year, 2011 was very much a story about new product introductions and innovation, and on that level we performed very well \u2013 in fact above our expectations, particularly in endodontics, preventatives and restoratives.  ", "On March 11, of course, we were faced with another situation with the crisis in Japan and a loss of supply to about 9% of our business.  We\u2019ve managed through that this year, facing the supply shortage essentially throughout the year, and we\u2019re hoping to get back to full supply by midyear this year.", "The third item, of course, was the opportunity to acquire Astra Tech, which we viewed as a significant opportunity to grow our business.  Astra Tech added over $150 million in sales for the quarter and over $200 million in sales for the four months under our ownership.  We\u2019re very pleased with the performance of both the implant and the healthcare businesses for this early period of our ownership and have great expectations for this transaction.", "The fourth theme, of course, was economic activity where we saw a gradual strengthening in the U.S. economy and frankly the U.S. dental market throughout the year, and we saw a sequential weakening of the European economy throughout the year which culminated in a contraction for that economy in the fourth quarter.", "With this backdrop, we\u2019re very pleased to report that sales for the full year were 2.54 billion.  That\u2019s an increase of 14.3% for the full year, including precious metals, and 14.8% excluding precious metal content.  ", "From a market perspective overall, we\u2019re very encouraged by the progression of the dental market in the fourth quarter and our own sales growth.  In total for the quarter, sales grew 29.9% with metal and 30.0% excluding precious metal content.  The growth number ex-PM breaks down with internal growth in total declining 1.2%, acquisitions added 30.4%, and translation was a positive 0.8%.  Internal growth, excluding orthodontics in Japan, was a positive 3.9%.  That\u2019s consistent with the trend that we saw all year.  In fact, our internal growth for the full year, excluding orthodontics in Japan, was also 3.9%.", "Geographic internal growth \u2013 and I\u2019ll give this first to you in total with orthodontics in Japan, and then subsequently without those two factors.  So first in total, growth ex-PM was a positive 0.7 in the U.S. \u2013 this is internal growth \u2013 0.7 in the U.S.  It was negative 1.9% for Europe and it was negative 2.2% for the rest of the world.  Of course, orthodontics in Japan are significantly influencing these results, so without orthodontics in Japan, internal growth ex-PM was a positive 7.6% in the U.S., which is a material improvement compared to really any measure that we\u2019ve seen in the last five years.  Internal growth in Europe ex-ortho was a positive 2.8%.  That\u2019s not bad considering the environment in Europe.  Rest of the world was a positive 1.0%.", "On geographic growth, in the U.S. we saw really strong growth across all of our business units, essentially all the business units except of course orthodontics, improving sequentially and year-over-year.  Although these results are strong and our data suggests that the retail sales of our products were at least in line with this growth, and perhaps were stronger because we think we probably reduced dealer inventories modestly during the quarter.  Our new products continue to gain traction and are driving growth well above market in the United States now, and we expect that to continue as we move into 2012.", "Europe\u2019s internal growth, again, was 2.8% excluding orthodontics, and that was driven by new product introductions, and we\u2019re also very pleased with this performance although I\u2019d say we continue to be concerned about the market in Europe and the economic and the political uncertainty in that region.  All that said, our results continue to be positive, driven again by new product innovations and growth well above the market in Europe.", "Rest of the world, we had a mixed bag with very strong growth in many of the developing regions; however, that was offset by two regions where we reduced promotional activities, increased prices and reduced dealer inventories.  On a consumption basis or a retail basis, we\u2019re probably mid-single digit growth in the rest of the world in total, with emerging market growth high single digits and the developed markets lower.  I think from your perspective, I\u2019d probably take our rest of world results for the last two quarters and average them and think that\u2019s a more reflective number for us.", "Just to frame up the year, growth for the full 12 months ex-PM was a positive internal growth of 0.4.  Acquisition growth was 10.8 and translation was positive 3.6.  For the full year, internal growth ex-ortho in Japan again was positive 3.9, and we think that\u2019s well above what the global dental consumable market is growing.", "Overall I think our results reflect a global dental market that continues to expand but is driven today by the U.S. and emerging markets, whereas a year ago it was Europe and the emerging markets.  By category \u2013 again, this is ex-ortho in Japan \u2013 both consumables and our specialties were up mid-single digits while lab was just barely negative \u2013 I\u2019d say a red zero.  Lab without the contraction in the metal market was positive.  That\u2019s the second quarter in a row for that, and it was much stronger this quarter than last, so sequential improvement there.", "One other data point here is dental implants.  Our total portfolio of dental implants \u2013 this includes Astra Tech on an organic basis \u2013 had pro forma organic growth in the mid-single digits.  It was stronger in the U.S., as you might expect, and weaker in Europe.  Of course, the Astra Tech growth is reported as acquisition rather than internal growth.  Also, our healthcare business grew organically mid-single digits, but again this is included in the acquisition growth rather than internal growth.", "On earnings, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts here this quarter so Bill is going to provide more details.  Overall, EPS non-GAAP came in at $0.51 for the quarter and $2.03 for the year.  For the quarter, orthodontics continued to be a drag on earnings in the $0.05 to $0.06 per share range, and that\u2019s generally in line with our expectations we had coming into the quarter.  For modeling purposes, this will continue to be a negative year-over-year basis for the next two quarters, more so in the first quarter than in the second, but should turn positive in the back half of 2012; and for the full year, we think it will be neutral to slightly positive on our earnings on a year-over-year comparison.", "Our supplier continues to gradually improve production levels, although a bit slower than we had anticipated when we gave our last update.  We\u2019re pleased to see the sequential improvement in supply levels, but we\u2019re still far below the pre-crisis capacities of production.  Lastly, we\u2019re getting more visibility into the capacity schedule now and feel that we\u2019ll be able to do the full re-launch of this product line midyear.  ", "Currency was an increasing headwind sequentially during the quarter, with the euro in particular weakening significantly \u2013 it was down about 5% sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.  Although still slightly positive, currency in total was slightly for our top line in Q4; it was slightly negative on the bottom line, and Bill will provide more discussion of the currency impacts in his comments.", "So let\u2019s move on now to 2012.  Overall for the year, we\u2019re anticipating a continued gradual recovery in the U.S. market.  For Europe, we\u2019re modeling a market that can stay slightly positive despite the negative economic headwinds faced in the region.  Based on these assumptions and continued strong performance of our new product portfolio, we\u2019re estimating that non-GAAP EPS will grow to the range of $2.22 to $2.30 for full-year 2012.  This of course reflects continued integration of Astra Tech, a slight year-over-year earnings improvement in orthodontics, organic growth in our other legacy Dentsply businesses, and some headwind from currency.", "As far as Astra Tech, we expect some continued integration charges in the first quarter and maybe the second, but going forward the earnings statement is going to be much cleaner and easier to follow than it was here in the fourth quarter.", "As far as quarterly progression on earnings, it\u2019s important to remember that the orthodontics headwind will be the strongest in the first half \u2013 in fact, strongest in the first quarter, and currency is also a headwind for the first half of the year at current exchange rates. ", "So in closing my remarks, overall 2011 was a busy year for us with many challenges but also several important opportunities.  Overall we\u2019re pleased with the results and we look forward to continued growth in 2012.", "I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Chris Clark who\u2019s going to discuss our new product performance and a brief update on the Astra Tech integration.  Chris?", "Christopher Clark", "Thank you, Bret, and good morning everyone.  I\u2019m going to take a few moments and provide some deeper insights into the impact of our innovation efforts this past year, and also an update on our integration efforts relative to Astra Tech.  As we\u2019ve mentioned on previous calls, innovation has been a key driver of our results in 2011, and it remains a critical growth strategy for us.  I\u2019d like to briefly highlight some of the most impactful new products that helped drive our growth this past year and provide a few insights into our strong continuing innovation pipeline moving forward.", "On the material side consumables area, we had several new products in 2011 that gained solid market share and should continue to drive growth in 2012 and beyond.  As you may recall, early in the year we introduced ChemFil Rock Advanced Glass Ionomer Restorative in both the U.S. and in Europe with its superior mechanical properties and simplified placement process.  This was our first entry into an estimated $100 million global category and it has already reached a number 4 market position in the U.S., and we are approaching double-digit market share in Germany.  We continue to see strong sequential growth and we expect that to continue in 2012.", "Mid-year, we introduced the Palodent Plus Matrix System to the U.S. market, and in the first six months we already represent about a quarter of the U.S. market.  This product is now being expanded to European markets utilizing the same launch plan that has been so successful in the U.S.  Later in the year, we launched the RDH Freedom handpiece, which is a lightweight cordless prophy handpiece that delivers clear ergonomic benefits for the hygienist.  In the first two months since introduction, sales have far exceeded our expectations and it\u2019s clear that this will be a key growth engine for our preventive business in 2012.", "Before leaving the consumables area, I\u2019d like to briefly mention SureFil SDR flowable composite.  While this product was introduced in late 2009, I think it\u2019s a really good example of how we use additional marketing, key opinion leader support, clinical studies and product add-ons to help our innovation efforts drive significant growth for several years after introduction.  With respect to SureFil SDR Flow, these efforts enabled us to achieve a 38% growth in the U.S. last year off of an already very strong sales base.", "Perhaps our strongest innovation impact in 2011, however, was in the endodontics franchise.  The introduction of the Wave One and Reciproc reciprocating platforms was likely our largest and most impactful new product introduction in years.  These products have received numerous innovation awards around the globe and have clearly driven strong incremental market share gains in the endodontics area.  We\u2019re very pleased with the rates that we\u2019re seeing in trial, repurchase, and cannibalization, and we estimate that we\u2019ve trained over 35,000 dentists on the system thus far.", "We\u2019re also very pleased with the market acceptance of the Guttacore obturation system and the early success of the QMix 2in1 irrigating solution.  Together with the reciprocating platform, these products are defining the next generation of endodontic therapy.  ", "Perhaps most importantly, we\u2019re continuing to leverage the innovation pipeline as we enter 2012.  This year, we\u2019ve already launched several new products including Volo Disinfectant Wipes from Sultan, which provides us an entry into a $40 million category that we\u2019ve not previously competed in.  We\u2019ve also launched the Vortex Blue nickel titanium endodontic file in the U.S.  This file provides greater resistance to cyclical fatigue, increased torque strength, and reduced shape memory.  Next week, we will be launching the Cavitron Evolution ultrasonic scaling system.  This system includes a patented touch-and-go foot pedal that provides much broader freedom of movement for the hygienist during the scaling procedure.  We will be featuring these products, as well as several other innovations, at next week\u2019s Chicago Mid-Winter Dental Show.", "I\u2019d now like to provide some brief comments on the Astra Tech integration efforts, and I would characterize the integration as moving forward very much as expected.  Our integration strategy includes the creation of a new combined global implant business named Dentsply Implants that combines the strengths of the Friadent and Astra Tech organizations.  This new entity will focus on growing all of the combined brands of the Friadent and Astra Tech portfolios, including XiVE, Ankylos, OsseoSpeed, Atlantis, and Isis.  We\u2019re tremendously excited about the combination of these brands and the organizations and the critical mass that this provides us in the implant market.", "Our second core integration strategy is to create a dedicated healthcare business that provides a specific focus on the growth opportunities in that platform.  We continue to be very impressed with the market position Astra Tech created with the LoFric platform and believe the business will further benefit from the additional attention and focus that a separate healthcare organization will provide.  ", "Finally, we\u2019ve announced the top level leadership of these organizations, both of which will be under the executive responsibility of Jim Mosch, Executive Vice President.  The leadership team is a true blending of the top talent from both the Dentsply and Astra Tech organizations and will provide strong organizational foundations for these businesses.  Beyond the top level of management, we have a number of integration teams that are focused on specific functional or geographic opportunities.  We remain very pleased with the level of collaboration and cooperation within these teams and with the progress they\u2019re making.  I look forward to providing additional updates on our integration efforts on future quarterly calls.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison who will cover the financial results for the quarter and for the year in greater detail.  Bill?", "", "William Jellison", "Good morning everyone.  Bret already discussed our sales growth within the quarter and the year, but I\u2019d like to add a couple of additional comments regarding our sales.  The 2011 geographic mix of sales without precious metal content was as follows:  the U.S. represents 34% of sales, Europe was 43% this year, and the rest of the world was 23%.  Our sales mix will shift a few points more once Astra Tech is included for the entire 12-month period as its sales are more heavily weighted in Europe.", "Despite the recent strengthening of the dollar within the quarter, we will still benefit from a slightly weaker dollar year-over-year, which benefited our top line growth by about 0.8% in the quarter and 3.6% on a full-year basis.  FX had a slight negative impact on earnings per share compared to last year in the quarter, a negative impact sequentially versus the third quarter, and we were favorably impacted overall for the year.  We expect a headwind from current foreign exchange rates on both the top line and the bottom line, with the largest impact in the first half of the year.  For the full year at today\u2019s exchange rate, the top line would be impacted by as much as 3 to 4 percentage points negatively.", "As Derek mentioned and as you can see in our earnings release, the fourth quarter as well as the full year included a number of items which impacted our results, which we have indentified as non-recurring adjustments.  Most of the following comments exclude the impact of those items.  Gross profit margins on an adjusted basis as a percentage of sales ex-precious metal content in the fourth quarter of 2011 were 56.5% compared to 55.6% for the fourth quarter of 2010.  When compared to the same period of last year, this rate was positively impacted by favorable product mix and price increases.  Our produce mix was benefited by the strong gross margin rates of our recent acquisitions and from strong sales of endodontic and general consumable products.  These positive impacts were partially offset by the effects of negative exchange rate impacts, mostly caused by some key products that are purchased or produced in Switzerland and Japan.  This impact is more easily understood when you look at the 18 to 20% strengthening of the Swiss franc to the dollar earlier in the year, and even the roughly 10% strengthening of the Swiss franc to the euro in mid-2011.", "The impact of these higher exchange rates was in our inventory coming into the quarter and came through the income statement in the fourth quarter, despite the weakening of these currencies during the quarter.  In the aggregate, currency rates hurt non-GAAP EPS by about a couple of cents in the period.  Our recent acquisitions are expected to have a positive mix impact on gross profit margin rates over each of the next three quarters as they are fully reflected in the Company\u2019s results.  ", "SG&A included approximately $18 million of acquisition and integration expenses and other adjustments.  Absent these costs, SG&A on an adjusted basis would have been $274 million or 40.5% excluding precious metals in the fourth quarter of 2011, versus 35.6% in the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter.  As we mentioned on our third quarter call, our SG&A is expected to run higher for two reasons:  first, our recent acquisitions have much higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales than our base business, and thus we bring those into the mix.  They will increase this ratio but will be mitigated somewhat as we complete integration over the next few years.  Second, although our orthodontic business sales are down substantially due to the supply outage, we are maintaining the infrastructure of this business, anticipating resupply and the re-launch of the product line.  This year-over-year comparison with higher expense level as a percentage of sales will continue through the third quarter of this year, when the acquisition impacts annualize and the orthodontic business supply disruption begin to show year-over-year improvements.", "Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis were 16% in the fourth quarter compared to 20% last year in the same period.  As Bret noted, the Japanese natural disaster negatively impacted our earnings per share by approximately $0.05 to $0.06 in the fourth quarter, mostly from lost sales in our orthodontic business from the lack of consistent product supply.  While the supply situation is gradually improving, we expect this business will have a negative impact on results in the first quarter of 2012 of approximately $0.05, and a more modest but still negative impact in the second quarter measured on a year-over-year basis as the disaster occurred late in the first quarter and had little impact on our business in that period.", "Net interest and other expense in the fourth quarter on a reported basis was $14.6 million compared to $4.8 million last year in the fourth quarter.  This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest expense associated with the acquisition of Astra Tech.  ", "Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter of 19.7% is not really meaningful as there are tax adjustments and non-GAAP impacts reflected in that rate.  On an adjusted basis, our operating tax rate for this quarter was approximately 22% and ended the year slightly below 23%.  The tax rate continues to have a slightly favorable impact compared to last year and is the result of two items:  first, we are benefiting from a more favorable geographic mix as our U.S.-based income has been reduced due to the impacts of a weaker dollar and the negative impacts of our supply outage of orthodontic products.  We expect this impact will gradually go away as our sales and earnings in this business are rebuilt over the next few years.  We are also benefiting from permanently reinvesting international income as we are able to more efficiently utilize those earnings.  We believe that a tax rate of approximately 23% is reasonable when looking at 2012 despite the higher tax rate of the Astra Tech business.", "To better understand and follow some of the following comments, you can look at the tables included in our recent press release which reconciles performance from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to adjusted non-GAAP performance.  Net income attributable to Dentsply International in the fourth quarter of 2011 on a reported basis was $40.6 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared to $67.8 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010.  These results include a number of non-GAAP items mostly associated with recent acquisitions.  ", "On an adjusted basis, earnings excluding restructuring, acquisition-related costs, and other related items and tax adjustments in both periods, which constitute a non-GAAP measure, were $72.6 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $75.2 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Remember, though, that this quarter includes a negative $0.05 to $0.06 per share negative impact from our ortho and Japanese business.", "Net income attributable to Dentsply International in 2011 for the full year was $205 million or $1.70 per diluted share.  Net income for 2010 was $265.7 million or $1.82 per diluted share; and net income for comparability analysis on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the reconciling items in the press release for the years ending 2011 and 2010, were $290.9 million and $283.9 million respectively.   This represents earnings of $2.03 per diluted share for 2011 compared to $1.94 in 2010, which was an increase of 4.6% for the year.  ", "Cash flow from operating activities in 2011 was approximately $393 million compared to $377 million in 2010.  Keep in mind we had a number of payments this year for costs associated with acquisitions, legal settlements and other items of approximately $4 million which negatively impacted operating cash flows for the period.", "Capital expenditures were $71 million in the year with depreciation and amortization of approximately 93 million.  Capital expenditures in 2012 are expected to be approximately 100 to $120 million.  Inventory days were 93 at the end of 2011.  Most of this benefit was from currency compared to 103 days at the end of 2010.  These levels now also reflect the addition of Astra Tech inventory as well.  Accounts receivable days were 52 days including similar days for Astra Tech at the end of 2011 compared to 55 days at the end of 2010.  ", "At the end of 2011, we had $77 million in cash and short-term investments.  Total debt was $1.77 billion at the end of 2011 with net debt at the time of our acquisition of Astra Tech of $1.8 billion, and has been reduced to $1.69 billion by the end of the year.  ", "In 2011, we repurchased approximately $80 million of our stock or approximately 2.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $36 per share, and based on the Company\u2019s authorization to maintain up to 34 million shares of treasury stock, we now have approximately 12 million shares available for repurchase.  However, as we have now completed our acquisition of Astra Tech, our preference will be working to pay some of that debt down before we utilize the remaining authorization, although we will more than likely continue to offset options.", "We expect the reasonably stable global economy in 2012 should allow the dental market to once again show modest growth for the year.  As mentioned before, the acquisition of Astra Tech does increase the volatility that changes in FX rates have on our sales and earnings as more of our sales and production is now located outside of the U.S.  We are most impacted on sales by changes in the euro and our purchases and cost structures are most impacted by the euro, Swiss franc, Swedish kroner, and also the Japanese yen.  We are utilizing additional systematic cash flow hedges on certain transactions to help minimize the volatility that these FX fluctuations may otherwise have on our business.  At current exchange rates, we expect to have a negative impact from foreign exchange rates in 2012 on both our top and our bottom line.", "Finally as Bret stated, despite the softness and uncertainty that still plague the broader global economy, we are establishing our 2012 diluted earnings per share guidance at $2.22 to $2.30 per share on an adjusted basis.", "That concludes our prepared remarks.  Thanks for your support, and we\u2019d be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question and Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you.  To ask a question today, please press star, one on your telephone keypad.  If you\u2019re using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment.  Again if you do have a question, please press star, one.", "We\u2019ll go first to Jeff Johnson at Robert Baird.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thank you.  Good morning guys.  Bret, I was hoping I could start with you, just on the U.S. organic growth number.  Obviously a strong number there at 7.6%.  As I look at how the year progressed, you kind of started in line to slightly below market early in the year; obviously in the second half, you\u2019ve been 100, maybe 300 basis points above market.  How do you feel like 2012 is going to play out?  If the market does X, would you expect Dentsply to be X-plus-100 to 200 basis, kind of where you\u2019ve been the second half of 2011?", "", "Bret Wise", "Well I think, Jeff, our performance in the U.S. market this year was really stellar, particularly at the end of the year.  You might recall that coming into the year we were talking about new product launches, we had this full pipeline coming.  Those started to launch in the first quarter but some of them didn\u2019t launch until the third or fourth quarter; in fact, the endodontics portfolio that we had one file in the U.S. didn\u2019t launch until late third quarter, and thus that momentum has been building throughout the year.  The benefit of new product launches is really a three, four-year period, and so we\u2019re just now in the first year of what could be a good tailwind for us on the new products.  So we expect that to contribute again to above-market growth in 2012.  I\u2019m a little reluctant to say exactly how much above market because there\u2019s a lot of variables to measure there, but I\u2019d say we\u2019re highly confident and we can grow above the consumable market in 2012 in the U.S.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "All right, that\u2019s helpful.  And then on your orthodontics comments, I\u2019ll have to go back and look at how you phrased it last quarter.  My sense is maybe just a little push-out on the timeline, or maybe not feeling as confident you\u2019ll get the full product pipeline back as soon as maybe you were thinking.  Any comments there?", "Bret Wise", "Yeah, I think that we were a little bit more optimistic coming into the fourth quarter than we are right now.  The progress made during the fourth quarter at the supplier and the ramp-up of the production was not what we had expected.  We\u2019re still expecting full launch by mid-year this year; I think before we were probably saying sometime in the second quarter.  We\u2019re still confident about the recovery plan but the ramp-up wasn\u2019t quite as fast as we thought it would be.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Is there anything you can share that\u2019s maybe creating some headwind there and gives us comfort that this won\u2019t then get pushed third quarter or fourth quarter, something like that?", "Bret Wise", "Well, our supplier is very optimistic and continues to give us capacity schedules which we think would be great if they hit them, but they may be optimistic in some ways.  So I think we\u2019re taking a bit more conservative stance now in their ability to get back to\u2014the timing to get back to a full 5,000 SKU assortment of products.  At this point, we don\u2019t think that it will slip further than we\u2019re giving you guidance on now.  We think this is a mid-year full re-launch, both in the U.S. and Europe, and we\u2019re just going to have to update you on that as we go through the year.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Fair enough.  Last question for Bill \u2013 I\u2019ll jump after that.  Pretty aggressive deleveraging already off the deal at $100 million-plus.  Should we think of that and just kind of double that for 2012?  Is it 200, $300 million deleveraging expected in 2012, or how to think about that, Bill?", "William Jellison", "Yeah, I\u2019d say that that\u2019s a reasonable expectation.  We utilized pretty much all of our free cash flow in deleveraging that, so you know how much operating cash flow that we generate.  We\u2019re expecting to probably generate similar levels, obviously, again in 2012, so unless we\u2019re putting any money back into some additional small or mid-sized acquisitions, you should expect us to be paying down at that kind of level.  ", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "And it\u2019s the lower interest rate debt that gets paid off first, right \u2013 that 1, 2% debt, if I remember right?", "William Jellison", "Yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "All right.  Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Larry Marsh at Barclays Capital.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks and good morning.  Just a couple of things, if I could \u2013 first, as Chris talked a little about the introduction of products and sort of how it was disproportionately beneficial in the fourth quarter, but as you said, your fourth quarter internal growth U.S. is best since\u2014looks like as we look at it since mid-\u201905.  So as we think about this year for the U.S., does that mean the comps for the first half of the year should be particularly good and then slow down a little bit as you get toward the end of 2012, or as you look at it with product introductions, your confidence level with U.S. growth being certainly above market, better than it would have been three to four months ago?", "Bret Wise", "I think our confidence is better than it was three to four months ago, and Chris may have something to add to this; but the uptake on these new products has been really encouraging.  It\u2019s true we\u2019re going to have easier comps early in the year in the U.S. than we\u2019ll have in the fourth quarter \u2013 7.6 is a pretty high number to overcome.  But I think for the full-year, when we look at longer periods of time for full-year, we feel really good about our prospects in this market and the benefit we have from this new innovation.  ", "Christopher Clark", "Yeah, the only thing I\u2019d add, Larry, is I feel like we\u2019ve got a pretty solid head of momentum at this point on some of those new products, and I would expect that to continue obviously early in the year, and we\u2019ll just keep driving it and keep it going.", "Bret Wise", "Yeah.  The other thing I\u2019d add to that is that the pipeline for this year is pretty good as well.  We\u2019re going to have another slew of new products to hit the market this year and we should get the uptake from those, as well as the carry-over uptake from the ones we launched this year.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Right, okay.  So look for continued information there.  And then just elaborate a little bit about\u2014so Europe, as you said, more challenging.  No new news there.  Rest of world \u2013 mixed.  So maybe if you\u2019d elaborate a little bit \u2013 you said two particular regions where there was pullback on inventory, increased pricing, and some impact on sales.  Can you remind us of what those were?", "Bret Wise", "Yeah, I don\u2019t want to give you the regions from a competitive standpoint, but in two of the larger regions in what we call rest of world, we increased prices coming into this quarter, we reduced promotional activity, and we did that because we saw dealer inventories getting too high.  We wanted to get them a little bit lower and leaner, and we wanted to improve our margins; so we reduced the promotional activity and that had the expected impact of restraining growth just for this one quarter.  It should bounce back next quarter.", "But overall in the rest of world region, particularly in the emerging markets or developing markets, our performance continues to be very strong and that will continue to be a growth driver for us next year.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Second thing, just a little bit of elaboration on the communication around Astra Tech.  You mentioned now sort of an integrated team in place with the brands staying the same in some of the implants, dedicated healthcare platform, and top-level leadership.  Can you reflect on\u2014I know some of the conversation before had been about the investments that Astra Tech had made that you\u2019re going to be able to leverage with your focus on costs and consolidation and coordination with your other brands, and I think a lot of confidence in the management team of the healthcare platform you acquired.  So just looking at 2012 as you see what you\u2019ve done already with Astra Tech, do you feel like your\u2014it sounds like the message is you\u2019re right on plan with every component of what you hope to achieve, and is it fair to say that your view of overall dental implant market growth is no different or no worse than it was when you acquired the asset?", "Bret Wise", "A couple of things there \u2013 first of all, with respect to our ability to increase operating margins of the combined business, I think that\u2019s clearly on track, although the first three months there\u2019s a little bit of chaos so we\u2019re working through how best to create the value as one organization on the dental implant side, and I think we\u2019re making good progress there under Jim\u2019s leadership.", "With respect to healthcare, we\u2019re very pleased with their performance with the quality of the people running that business and with their capabilities, we think, to grow that business going forward.  ", "With respect to the dental implant market, now we\u2019re the fourth major player to report. I think we\u2019ve seen a range of results, organic growth range of results of slightly negative to maybe positive 2%.  We\u2019re positive mid-single digits; there\u2019s another large player to report yet, but I think with all those data points put together, you have to believe that the market must be growing single digits, or in the fourth quarter was growing low single digits.  ", "In our acquisition model, we expected kind of low to mid-single digits for 2011 and probably a good part of 2012, but we were expecting that market to pick up later in 2012.  That\u2019s yet to be seen.  We\u2019re hopeful that will happen.  But in the U.S., the market is extraordinarily strong and underpenetrated, so I would say the U.S. market is now growing close to double digits and we expect that to continue as we see employment improve and this economy tick up.  Europe is going to be a little bit tougher this year, for obvious reasons, but we\u2019ll just have to see how that develops as we go.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay.  And fair to say when you first announced the acquisition, you had said $0.12 to $0.17 of accretion on sort of adjusted earnings basis first full year after close.  Is that still an appropriately wide range, or are you able to narrow that or think about that differently now?", "Bret Wise", "Well, we\u2019re not going to give an update on the range of accretion of Astra Tech, although you can see in our earnings guidance there\u2019s a meaningful impact there.  We\u2019re pleased with the outlook of that business from both a sales growth and an earnings perspective, and the ability to continue to innovate and invest in it.  So obviously the 2.22 to 2.30 includes a meaningful component from Astra Tech and we think we\u2019re on target.  ", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Great.  And then just a quick clarification on the tax rate \u2013 it sounds like a little bit of a good guy there.  I was thinking it to be more like 24, 25.  I guess, Bill, you\u2019re saying 23 is your thought, even with Astra Tech; so that\u2019s just good asset management and I think that\u2019s something that you think would be sustainable even after 2012 as you look forward.", "William Jellison", "Yeah, we\u2019ve got a lot of activity going on around that aspect.  Any time you do a major international acquisition as well, too, there\u2019s a lot of restructuring or structuring-related activities that take place, and especially around the tax side.  There are projects that are still in the works associated with that that will come to fruition as we move through this period, but at this point we\u2019re comfortable with the 23% estimation.", "Larry Marsh \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Yeah, okay, I\u2019ll stop there. Thanks.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs.", "", "Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hey, thanks for the questions.  Just sticking with Astra Tech, it looks like it added about 150 million this quarter.  I was curious how that matched up relative to your internal expectations, and then maybe how we should think about that relative to your annual run rate expectations.", "Bret Wise", "Frankly, it\u2019s right on.  What we had said when we announced the deal is we thought we were paying\u2014by the time the deal would close, we\u2019d be paying about three times sales on a trailing basis, which would be $600 million.  They\u2019ve hit those numbers in the period that we\u2019ve owned them.  They\u2019ve met our expectations, and they\u2019re continuing to deliver really pretty strong results.  So I would say it\u2019s right in line with what we expected.", "Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay, great.  And then I think you just commented on this, Bret, but for the implant expectations, the market itself in 2012, could you maybe just share with us what\u2019s the underlying assumption behind the guidance for the implant market globally?", "Bret Wise", "I think the implant market globally will be low single digits to perhaps moving into the mid-single digit range, but probably at the low end of that.  My belief is that it will start out reasonably weak, kind of low single digits.  I mean, we\u2019ll learn a lot more when the last of the five majors report; but later in the year, particularly if Europe works through some of its problems, that could accelerate.", "Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it.  And then just relative to third quarter, did that market stay the same, decelerate, accelerate?", "Bret Wise", "I think the overall market was the same to maybe slightly slower.", "Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got you.  And then just the last one I had on Astra Tech, it sounds like you\u2019re separating out the medical business.  Any update or anything we should read from that on whether or not this is being viewed as a strategic asset for the Company going forward?", "Bret Wise", "It is a strategic asset for the Company.  The reason we\u2019re separating it, obviously, is we have two major dental implant businesses that we need to bring together in integration, and it makes no sense to bring those together in an organization that has the healthcare business also merged into it.  So we\u2019re trying to separate it to give it it\u2019s own life.  We\u2019ve got dedicated management.  We\u2019re making some investments there that we think will help that business grow, and I think you should view that as the same as you view our other 45 businesses.", "Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got you, that makes a lot of sense.  Thanks.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Glen Santangelo at Credit Suisse.", "Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yeah, thanks a lot.  Bill, I just wanted to follow up with you on some of the FX comments you made earlier.  You seemed to suggest that FX cost you about two pennies in the quarter \u2013 was that correct?", "William Jellison", "Yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And so I thought if I heard you correctly, you said that for \u201912 if the currencies kind of stay where they are, it would be about a 3 to 4% top line headline impact, but you didn\u2019t give the bottom line.  Am I correct in assuming it\u2019d be about a 4% impact on the bottom line in fiscal \u201912 as well?", "William Jellison", "Yeah, I think from your perspective on the earnings side of the equation, obviously it makes a big difference on which currencies are stronger or weaker within that average, because they all don\u2019t move in the same direction.  But if you look at what we show on our presentation as well too and the grid there to give you some guidance on how earnings move relative to the sales side, earnings do move at least a little bit more in line with that if currencies are moving in the same direction.  So yeah, you could think that it\u2019s somewhere in that probably 3 to 4% range as well.", "Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks.  And it kind of sounds like\u2014I\u2019m just trying to reconcile all the moving pieces relative to your guidance, because it kind of sounds like obviously you\u2019re going to have an FX headwind in fiscal \u201912, but an obvious benefit from Astra Tech as well as it sounds like the orthodontic business can be a positive contributor year-over-year.  And so if I kind of reconcile all those pieces, it kind of sounds like you\u2019re implying kind of mid to high single-digit organic-y PS growth in fiscal \u201912.  Are there any other big swing factors or moving pieces I should be thinking about?", "William Jellison", "No, I think that that\u2019s reasonable for how you\u2019re thinking about that on that side.  I\u2019d say on the orthodontics piece as well, as Bret mentioned, that first quarter we were originally expecting that we were going to already see some sequential improvement in the first quarter on ortho.  That\u2019s obviously not taken place, so we\u2019re thinking that this year, because the first half is obviously going to be a drag, that it will probably take pretty much through the second half of the year to kind of offset that negative impact that\u2019s occurring in that first half of the year.  So orthodontic for us right now is expected to kind of be flat, maybe a slight positive; but that\u2019s probably a little bit softer than we would have expected before.  But yes, your other components that you were talking about there make sense in relationship to the guidance that we\u2019re putting out there.", "Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And Bret, maybe if I could just ask one follow-up question on the ortho business \u2013 it kind of sounds like you believe that it\u2019s reasonable to think that we\u2019re going to have a full re-launch of the product by the middle of the year to help out the back half of the year.  I guess what my question is, is how confident are you in this recovery plan because presumably these orthodontists are buying their self-ligating brackets somewhere else and so as the supply improves, how confident are you that you\u2019ll be able to win all that market share back beginning in the back half of this year?", "Bret Wise", "Well, I\u2019m not confident we can win all the market share back in the back half of this year.  I think this will be a multi-year recovery plan, but what gives me some confidence is right now we\u2019re trying to sell products that we\u2019re on backorder on, which is not an easy thing to do.  So once we have full supply or a full range of products and we can get that in the hands of our reps, it makes their job a lot easier.  I think that with respect to the recovery plan, some of the market share we\u2019ll get back quickly \u2013 you know, loyal customers that are hanging with us and we\u2019re trying to serve their needs through allocation, et cetera.  Some of it will be a little bit longer term project, and of course once a customer converts, sometimes you don\u2019t get them all back at all.  So I do think this is a multi-year thing, and in our guidance we\u2019re not counting on getting a major part of the market share back in the back half of the year.  We\u2019re counting on having full supply so that we can get the customers that we have now off backorder.", "Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse", "So as I think about into fiscal \u201913, not that you want to talk that far out, but theoretically, presumably it\u2019s going to be an ongoing process of you regaining market share, which could be a benefit to you in fiscal \u201913 versus \u201912 as well.", "Bret Wise", "I think that\u2019s very fair to assume.  That\u2019s a good assumption.", "Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks for the comments.", "Bret Wise", "Okay.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to John Kreger at William Blair.", "Robbie Fatta \u2013 William Blair", "", "Hi, good morning guys.  This is actually Robbie Fatta in for John Kreger today.  Bill, I think I heard you say you were guys were starting to take a look at some small and mid-sized acquisitions recently.  Can you give us any more detail on where those might be focused geographically and functionally?", "William Jellison", "Well, I didn\u2019t really say that we were looking, although we\u2019re always looking.  But I said that on the cash flow side, if we did use any of the cash flow for acquisitions, that may offset any of the pay down, although it\u2019s our expectation in 2012 that we are going to still pay down a significant amount of that debt.  On the acquisition side, though, similar to any time, we\u2019re always looking at different opportunities both in different regions as well as in the primary key product categories that we have out there.  So when and if those come to fruition is up in the air.  You never know when those happen, but you can be assured that we\u2019re still always looking at a number of different opportunities.", "Robbie Fatta \u2013 William Blair", "Got it, thanks.  And is there any update on the potential launch of the MTM product in the United States?", "Christopher Clark", "No, at this point, Robbie, we\u2019re still in the U.S. waiting for FDA approval, and again, that\u2019s hard to predict exactly when that\u2019s going to happen.", "Robbie Fatta \u2013 William Blair", "Got it.  How has the product gained traction outside the U.S. in the geographies you have launched it?", "Christopher Clark", "Yeah, we\u2019re certainly gaining some traction with it.  I would say it\u2019s early in the launch process, if you will, but at this point in time I wouldn\u2019t see anything that I\u2019d be concerned about.", "Robbie Fatta \u2013 William Blair", "Great.  Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Brandon Couillard at Jefferies.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies", "Hi, good morning.  Bret, what\u2019s your sense of the general demand environment, I guess specifically in the U.S.?  Do you still feel like there\u2019s a pent-up demand scenario in the market, and what is your sense of the strength in the U.S.?  Can you quantify maybe how much might be attributable to better utilization trend versus the new product contribution?", "Bret Wise", "Sure, Brandon.  I think a couple things \u2013 when the U.S. hit the skids in late 2008, early 2009, we saw unemployment really skyrocket, and we saw that cause the dental market to kind of go flat to just slightly negative, despite the fact that unemployment went from 5% to 10%, which was a body blow to the economy.  But the dental market still performed pretty well in that environment, and what our thesis has been all along because of how we\u2019ve seen it in past recessions is the dental market will kind of flatten out and start to grow again.  Even though unemployment is still high, it will grow modestly; but once we see employment start to improve meaningfully month after month, the dental market can really accelerate because we\u2019re adding a whole new slew of customers to a low baseline already.  ", "Our theory is that that\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now.  I mean, we saw the results of a major distributor yesterday.  They had very strong consumable growth, near 5%.  You see our number here of 7.6.  I think that\u2019s reflective of higher utilization in general and the market improving in general, particularly in the United States; and then our number at 7.6 I think is also reflective of some very strong uptake on these new products that we\u2019re launching.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies", "Thanks.  And then I believe dental reimbursement in Germany is stepping up somewhere in the 5 to 6% range next year.  How might that impact your demand trends there, if at all?", "Bret Wise", "Well I think in Germany there\u2019s a little bit of confusion about what\u2019s going on there.  I think in the private part of the market, which is maybe 15, 20% of the market, it\u2019s a regulated market, meaning a dentist can only charge so much for a given procedure.  And the change that happened was there was a pretty meaningful increase in that regulated price \u2013 how much a dentist could charge.  It wasn\u2019t necessarily a change in reimbursement; it was just a change in how much they can charge the customer.  I don\u2019t think that that will have a major impact \u2013 some dentists will charge a higher price, some will not.  I think that it\u2019s not really a change in reimbursement, it\u2019s just a change in what the price can be charged.", "The same thing happened in Holland, by the way, and there\u2019s been a little bit of an increase in the government funding to the market in the U.K., which was encouraging.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay, fair enough.  And then last one \u2013 Bill, the cash flow experience seemed pretty strong in the fourth quarter.  I know Astra Tech generally has a lower cash conversion cycle than the legacy X-ray profile.  Should we anticipate continued progress there on the working capital front as you get a full year of Astra contribution, and can you give us a better sense of your operating cash flow expectations for the year?", "William Jellison", "Well I\u2019d say on the working capital side, especially both in 2011 and in 2012, there\u2019s a lot of different activities that are in there because of a number of these non-GAAP adjustments that are impacting it associated with the acquisition and other items that are kind of distorting a little bit, as I mentioned.  I think our cash flow in general at the 393 range in 2011, as I mentioned, includes some of those additional outflows of cash as well, so we would expect that that would be stronger.  As we look at their operations, you heard the inventory numbers and even the receivable numbers that we talked about, and actually Astra Tech\u2019s were pretty much in line with where we\u2019re at.  I think that we\u2019ve got a lot of additional activities and focus areas in this, and I think over the next couple years as we continue to integrate this business, we think that there will be some opportunities on the working capital end as well.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Steve Beuchaw at Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi.  Thanks and good morning.  I wonder if you could give us an update with a bit more granular detail on the end markets in Europe geographically, by product line.  Did you see any of the incremental weakness and more recent rebound in some of the core markets like Germany that others have cited?  Is there any sign of incremental weakness in peripheral Europe?  How might that answer be different, say, in implants relative to consumables?", "Bret Wise", "Well I think generally the market in Europe has weakened.  That\u2019s not necessarily our results, but the market in Europe weakened sequentially in the fourth quarter.  It\u2019s a mixed bag \u2013 southern Europe is very weak, the mature part of Europe is kind of stable or maybe a little bit up or a little bit down, depending on the market.  The CIS region, which we include in Europe, continues to be pretty strong.  So it\u2019s a mixed bag.", "In particular on dental implants, I mean, we\u2019ve seen the results of these three other competitors, which it looks like they were all very negative in Europe.  Our results were still positive in Europe organically, but I think that\u2019s a sign that the dental implant market in Europe, at least, has weakened somewhat sequentially.  I think that\u2019s probably the case.", "Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and then another question on the U.S. market, which I know you\u2019ve touched on but I wanted to get more specific to trends in the fourth quarter.  Can you spend a bit more time there on the detail and the strength sequentially in the end markets \u2013 is that more base consumables or endo, or are you seeing more of an aesthetic rebound, again thinking specifically about the quarter and what you\u2019re seeing here in the early days of \u201912.", "Bret Wise", "Okay, this is going to sound like a gross general statement, but it\u2019s true \u2013 we saw sequential improvement in every platform we have in the U.S. except for orthodontics, which of course is because of those other circumstances.  But it was across the board, and frankly if you go back to our comments in the third quarter, it was across the board then as well.  We\u2019ve had two quarters back-to-back where we\u2019ve seen sequential improvement across essentially all of our platforms in the U.S. in both the third and fourth quarter.", "Steve Beuchaw \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay.  Thanks again, guys, and have a great morning.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Block at SunTrust.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust", "Thanks guys and good morning.  Bill, maybe the first question for you, just more from a modeling perspective.  When we think about OPEX into 2012 based on your comments from Astra Tech and the orthodontics division, should we think about the OPEX leverage starting to come back in the third quarter of \u201912 once you annualize a bit of Astra, or is that still a bit too soon considering that deal closed in September, and think about a little bit of OPEX leverage in 4Q \u201912 and then accelerating into \u201913.", "William Jellison", "Well, I think it\u2019s probably fair to say that from a mix perspective that you\u2019ll probably see similar mix impacts both in gross margin and SG&A in kind of the OPEX area as you saw in the fourth quarter as we move into both the first, second and even third quarters of this year, until we fully anniversary that.  I\u2019d say as you get into the third quarter, you\u2019re going to see some where it\u2019s already been annualized on the Astra Tech, at least in the month of September; and then on the ortho side, again, we were already beginning to feel more of the heavier impacts in the third quarter, so we would expect that the third quarter won\u2019t get worse from that perspective.  It should begin to show improvements on the ortho front.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust", "Okay, great.  And then this builds a little bit on the earlier question in Europe, but there was obviously a ton of headline risk throughout the quarter, yet your results picked up a bit in Europe from 3Q to 4Q when you ex-out the ortho.  So maybe just some commentary \u2013 is that just pulled up a little bit by having a full quarter of Astra in there, and I think you mentioned Astra\u2019s business was in and around mid-single digits.  How are you guys able to sidestep a bit of the weakness in the overall market in Europe 3Q to 4Q?", "Bret Wise", "I think it\u2019s kind of specific for us, but for us it was we\u2019re launching a really powerful portfolio of new products, not just in Europe but globally.  You see the impact of that in the United States numbers as well.  But it\u2019s clear from the analysis that we\u2019ve done that it\u2019s the uptick from those products that\u2019s driving this 2.8% growth we had in the quarter, much more than the overall market is growing.  For instance, the Astra Tech number is not in that 2.8, right, because this was internal growth, not total growth.  So for us, it\u2019s much more a story of innovation, bringing new products to market that are changing the way dentistry is done and getting great uptake from those\u2014even in a rough environment in Europe, getting great uptake from those in our portfolio.  ", "Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust", "Okay, great.  And maybe just a last question.  You mentioned the U.S. business or the U.S. implant market growing in and around double digits.  Just when you take a step back, are you seeing any change in the evolution of the market; and what I mean by that is a GP\u2019s willingness to move forward and take on a greater share of the implant business.  And if that\u2019s the case, are you seeing anything that you can point to on a share shift of maybe a GP being more willing to swim downstream in terms of the type of implant they\u2019re using?  Thanks, guys.", "Bret Wise", "Okay, it\u2019s kind of a complex question, but what we see is actually GPs being much more interesting in restoring implants rather than placing them.  We have in the past seen GPs or the GP market buy a kit, 10 implants, they place one or maybe they place two, and then it goes on the shelf.  We haven\u2019t seen a big uptake in GPs becoming large users of dental implants.  On the contrary, what we\u2019ve seen is GPs partnering with a surgeon to drive implant placement for their patients, but they\u2019re focused more on restoring the implant rather than placing it.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 SunTrust", "Okay, thanks for your time, guys.", "Bret Wise", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to George Humphrey at Deutsche Bank.", "George Humphrey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Morning.  First question just on Cad/Cam - could you tell me how quickly that grew in Q4 please?", "Bret Wise", "Well, Cad/Cam is not a major market for us.  That\u2019s more of an equipment market, and of course we\u2019re a consumable company.  We did launch this year a new monolithic material called Cercon ht.  We launched it Europe mid-year and we launched it in the U.S., really kind of a soft launch in December \u2013 it got approved by the FDA in November.  We\u2019ve seen great uptake in that product, which is a Cad/Cam type product, but it\u2019s a consumable more than the equipment.  ", "So with respect to the equipment, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re the best measure of how that market is going.", "George Humphrey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Sure, okay.  Thank you.  And then just going back to dental implants, was there much difference in performance between Dentsply and the Astra Tech dental implant businesses in Q4?", "Bret Wise", "Well, we view those as one business now.  That\u2019s why we gave you the pro forma number that we did.  And as we bring those two business together, for instance, certain product lines that used to be resident in one business are now being moved across to the other platform.  So like the rest of our businesses, when we give you insights we don\u2019t break it down by three or four businesses within a category.  We kind of give you insights on directionally how our business is doing in total, and that\u2019s why we gave you the mid-single digit number here on the call today.", "George Humphrey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, okay.  Thank you.  And then just the final question on the dental implants market as a whole, just in terms of your overall expectation of growth in 2012, do you see much difference in the premium part of the market versus the budget part of the implant market?", "Bret Wise", "Well, my comments earlier were about the premium segment primarily.  There\u2019s not much insight really into the budget part.  I mean, we do have an interest in a company in South Korea that\u2019s kind of a value implant player; but outside of that, it\u2019s hard to get good statistics on the value segment.  So the comments I had about probably low, perhaps getting into mid-single digit growth next year, were for the premium segment.", "George Humphrey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great.  Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "And that does conclude the question and answer\u2014oh, I\u2019m sorry, we do have one more question.  We\u2019ll go to Greg Halter at Great Lakes Review.", "Greg Halter \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Yes, good morning guys, and thanks for letting me in here at the end.", "Bret Wise", "You\u2019re coming in under the wire.", "Greg Halter \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Yes, thank you, and this goes across overseas, so a long question!  I know you have some sort of either options or warrants, or some sort of derivative in the Dio Corp, and I think the stocks doubled or tripled here recently.  Just wondered if you could make any comments on your position there.", "William Jellison", "Yeah, we did do an investment a year ago December in that company.  We\u2019re very pleased with the acquisition and our involvement in that at this stage.  We think that they\u2019re making some good progress on a number of fronts, but as far as the comment associated with their current stock price or what our expectations are on the conversion of\u2014you know, the converts that we do have out there or the rights, we wouldn\u2019t obviously comment on any of that at this point.", "Greg Halter \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Okay.  Thanks.", "Operator", "And that does conclude the question and answer session.  At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference back over to Mr. Leckow for any closing remarks.", "Derek Leckow", "Well thank you everyone.  That concludes our conference call today.  We thank you for your interest in Dentsply.  If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Investor Relations.  Goodbye.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

(NASDAQ:XRAY) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 25, 2012  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Derek Leckow - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Bret Wise - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Chris Clark - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Bill Jellison - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Analysts", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies", "Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "John Kreger - William Blair", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs", "Scott Green - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Operator", "Good day, and welcome to the DENTSPLY International third quarter 2012 earnings call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Derek Leckow", "Thank you all for joining us this morning to discuss DENTSPLY International's third quarter 2012 results. Joining us on the call today are Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, President and COO; and Bill Jellison, Senior Vice President and CFO. We'll have some prepared remarks and then we'll be glad to answer any questions that you may have.", "I hope you all had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is also available for download on our website at www.dentsply.com. We have also provided a set of supplemental slides to accompany this call also available for download under the Investor Relations section.", "Before we get started it's important to note that this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. A recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.", "As you can see in the release our results this quarter include a number of nonrecurring items under non-GAAP adjustments. Our comments on this call will focus on results including certain adjustments that provide operational insight beyond some distortion from these items. These items are noted on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the release. You will note that our earnings guidance is also presented on an adjusted basis.", "With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Bret Wise.", "Bret Wise", "Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our call this morning. Today we're very pleased to report another record third quarter, with strong sales growth driven by acquisitions, but also internal growth across all of our major regions. Adjusted earnings growth was also double digit, which we viewed as a strong performance in light of a relatively weak global economic environment here.", "Overall, looking at the market first, in our view, the global dental market in the third quarter was generally comparable to what we saw in the second quarter. The U.S. is stable, but not really robust at this point. Europe continues to be a mix of slow growth in the north and continued contraction in the south. Combined, the European market is probably flat, plus or minus at this point.", "The rest of world markets, which as you know comprise as many different countries for us continues to be a mix of slow growth in the developed regions that we have in that category, and mid to in some cases double digit growth in most of the developing markets that we include in rest of world. Overall, I'd say the dental market is doing okay at this point, but it's not great.", "Getting into details a bit, on our sales performance on an organic basis, it was notably better than what we view as the market growth at this point, across most geographic regions and also on most product categories.", "Our total growth with precious metals was a positive 12.3% and without metal was positive 14.8%. This 14.8% growth was driven by acquisition growth which was a positive 15.4%, but also the internal growth which was positive 4.7%, giving us constant currency growth for the quarter at a little bit over 20%.", "Our currency was negative by 5.3% and add of course straight headwind for earnings as we've discussed in our second quarter call, particularly with the weakening of the euro over the second and third quarter.", "The 4.7% internal growth was spread pretty equally across the regions, with the U.S. up 3.9%, Europe up 5.2% and rest of world was up 5.1%. Also important this is the first quarter in six that the orthodontics business has turned around and done accretive drug growth consistent with our re-launch plans. And of course, we've discussed on numerous of these calls stating all the way back to the natural disaster in Japan in March 2011.", "Internal growth ex-ortho in Japan was a positive 2.8%. So ortho added about 190 basis points to this quarter. Just as a reminder from our second quarter call, we did re-launch the orthodontics line in Europe late in the second quarter, so we were live in that market for the entire third quarter. In U.S. we went live in August in the third quarter, so the impact in this quarter was much less than the U.S.", "For competitive reasons, we're going to get away from giving you precise information by region on orthodontics. However, for your purposes, you should assume that the impact of orthodontics was much greater in Europe this quarter than in the U.S., due to the timing of the re-launch execution as discussed here. And Chris is going to have some further comments on orthodontics in his prepared remarks as well this morning.", "Lastly, on internal growth there's some important calendar implications for us this quarter impacting our measurement, meaning changes in shipping days, particularly for Astra Tech in September. Bill is going to cover this in more detail, but I think it's fair to say that the way the calendar happened to fall this quarter reduced our internal growth by more than a full percentage point.", "From a product category perspective, our internal growth was highest in the dental specialties, followed by consumables, both of which were positive, and lab was slightly negative in this quarter. There is always a lot of interest about implants, where our growth was slightly negative in this quarter and again that's impacted by the calendar days timing that Bill is going to cover.", "From an earnings standpoint, we're very pleased to see some expansion in our adjusted operating margins year-over-year this quarter. And that's despite having Astra Tech in the base, only for one month last year, and of course for all three months this year.", "We view this as an important step forward in restoring our operating margins to the pre-acquisition levels that we saw over time, and we're pleased to see the margin expansion begin to emerge here, although it's small, it's only 10 basis points on an adjusted basis. We're also targeting some good operating margin improvement as we move forward, despite being in a slow growth market at this point.", "The Astra Tech acquisition continues to perform well, although we would like to seeing a strong implant market at this point. The slower growth in the implant market is providing us with some opportunities perhaps flexibility actually to pursue synergies more quickly than we would have otherwise, if we've been in a different market circumstance at this point.", "We're also pleased with the continued growth of our healthcare business. We now refer to that business as Wellspect. It was renamed in August of this year, and is performing well even in the midst of a slow growth economy.", "To day we're focus of course on completing the integration, achieving the synergies, maximizing our digital portfolio and for the dental business realizing the benefit of being part of a much larger and focused dental products company.", "So at this point, we feel pretty good about how we've successfully made our through a slow growth market at this point. We've been through many currency fluctuations. We've absorbed in orthodontics supply outage to essentially consume 5% of our revenue and we feel pretty good about how we've integrated the largest acquisition in our history.", "But we do see a number of great opportunities going forward. Our product portfolio today is very strong as is our pipeline of products coming forward. We have good opportunities to improve margins as we continue to drive synergy opportunities from the integration but also in our base business as well. And we also believe that the broader dental market will gradually improve once job growth begins to take hold.", "Lastly, looking at the outlook and as noted on our release, we're modifying our guidance slightly for the full year by increasing the low end of the range, such that the new guidance for full year 2012 is now $2.19 to $2.24.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I'd like to now turn the call over to Chris Clark.", "Chris Clark", "Thank you Bret, good morning everyone. I'm going to take a few moments and provide some deeper insights into the recovery of our orthodontics business as well as a brief update on the Astra Tech integration efforts.", "As Bret mentioned that we've now re-launched our orthodontics product line on a global basis, with the U.S. re-launch following that of Europe and the rest of the world.", "In aggregate, the orthodontics business contributed the 190 basis points of internal growth on a global basis and also solid earnings improvements, both of which were inline with our internal expectations.", "We are pleased with the number of very loyal customers that have come back to the business as a result of product availability, and by our sequential progression over the past couple of quarters. We've been saying that we expected to recapture about a third of lost share quickly and that is proven to be true and very much inline with our expectations.", "One highlight that I'd like to mention from the past quarter was our European GAC Symposium in Lisbon last month, which was a significant gathering of our largest European customers and also had record international representation. We were very pleased with the positive tone of the customer base and the excitement regarding our plans and approach including our expanded investments in R&D which I commented on in last quarter's call.", "Our focus now expands to the next segment of lost customers who will be much more difficult to recapture as a result of the competitive nature of the orthodontics market and also the aggressive actions that we anticipate from our competitors as they try to hold on to these former GAC users.", "We anticipate an aggressive fight at the street level to gather back our customer base, really a battle on kind of an account-by-account basis over the next few years. We're helped in our efforts here by the strength of our brands and also by the goodwill that was created by our transparent approach through our customer base throughout the supply crises.", "While we continue to believe that this will be a multi-year competitive effort to recapture our lost market share, our performance to date trajectory are in line with what we expected and we believe that orthodontics will continue to be accretive to our growth rate during the recovery process.", "I'd now like to provide some brief comments on the Astra Tech integration efforts. In short, we continue to be pleased with the overall progress of the integration. We've now expanded our launch of the DENTSPLY implant organization to include Italy, Nordics, Benelux and the United Kingdom that's an addition to the launches in North American Iberia earlier this year. We're moving forward with other countries between now in early 2013.", "Sales training continues to be a significant focus and we're pleased with the competency and also the confidence levels that the sales organizations are showing with the combined product portfolio.", "Customer feedback to the combined organization and the integrated DENTSPLY implant's portfolio has been very positive, as was the reaction of the integrated DENTSPLY implants presence at the recent European Academy of Osseointegration Meeting that was held in Copenhagen earlier this month.", "On the field integration activities, we're also proceeding on track with our headquarter integration efforts, and overall we're very much inline with our cost synergy assumptions. Moreover, the business is increasingly addressing strategic areas such as clinical research, key opinion leader management, research and development and strategic marketing really on an integrated basis rather than as two separate businesses.", "We're very pleased with the level of collaboration and with the morale within the teams, as they clearly see the strength of the combined DENTSPLY implants organization and the significant market potential that we had moving forward. While the implant market may not be as strong right now as we might have hoped, the strategic and synergistic benefits of the acquisition and integration of every bit of what we expected and we remain very pleased with the progress.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison, who will cover the financial results for the quarter in greater detail.", "Bill Jellison", "Thanks Chris. Good morning everyone. Bret already discussed our sales growth within the quarter, but I would like to add a couple of additional comments. We believe the calendar had a negative impact on our sales growth by approximately 1 to 1.5 percentage points in the quarter due to two issues.", "First, the third quarter of this year had one less selling day than the third quarter last year. But second, the month of September this year had two fewer selling days than it did last year, and September is the only month in the quarter that Astra Tech has included for the calculation of our internal growth. Since that is when it began being included in our consolidated financial statements last year.", "So we believe on an internal growth that our internal growth rate of closer to 6% or closer to 4%, excluding ortho-Japan is more represented of the performance that we had in the third quarter of this year adjusted for days. This is only an estimate to allow you to better understand our results though for the third quarter.", "And looking at our geographic mix of sale ex-precious metals in the third quarter of 2012, the U.S. was 36% of our total sales. Europe represented 42% and the rest of the world was 22% of sales. Despite to recent weakening of the dollar within the quarter, we still were negatively impacted by a strong dollar year-over-year in the third quarter by 5.3 percentage points.", "Our earnings per share were also negatively impacted by FX rates in the quarter, and the impact was probably in the range of about negative $0.01 to a negative $0.02 per share. And on a year-to-date basis it was approximately a negative $0.04 to $0.05 per share. At current exchange rates, we expect the fourth quarter impact of exchange to be a little bit better, but still negative, probably in the 2% to 3% range, both on sales and on earnings.", "As Derek mentioned and as you can see in our earnings release in the quarter, this quarter included a number of items, which impacted our results. By excluding these items from our results, we believe the adjusted figures provide a more comparable picture of the company's performance, and most of the following comments exclude the impact of these items.", "Gross profit margins on an adjusted basis as a percentage of sales ex-precious metal content in the third quarter of 2012 were 56.9% compared to 56% for the third quarter of 2011. When compared to the same period last year, the gross profit margin rate was positively impacted by improved pricing, foreign exchange rates and products mix.", "SG&A on an adjusted basis was $256.7 million or 39.7% of sales ex-precious metals in the third quarter of 2012 versus 38.8% in the prior year's third quarter. Astra Tech, which runs higher SG&A expenses than our base business has a negative mix impact on SG&A expenses as a percent to sales. However, next quarter this will be in both the current year and the base period, and will be more comparable on a year-over-year basis.", "Operating margin rates based on sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis were 17.3% compared to 17.2% last year in the same period. Despite not having Astra Tech in two months of the base period, we were still able to begin to show some year-over-year improvements in the rate.", "As Bret noted, our orthodontic business began to show year-over-year improvement, once again in the quarter after the negative impacts we experienced with our supplier that was impacted by the natural disaster in Japan, which occurred in 2011. While the year-to-date impact is still negative by approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per share over last year, we expect this to be flat to slightly positive for the full year of 2012.", "Net interest and other expenses in the third quarter on a reported basis was $12.9 million compared to $20.8 million last year in the third quarter. This reduction in expense resulted primarily from about $12 million of acquisition expenses associated with the closing of the Astra Tech transaction in last year's third quarter, which we highlighted as an adjustment for our non-GAAP EPS.", "On an adjusted basis, this category is higher by approximately $4 million compared to last year in the quarter, which is primarily associated with higher interest expense as the financing for the acquisition was not in place for the whole third quarter of last year. Our reported tax rate for the third quarter was 25%. However, there are tax adjustments reflected in the rate of both periods.", "On an adjusted basis, our operating tax rate for this quarter was slightly over 23% compared to a slightly higher adjusted tax rate in the third quarter of last year. We believe that an adjusted operating tax rate of approximately 23% to 23.5% is reasonable, both for the balance of this year as well as for 2013.", "We continue to work on our international structuring as we finalize some of the activities and impacts from our recent acquisitions. And we continue to expect some favorable impacts from these efforts, especially in the areas of improved cash flow and repatriation efficiencies.", "Net income attributable for DENTSPLY International in the third quarter of 2012, on an as reported basis was $53.4 million or $0.37 per diluted share compared to $60.6 million or $0.42 per diluted shares in the third quarter of 2011. Net income attributable to DENTSPLY on an adjusted non-GAAP basis was $74.1 million or $0.51 per diluted share in 2012 compared to $66.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2011.", "Cash flow from operating activities in the first nine months of 2012 was approximately $202 million compared to $255 million in the same period last year. Cash flow from operating activities though in the third quarter increased approximately 10% compared to the third quarter of last year.", "Inventories increased in the first nine months of the year and supported the rebuilding of inventory for our orthodontics re-launch to support inventory levels during our integration activities and to support a couple of our other product lines. Cash flow was also negatively impacted by the timing of some tax payments that fell into the first half of this year.", "Our capital expenditures were $65 million in the first nine months of the year with depreciation and amortization at $103 million. Inventory days were 111 at the end of the third quarter of 2012 compared to 109 days at the end of the third quarter of 2011, and 100 days at the end of last year.", "Our accounts receivable days were 60 days, including slightly higher days for Astra Tech at the end of the third quarter of 2012 compared to 61 days at the end of the third quarter of 2011. And at the end of the third quarter of 2012, we had $56 million in cash and short-term investments and our total debt was $1.65 billion at the end of the third quarter.", "Finally, as Bret stated, we are updating our earnings guidance for 2012. As you recall, our previous earnings guidance was $2.18 to $2.24 per share on an adjusted basis. As we look toward a yearend, we're comfortable now with guidance for earnings on an adjusted basis of $2.19 to $2.24 per diluted share.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. And we'd thank you for your support. And we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies", "Bret or Bill, what was the core implant revenue growth experience, excluding the effects of the shipping day variances? And if you could comment just on the trend you saw by geography, I guess on a core basis that would be helpful? And then, I know one of your competitors called out pretty abrupt market issue in Japan. How did your business fair in that region, and could quantify the size of your implant revenue in that market?", "Bret Wise", "Core implant growth for us was slightly negative as we said. If you'd looked at days adjusted it would have been flat maybe slightly positive. I think the trends are that the U.S. market continues to grow, the European market probably is not growing at this point, and then the rest of world category kind of varies by country. And also a lot of those markets sell products by tender, so there can be kind of one large time sales that can be disruptive.", "Looking at the trends for us, the U.S. was our best market, Europe was next, rest of the world was the slowest market for us, but as you point out here that includes Japan where the market was disrupted by several events. Japan's not particularly large for us, probably Japan for the whole company is 4% of our revenue, and in our implant business it's probably around that plus or minus a percentage point or so. So they did have an impact on us in the rest of world category, but it's not really that significant as a percent of the total implant business.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies", "And then, Bill, could you give us an update on operating cash flow and CapEx expectations for the year, and should we anticipate CapEx to step down materially next year? And then, just what are your thoughts about capital redeployment in near term?", "Bill Jellison", "On the CapEx side of equation, I think that originally at the beginning of the year we said that CapEx spending was probably going to be in the $100 million to maybe a $120 million range. I think we've obviously looked at in number of those projects and some of that has been just taking time to actually get into the system and getting actually spent.", "I'd say that instead of that range, it's probably going to be in maybe the $90 million to a $100 million range at this year. But some of those projects are obviously still in the scope. They'll probably get spent next year. I believe that if you look at kind of spend level, it's probably going to be incrementally, again, higher than it is this year. So probably closer to maybe the $110 million to $120 million level next year, although we've not really given any specific guidance on the yearend or our CapEx.", "As it relates to cash flow, I think that we've got some good projects that are continuing to progress forward. We've built the inventories this year which have obviously had a negative impact on cash flow early on for a couple of specific reasons. I think that that's probably going to be reduced as we move forward over the next few quarters, as we ultimately get a couple of those areas back down to a level that we think is more appropriate. And I think that as we move toward the end of this year, we'll probably have again a strong fourth quarter cash flow.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse.", "Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse", "Bret, I just want to kind of follow-up with some of your opening remarks. You seem to talk about the U.S. dental businesses sort of continuing to grow at a relatively anemic pace and you talk about Europe being flat. And yet, I kind of look at the same-store results or internal growth numbers, constant currency that you guys have put up and days adjusted, it seems like it's close to the mid-single digit.", "And so I was wondering if you could just help us reconcile maybe what's enabling DENTSPLY to kind of grow, let's call it 300 to 500 basis points faster than the market. Is it a market share issue or is it something within your customer base? Any sort of color would be helpful?", "Bret Wise", "When you look at our internal growth this quarter at 4.7%, a 190 basis point of that is orthodontic, so something in the 2.5% to 3% range is kind of the organic growth rate. It would be higher on this days adjusted basis, but let's call it 2% to 3%.", "I do believe that the global dental market is growing a little bit slower than that. Certainly, Europe is a little bit slower than that. But our business has been taking share in Europe for numerous quarters in a row. I'm not sure how far back I should go, but I think ex-orthodontics we've been positive 11 quarters in a row, which is in many ways remarkable, given the economic circumstances there.", "Going back to 2008, 2009, we did increase and make some important investments in R&D. And we had been pretty transparent with investment community that was going to result in more new products coming out. Those products shipped in 2011, early 2012. They've been performing very well. I think they've been driving market share gains for us.", "So we have been performing above the market across numerous regions, I didn't really give the U.S. here, but U.S., Europe and also rest of world categories, because of those new product launches as they've rolled out. So even as we anniversary those, we're still growing above market and I think it's still attributable to the new innovation we've brought out, not only 2011, but 2012 and what we're going bring out in 2013.", "Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse", "Bill, if I can maybe just follow-up with you regarding the FX commentary you made. I think you suggested in 4Q that you saw that FX would have about a negative 2 to 3 percentage point impact on the topline and earnings. Could you just give us a sense for what some of your currency expectations are that you're using than you're existing model to come to those assumptions?", "Bill Jellison", "Generally, when we make comments on the currencies moving forward, at least from a street perspective, we're talking about rates that are consistent with kind of where they're running right now. So that would include something in the euro range that's in the 1.29 to 1.32 kind of range, and I think that that's probably consistent. That will allow us to be about half of the impact roughly. We had a little over 5% of a negative impact in the third quarter that should reduce that to close to half of that level by the fourth quarter if those rates hold up.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "Given that we've heard the commentary, it sounds a little bit more conservative in the last quarter. I wonder if you could give us an update on what you're seeing there with the regional breakout. Is this still a fairly isolated Southern European issue? Have you seen anything incrementally in the northern countries, some of the more centralized countries?", "Bret Wise", "I wouldn't characterize a commentary difference than they were before, if they came across that way, it wasn't intended. We're kind of seeing the same market development in Europe that we've been seeing for the last several quarters.", "The third quarter is always a little tough for Europe, because there is some extended vacation periods and so forth, so the entire market seasonally slows down in the third quarter. So you kind of focus your view on what happens in September in that market. But we haven't seen really any dramatic change there. We see the countries in the North continue to perform reasonably well in that environment, not robust growth, but growing, and we see the countries in the south still contracting.", "So that market appears to be stable, but not a great level right now. And as I said before or on our prepared remarks, U.S. seems to be comparable to what we saw in the second quarter as well. So the global developed market, part of the global dental market seems to be pretty stable.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "And one, on your comments around the med-tech tax is it still the view that we think we can pass that through here in the U.S. with some sort of adjusted approach to the market going into 2013?", "Bret Wise", "The med-tech tax the timing of this is getting close here, the law goes into effect January 1, 2013. There's been no guidance on implementation yet issued by the administration, and some guidance is needed here. But we're kind of operating under the belief that it will go live, despite there is some pretty widespread opposition in Congress due to the impact on job creation and innovation. And of course, there is always some chance that something will happen in the lame-duck session. But we're doing our planning as if that's going to go live. We're going to be implementing price increases January 1.", "We think those price increases were largely offset the medical device tax. I mean, there maybe some small leakage in one-line or another, but I don't think so this point. And we fully believe that our competitors will do the same thing and that cost, although it's small compared to the dentist, total cost will get pass through to the dentist.", "So we're starting to belief that it will go effective and that probably go effective without implementation guidance by the way. It will go effective, and we're going to implement price increases January 1.", "Operator", "We'll go next to John Kreger from William Blair.", "John Kreger - William Blair", "I realize you don't normally give former guidance for '13, until the fourth quarter call. But any kind of early thoughts if you think about the puts and takes. It seems like maybe a tougher macro-environment but also a better contribution from orthodontics, and perhaps Astra integration. Do you think you will be able to deliver better earnings growth perhaps in '13 versus what it looks like you'll get in '12?", "Bret Wise", "Well, John, as you noted in beginning of your comment, we're just entering our planning stage for next year. We do our budget planning throughout November, and we kind of arrived at an outcome and targets for next year, kind of, mid-December.", "So I don't want to bypass that process anyway. You did raise couple issues in your comments here. The orthodontics will be a factor next year, because it was the pretty large drag in the first half of 2012, although, we're getting earnings growth from orthodontics now in the back half.", "And the integration, of course, will be proceeding perhaps even at an accelerated pace as we enter 2013. So those are both important points for us to consider. Also important is our new product launches coming up, as well as, whatever currency impact we'll have on the business in 2013. I don't know Bill, do you have any thing to add at this point on the planning for next year.", "Bill Jellison", "No, I mean I think at this stage we obviously don't give any kind of directional guidance for next year until we release earnings. So I think Bret's comments are solid.", "There is obviously a number of things that we believe that we have at least driving our business that should allow us to continue to get growth above and beyond broader market level growths. And we think that those positive factors should hopefully have some benefits for us as we move forward, but we won't give any kind of official guidance until we get into the next year.", "John Kreger - William Blair", "Maybe as a follow-up can you just expand a bit more on what you're seeing in the orthodontics market as you fully re-launch your product line. Have you seen slowing in that broader market environment given the tough macro-environment or has that held up better than the implant market and what sort of pricing changes are you seeing from your competitors as they try to hold on to that share that they took from you guys in the past year?", "Chris Clark", "In terms of us having a read on the case start trend if you will, I'm not sure we're going to be the best parameter of that, because again obviously any change in that is going to pretty well muted on based on what we see in the context of our numbers with the recovery of bringing the most loyal customers back that we've gotten over the last couple of quarters.", "I mean, my sense is that it probably is a bit slower directionally, but in terms of real read on that, I think there is so much noise probably in our orthodontics numbers that that's going to be tough for us to tell or get more specific on. In terms of pricing, I think, maybe as I characterize my comments, we've gotten really the first third if you go back, pretty much as expected, maybe a little bit faster than expected.", "We do think that the next third is going to be more challenging in part, because of pricing and promotional activities from competition and there is no doubt that we're going to have to be aggressive to go after that. So I think that we're viewing this really as a prolonged street battle, and again, I think our team is up to it, but I think it's going to take us a while here for this next stage.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Brett, I know you don't want to go 2013 guidance, let me just ask a couple of questions here on maybe fourth quarter guidance. You come up against your first of a couple of very tough U.S. organic growth comps. I've talked to you guys over the last few months, it sounds like those new products that launched a year ago, kind of build a new base in business, so should we be looking at that U.S. organic comp as a big headwind or you should still be able to grow inline or above market after the higher base of those new product sales?", "Bret Wise", "We are coming up against two quarters where we are above 7% growth in the U.S., so we do have a very strong base there. But as you point out, the portfolio is expanded with these new products, and that's why we had that accelerating growth last year. So these products are now still growing albeit not quite at the pace they were then obviously. So it is a high baseline but we believe we can grow over that baseline and continue to deliver above market growth despite having a very tough comp to come up against for the next several quarters.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "And Bill, I know you don't typically or you don't you like to guide on the margin at all, but the fourth quarter last year was kind of the big margin hit down the 16% on adjusted operating basis. It was down I think 400 basis points, if I remember. Good margin this quarter even with Astra Tech in there, you were able to go up year-over-year by 10 bips. Should we be thinking about a strong like 100 to150 basis points expansion next quarter or am I too aggressive in those thoughts?", "Bill Jellison", "You're right, Jeff. We really don't get into kind of the specific operating margin improvements on a quarterly basis, but I think that we're obviously with our year end guidance. You know exactly what our guidance must be now for the quarter itself. So I think that you can probably kind of build into that based on kind of the expected growth levels that we're going to have for the overall business.", "But I think it's at least fair to say that we've had a couple of different comparisons that are in those numbers, both with orthodontic business as well as with not having Astra Tech in our base. So at least now on a comparable basis year-over-year period, you should at least get a better picture of kind of what that's looking like and how we're positioned moving forward.", "Bret Wise", "I would add to that we're very focused on operating margin expansion. And you saw that in our prepared remarks here, despite not having Astra Tech in filling the base, this is the first quarter we got some operating margin expansion post acquisition. And in our prepared remarks we intended to indicate that we're very focused on operating margin expansion going forward. So it's high on our list to priorities at this point.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Then last two, just quick follow-ups here for me. One, on the Japan dental implant issue, is that just an extension as we've heard of some of the issues in Korea about a year ago or so, just the media reports and things like that, or is there something structurally that could really suppress Japanese dental implant market for an extended period of time.", "And then last question, just on the med-tech tax, and I've heard from a few of my guys out there in the field that there could be a chance here that dental gets excluded completely from the med-tech tax. There is some legislative effort to at least underway on that. And I refer to this high as maybe as 50% chance that's happening or that could happen, any thoughts from your end?", "Bret Wise", "Jeff, first on the Japanese issue there was a little bit of a media flurry that was kind of anti-dental implants. And that did impact the growth here in the short term. I expect that to play its way through like that as happening in other markets with other products. There is inherently dangerous about dental implants, but it is a market where you need good research, you need some good clinical evidence. It takes a lot of clinical education which is expensive and many times it takes a direct sales force that can support the doctor.", "We have heard theories that dental implants don't no longer require that support and thus people should just cutout the customer support and drop the price. I don't think that's a formula for success in this market. This is a complicated surgery, and it requires that clinical support for the customer with the doctor to get good patient outcomes. So as far as Japan we think it will place it way through, but it might reinforce the need for good, strong clinical education behind these brands, behind these products.", "With respect to the med-tech tax, I don't want to go too deeply into that but there is always a possibility that there could be carve out for dental. I mean, dental wasn't covered in the coverage of the new healthcare law yet, isn't enough paying the tax which is kind of a disconnect. Other areas of healthcare that didn't have coverage in the act like hearing or vision were exempted, from the tax.", "So there is a lot of talk in Washington about getting something done on that. Getting things done in Washington in not easy even in a normal environment. I think it's particularly difficult right now. We'll have to see what happens in lame-duck session.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.", "Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs", "I just want to ask with regards to the implant market, what you've seen, how this is done globally? And what are your just general expectations for the implant market going forward?", "Bret Wise", "I think the implant market has probably slowed a bit. We've only got two competitors that have reported, one did a pre-release report. And so we're still waiting on a couple of companies to report to really have a full view of what the market is, but our guess is that market has slowed kind of sequentially here. Third quarter was not a great quarter to evaluate it, because dental implant market is more mature in Europe and Europe takes extended vacations in the third quarter. But if we had to guess, we'd say it's slowed a little bit.", "It is an expensive procedure. It's a discretionary procedure, and it's entirely possible that as the economy recovers that dental implants will start to grow more rapidly. We saw that in the early signs of recovery, maybe a year ago dental implant accelerated. And I think that would be true again if we saw some economic improvement over the coming months or quarters that we would see the same thing happening at dental implants.", "Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs", "Just to ask also, I see the U.S. sales were very strong internally this quarter. I just wanted to know are those sustainable? Do you think that those can be that robust going forward?", "Bret Wise", "Our U.S. sales growth I think was 3.9. I think that's actually in some ways a little bit slower than we had like, for instance fourth quarter last year and first quarter this year. U.S. market to us looks like its performing pretty stable with what we saw in the second quarter. We'll know more of course, when the distributors report in the coming weeks.", "But I think from our perspective, we see the portfolio we have and we see how the products are performing versus the market. We're continuing to take share in that market in the U.S. market. And thus, we believe basically whatever happens with the market we can continue to grow at a premium to that.", "Operator", "We'll go to Scott Green from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Scott Green - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "First, I had one on the med-tech tax. So are you assuming any pre-buying ahead of that, normally you get some pre-buying ahead of normal rate increases, and maybe this one is even more in the news, just curious about your thoughts there?", "Bill Jellison", "It's entirely possible that as we communicate our price increases to the distributor channels, entirely possible that some distributors will want to buy ahead of that price increase, and thus have that margin enhancement program or opportunity for them. It's too early for us to tell. We've kind of incorporated in our range. We're sitting over the $0.05 range for the fourth quarter, which is a little broader than we normally have.", "So with the high end of that range, that would probably encompass some buy-ahead on the med-tech tax issue and the price increase issue that we're going to implement. But at this stage, I think it's too early to tell. We probably won't know for sure what that's going to look like till we get well into December.", "Scott Green - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then can you elaborate on implant growth, just curious, you talked about you've re-launched the new DENTSPLY implants brand earlier in U.S. and Spain, and now Italy, U.K. What impact of that have when you re-launch on growth in those markets. Are you seeing a positive benefit from that, just on that new brand campaign?", "Bill Jellison", "No, I wouldn't characterize it that way. I am going to make a comment, and Chris has been closer to this than I, so he may have some further comments.", "But when we launched DENTSPLY implant, what it means is we're launching the integration meaning bringing the two organizations together. Frankly, that's more disruptive than helpful versus market growth. We end up changing rep territory. We pull reps out of the field to train them. We end up changing the product packaging et cetera and the CE set up changes as well.", "The clinical education setup kind of changes as well. So I think what you see with this launching DENTSPLY implants meaning from market-to-market, it's not really a boost to growth. It's almost more of an interruption, but that's where we're getting the synergies. That's where we're bringing the organization together to try to harvest the synergies from the acquisition. So I think its important stuff. Chris, I don't know if you have anything to add to that.", "Chris Clark", "I characterize it, Scott, as a kind of short term distraction. The necessary short term distraction for the reasons Bret mentioned. I mean, you've got the new reps with new things in their bag, new product in the bag, but they have to learn new territories, in many cases new boss, new managers in many cases.", "But the fact you kind of go thorough that because of the significant potential, obviously with mine organization. I think that what we're really excited about is just the positive reaction of our people, but also of our customer base to that combined portfolio and that combined business. And so again, I think that the necessary distraction, the short term to get the long term gain or medium term gains, and it's pretty much playing out very much as we expected.", "Scott Green - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then I think the last quarter you suggested that inventories would decline in the back half for the year, and I think they were up again modestly in the third quarter. Just curious if you could update us on that and how you see inventories in the field as well, that the dentists are holding?", "Bill Jellison", "Sure. I think two things there. So first of, in the quarter-to-quarter, at the end of the second quarter we had about 111 days. We actually still had about 111 days at the end of the third quarter. We're still obviously kind of in the midst of ortho re-launch and obviously some of the integration activities, and some of the new ones that Chris, just talked about.", "I'd say that it's probably still going to take us a few quarters to get the inventory backed down to kind of where we'd really like to have to in place. From a dealer perspective or the amount of inventory asset dealer levels, actually that inventory level is down year-over-year somewhat. So there is no increase in dealer inventory levels over the last year.", "Scott Green - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And lastly is there a way you could characterize 2013 in terms of product launches as stronger than normal or an average year or right at the normal?", "Bill Jellison", "The 2013 is IDS year, so in March we'll have the International Dental Show Germany. That's usually a show where we kind of accelerate product launches, for because we have access to that group every two years. So 2013 could be kind of slightly better than a normally year, I would say.", "Operator", "At this time we have no further questions. Mr. Leckow, I would like to turn the call back over to you for any additional or closing comments.", "Derek Leckow", "Well, thank you everyone. That concludes our conference call today. Thank you for your interest in DENTSPLY. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact Investor Relations. Good bye.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Derek W. Leckow", "Thank you very much, Mark. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International's first quarter 2013 results. Joining us on the call today are Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, President and CFO; and Jim Mosch, Executive Vice President and COO. We'll have some prepared remarks and then we'll be glad to answer any questions that you may have. I hope you had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of that press release is also available for download on our website at www.dentsply.com. We've also provided a set of supplemental slides to accompany this call, also available for download in the Investor Relations section.", "Before we get started, it's important to note that this call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. And a recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.", "As you can see in the release, our results this quarter included a number of nonrecurring items and other non-GAAP adjustments. Our comments on this call will focus on results, including certain adjustments that provide operational insight, excluding these items. These items are noted on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the release. You will note that our earnings guidance is also presented on an adjusted basis. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Bret Wise. Bret?", "Bret W. Wise", "Thank you, Derek, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our first quarter call this morning.", "Now before we get started, I'd like to comment on the executive changes that we made in early April, and as you probably have seen in our earlier announcement, Chris Clark, DENTSPLY's President, has now also assumed the Chief Financial role. As you probably know, while we have a matrixed organization and Chris now has responsibilities for essentially all the corporate functional organizations. That includes business development and strategy, finance, HR, R&D, manufacturing, logistics, IT and clinical. Chris has a -- has very strong business and finance skills and a keen knowledge of operational matters and, of course, will be playing a key role in taking our organization to the next level, including finding ways to better leverage our cost across the breadth -- the very broad platform that we have.", "Also announced in April is that Jim Mosch, DENTSPLY's Executive VP, has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Jim has a wealth of operating experience, including a very long tenure here at DENTSPLY, and this is a very strong next logical step for him and for the company. Jim has had oversight responsibilities for over half of our businesses in the past and now has responsibly for the full operating group. Jim also has strong capabilities in organizational design and management and is uniquely suited to this new role. Jim's been on these calls in the past primarily in his role in business development, so some of you already know him.", "Now we believe this new structure and the team we have in place will position us well to create value and capitalize on the opportunities that we have for the company going forward.", "Now before moving to our results, I'd like to make a few observations about market conditions. There are several factors that are creating noise in the results in the first quarter. And as we discussed in our fourth quarter call, the first quarter this year had 2 less selling days than last year. The number of selling days has a strong correlation to sales growth for direct businesses and, to a lesser degree, for businesses that go through distribution. Also we and most of our competitors implemented price increases January 1, which likely resulted in an inventory build in the channel in the fourth quarter. Both of these factors as well as timing of the holidays, major trade shows, et cetera, can distort results in the short-term.", "Cutting through all this noise, our take is that the U.S. market is generally consistent with what we saw last year, stable and continuing to grow, probably low-single digits. In Europe, we believe the markets may have had some mild weakening as we enter 2013, although again it's difficult to tell given the selling day issue and the timing of the holidays and the trade shows. Regionally, Southern Europe certainly is continuing to contract while Northern Europe showed a little less strength to offset by contraction in the south in the quarter.", "In the Rest of World category, which includes probably close to 100 country markets, we believe that the emerging markets continue to grow mid single-digits and, in some cases, higher or even double digits, while developed countries in this category are showing low growth or perhaps even flat growth.", "Obviously, all these market assessments are vast generalizations across very wide and diverse regions, but overall, that's how we see it at this point.", "Moving to DENTSPLY's results for the quarter. At a very high level, we had sales up 2.2% in total and 1.1% without precious metal. Earnings were flat, reflecting low internal growth, but also -- which, of course, was influenced by these 2 shipping days but also reflecting a decline in our operating margins year-over-year that we believe is temporary, and which we'll comment on further today on the call.", "First, on sales for the quarter. Internal growth came in at a positive 1.6%, with the U.S. up 1.9%, Europe at a positive 0.8%, and the Rest of World growing a positive 2.9%. Again, all of these percentages are as reported and do not adjust for the 2 less shipping days in the quarter. Also internal growth for the quarter x ortho and x Japan was up 1.3%. Overall, based on the reports that we've seen thus far, we believe this is above the growth rate for the global dental consumable market for the quarter.", "Internal growth of a positive 1.9% in the U.S. was led by our dental specialties products, lab and our non-dental businesses, with share side consumables basically flat. I think there are several important considerations here for the U.S., including that we were going up against a positive 7.4% internal growth comp in the first quarter of last year and we had 2 less selling days this year.", "This created a very high hurdle that was difficult to overcome this quarter. Complicating this a bit, we did implement price increases in the U.S. on January 1 of this year. And as we noted on our fourth quarter call, it's clear the dealers bought ahead of that price increase in the fourth quarter. That certainly had a positive impact in the fourth quarter and a negative impact here in the first quarter. But I think it's important to note that we believe that channel inventories probably still are high at the end of the first quarter this year.", "In Europe, as noted earlier, the markets are facing some pressure and we had some company specific events that also influenced our performance this quarter. Our internal growth in Europe was just under 1%. That was led by the dental specialties, the consumables and the non-dental products. Implants were negative in part due to our go-live events and our integration program for 2 very large markets in Europe in January. In one market in particular, Germany, we took that reps out of the field for an extended period of time for training. And that weighed -- that certainly weighed on our results there in the first quarter. We believe that this was an important and a necessary investment for us to make for the long-term despite the temporary disruption to sales that we experienced. Jim is going to speak to the integration and, of course, he'll speak to this issue further.", "In Europe, moving forward, we have several important product launches this year, which we believe gives us a good opportunity to boost growth in the back half.", "In Rest of World, our results were led by growth in our specialty group, but we also had good performance in lab products and in non-dental. We had particularly strong growth regionally in the Pacific Rim and in Latin America, while results were down in Japan.", "On a worldwide basis for the product categories, internal growth was strongest in our dental specialties and in our medical business while share side consumables were slightly positive and lab was slightly negative. And again, that's all -- all those comparisons are with 2 less selling days.", "Dental implants were negative this quarter, reflecting the integration and the 2 less selling days and, again, Jim will provide more color on this. Despite the temporary impact from the integration this quarter, we remain pleased with the overall performance of our global dental implant business, particularly given the market growth that we have right now. We also continue to be impressed with the medical device business we acquired in the same transaction 2011.", "Just a few comments on earnings. Adjusted EPS was flat for the quarter, and that's reflecting the low growth and the lower operating margin year-over-year as well as a slightly higher share count. The margin compression was due in part to the short selling days but also due to mix and the German integration. Both Jim and Chris have important factors to comment on here. But at a very high level, we have plans and we see good opportunities to improve the margin picture as we move through the year and also into next year.", "On guidance, we're looking at slower markets than we expected in Europe at the beginning of the year and currency exchange has moved against us by several cents. We're getting some help from a lower tax rate to offset both those issues but not enough to fully mitigate it. We have plans in place that should improve margins as we move through the year and some opportunities for capital deployment that should also help. Given all these factors, we see -- at present, we're revising our guidance to a range of $2.33 to $2.43 for the full year. Given the results for the first quarter, this implies earnings growth of 6.5% to 12.5% for the remainder of the year. That concludes my comments. I'd like to now turn the call over to Jim.", "James G. Mosch", "Thank you, Bret. From an operations perspective, let me provide an update on the integration activities and performance, our key product launches and also frame the expectations in these areas.", "I first like to talk about the implant integration. As you are aware, we'd been working over last year on the integration of Astra Tech Dental and DENTSPLY Friadent implant businesses. The overriding objective of this integration was to create a single global implant business. The integration process has been strategically and organizationally comprehensive. And while we recognized some synergies in 2012, we expect to recognize further synergies through manufacturing and in-sourcing, distribution consolidation and the leverage of overhead cost as we move forward. At the country level, the integration has involved the consolidation of locations, moving to a single sales force with a combined product portfolio and leveraging SG&A cost.  No doubt there is some disruption to this process as we merge territories, realign customers and retrain the majority of the organization. However, despite these challenges and distractions, we were able to grow above market in each quarter 2012.", "Our first country integration was North America, which occurred May 1, 2012. Systematically, we have moved country-by-country around the world to complete the integration. In January of this year, we integrated 2 large countries in Europe: Germany and France. At this point, we only have 1 large market left to integrate, which is Japan, and we expect to complete this process in the second quarter.", "Germany is our largest and most complex location, particularly as both of the pre-acquisition businesses enjoyed meaningful market share. As a result of the German integration, we combined the 2 organizations and created a single DENTSPLY implants Germany business. At the same time, we separated the previous corporate and manufacturing organizations associated with DENTSPLY Friadent and their world headquarters and integrated them into the corporate organization of the new DENTSPLY implants. One of the key requirements was the need to train the organization, particularly the field force, regarding product portfolios, new territory definitions and new procedures. As a result, the field force was out of their territories 2 to 3 weeks in Q1. Of course, having them out of the field did have a negative impact on our sales growth in Germany. This was impactful to the sales per day in the January, February time frame, but we then recovered in March and we expect to return to normal levels in Q2. However, I would like to underscore this impact to our implant business. Given the size of the German business, this had a meaningful impact on our overall results for the global implant business, where we saw sales contract low- to mid-single digits versus a solid prior year comparison. However, it is important to note that absent the impact in Germany, our global implant sales, constant currency, were flat to slightly positive for the quarter despite being short 2 billing days.", "I'd now like to move away from the implant business and review our sales and marketing activities. The first quarter was very active. There were 2 large dental conferences, the Chicago Midwinter in February and, in March, the biannual International Dental Show in Cologne, Germany. Both these shows were very well attended and we showed and launched a wide range of new innovations at each. In total, this included more than 10 new products, some are in the market now and others will launch later in the year. Of particular interest are the following: in the preventive segment, we launched 2 new fluoride varnishes, NUPRO varnish and Durashield, that have a higher fluoride release and faster hypersensitivity relief than other products in the market. This is important as this is a fast-growing segment where previously we did not have a competitive offering. In the restoratives area, we launched a new curing light, SmartLite Focus, which is a cordless curing light; and also a new universal composite, TPH Spectra, which is offered in both low and high viscosities with a simplified shading system to meet the handling preferences of the clinician.", "In prosthetics, we showed the new high strength glass ceramic, CELTRA, and also a millable cobalt chrome product, Crypton, that greatly enhance our offering in the important CAD/CAM area of dentistry. These products are expected to begin launching in the second and third quarters of this year.", "In endodontics, we launched the new rotary NiTi file system, ProTaper NEXT, which is a continuous rotary system that provides versatility, efficiency and safety to the endodontic procedure.", "In implants, we are launching a new intraoral welding product called WeldOne that will allow clinicians to connect newly placed implants in the oral cavity to prove initial stability and provide more prosthetic options immediately in the offertory versus what is now, in many cases, a multi-visit process to complete the final prosthetic solution. Of course, there are several other new innovations that we did show in the quarter, but these represent the best example of the innovations we are currently bringing to the market. I look forward to reviewing our new products and business activities in future calls. I would now like to turn it over to Chris Clark to review the financial results.", "Christopher T. Clark", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Let me build on some of Bret's comments and provide a bit of a deeper dive on some of the key income statement elements and also provide some additional color on our balance sheet as well as the cash flow for the quarter.", "Our sales growth, excluding precious metals, of 1.1% and flat adjusted earnings per share for the period probably don't provide the best barometer of performance given the calendar comparison. As we look at our business performance compared to the market information available, we believe that our internal growth rate of 1.6% is probably slightly above market growth for the quarter with the impacts of the calendar and the directionally softer European market as well as the specific impact of the implant integration in Germany affecting our results this quarter.", "Currency translation was a headwind of approximately 60 basis points on sales for the quarter and it was about 100 basis points worse than our expectations coming into the period. The gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the first quarter was 58.2% of sales, excluding precious metals. That's 190 basis point improvement sequentially, but 130 basis points below our high-water mark of 59.5% in the first quarter of 2012.", "Let me put that in perspective. Since the date of the Astra Tech acquisition, we have reported average non-GAAP gross profit margins of 57.7%. So compared with historical averages, this performance is favorable, particularly when you consider the 2 less selling days. However, there are still a couple of important factors that weighed on the results in the quarter. First, we estimate that the medical device excise tax in the United States reduced gross margins by about 40 to 50 basis points compared to prior year. This was obviously not in the baseline from last year and will -- and this will also continue to impact us moving forward, along with the rest of the medical device industry. The other 2 factors impacting quarterly gross profit rate comparison in the prior year are mix and transactional currency. Mix was slightly negative in the quarter primarily due to the disruption from the implant integration activity in Germany, and we believe this should improve sequentially moving forward now that the German integration is in our rearview mirror. With respect to the transactional currency impact, the key negative driver is the impact of the strong Swedish krona compared to the euro and the British pound. While we have some hedges in place to mitigate some of the risk associated with movements in these cross-currency rates, the effect was not fully mitigated in the quarter.", "Moving to SG&A expenses. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $283 million or 42.1% of sales, excluding precious metals. Expenses as a percentage of sales were down 50 basis points compared to prior year but were higher than our long-term baseline due to the cost of the biannual IDS show in Germany and also sale seasonality. These impacts were temporary and we expect that we will generate some improvement in these measure as we move through the year. Our expense ratio for the full year last year was 40.5%. We expect to be able to beat that this year.", "Adjusted operating margins for the quarter was 16.2% of sales excluding precious metals. That compares to 16.9% in the first quarter the last year. This reflects the gross margin SG&A impacts I've just described, including the medical device tax, which caused 1/2 to 2/3 of the change versus prior year. As we move forward, one of our -- one of the key opportunities our new management structure provides us is the ability to focus more strongly on driving leverage and increased effectiveness across our operating units and franchises and to engage our functional organizations in a more integrated fashion. In short, we have the unique opportunity to more thoroughly leverage our size and also the proximity to our customers that our franchise structure provides relative to cost, marketing impact, innovation efforts and manufacturing, among other opportunities. I look forward to working with our global management team to help drive these efforts.", "Our reported tax rate for the first quarter was 4.5%, and that reflects the number of significant tax adjustments in the period. The operating tax rate was 21.8%, which is 120 basis point improvement compared to the 23% operating rate in the first quarter 2012. This reflects some significant work on the part of our global tax team to minimize future tax impacts and also to allow for efficient repatriation of foreign-generated cash flows. These efforts resulted in approximately $0.01 positive impact on adjusted earnings per share in the quarter, and we think that this is going to hold for the year. In addition, adjusted results include a one -- sorry, adjusted results exclude a onetime positive tax impact of approximately $0.08 per share in the quarter, primarily relating to the impacts of the 2012 Taxpayer Relief Act that was enacted in early 2013, including the 2012 R&D tax credit. So to clarify, the benefits of the 2012 act are removed from our adjusted results.", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as reported basis in the first quarter was $71.7 million or $0.49 per diluted share. And this compares to $53.3 million or 37% -- $0.37 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. These results included a number of items, which we've listed in the schedules in the press release. On an adjusted basis, earnings were $75.2 million or $0.52 per diluted share compared to $75.3 million and also $0.52 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. In addition to the items already mentioned, EPS was negatively impacted in the quarter by currency by about $0.02 per share versus the prior year. This more than offset the benefits of the lower tax rate that I mentioned previously. Based on current rates, we estimate the earnings headwind from currency for the year to be between $0.04 and $0.05 per share.", "Operating cash flow in the quarter was $36 million, up nicely from $20 million in last year's first quarter. I should note the first quarter is typically our lightest quarter from a cash flow standpoint, so we should see operating cash flow increasing in subsequent quarters.", "Inventories increased about 4 days from December in anticipation of our new product launches. Inventory now stands at 110 days and that's flat in terms of days compared to prior year. Accounts receivable days were 59 days at the end of March, and that was up 1 day compared to last March.", "Capital expenditures were $24 million in the quarter. And we estimate the capital spending to ramp up during the year to a full year level in the $120 million range. Depreciation in the quarter was $20 million and amortization was $12 million compared to $15 million in the prior year period.", "Our net debt-to-capital ratio continues to improve and it stood at 39% at the end of the first quarter. That compares to 45% last March and 39% at the end of December. We anticipate that ratio continuing to gradually improve as we move through the year. I would note that we are approaching our long-term target range of between 35% and 40%.", "We see more flexibility to create value through our capital deployment strategies. We did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter but still have approximately 14 million shares available for repurchase based on the company's authorization, and we do view a reasonable level of share repurchases as an opportunity as we move through the year.", "We're also continuing to be active on the M&A front and are continuing to dialogue and actively set specific opportunities. During the first quarter, we completed one small acquisition and would not be surprised to see more acquisitions as we move through the year.", "Finally, as Bret stated, we're revising our 2013 earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.33 to $2.43 on an adjusted basis. This reflects the positive impact of the operating tax rate as well as the currency headwinds, our first quarter results and our assessment of the current dental market conditions. That completes our prepared remarks. We certainly thank you for your support, and we'd now be glad to take any questions that you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we take our first question from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.", "Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions, if I could. Essentially, Bret, if I heard you correctly, it kind of sounds like maybe Europe took one step backwards this quarter, and I thought that inconsistent with what we've heard from other vendors. I'm just sort of curious if you have any sort of anecdotal data points or anything that would put that in a little bit more perspective? Is it just macroeconomic or is there something else that we should be thinking about now that we're also almost into mid-May.  I mean, what have you seen thus far in the second quarter?  Anything worth calling out?", "Bret W. Wise", "Thanks, Glen. Certainly, Northern Europe differs from country to country but it was slightly weaker this quarter. If I had to talk about specific countries, I'd say France, in particular, seemed to be weaker. Germany seemed to be about the same and, of course, several other countries. But generally, just a slightly weaker Northern Europe. And it wasn't as strong as it had been to allow it to offset weakness in the southern part of Europe. In our guidance -- or the adjustments to our guidance that we made today, we're reflecting that we're not -- we don't see indications that that will turn around as we move through the back half of the year here, although we're encouraged by some recent reports about manufacturing in Germany, for instance, that seem to be rather strong in April. I think it's hard to translate that into the dental market without some specific data points. But from a very high level, Europe just seemed to be a little bit weaker than we had experienced last year.", "Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And maybe if I could just follow up on that, related to margins, you said in the press release that, obviously, the slower revenue growth may have impacted margins to some extent. But you also called out specifically some important investments made by the company during the quarter, which maybe depressed margins a little bit. And I'm not sure if you were referring to what we talked about with respect to Germany and the implant business or if there were some other investments. And I'm trying to get a sense if those investments were kind of onetime or are they going to be ongoing within the cost structure? Any additional details?", "Bret W. Wise", "Sure. The investments we were referring to, the primary one was the integration in Germany that Jim discussed in more detail. That certainly is a onetime event, and we believe we got that behind us now. It's important to get that done, but it did depress margins somewhat in the quarter. The other investment was the International Dental Show in March. We've made commitments for those expenses far in advance. We kept those commitments. We had a great show at IDS, but we weren't able to -- even though we brought SG&A down by 50 basis points, with lower growth and with the IDS expenses, the fact those expenses were in the plan for the quarter constrained us a little bit about -- towards bringing expenses down further. So those are the 2 primary items.", "Operator", "For our next question, we'll move to Jeff Johnson at Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Bret, wondered if I could just focus on the dental implant business for a second. First, I don't think I heard a U.S. number.  If you didn't give it, maybe even just some qualitative comments around U.S. And then in Germany, hearing especially the January and February impact of taking the sales force out for a few weeks there, wondering if you could maybe talk about March, April, May trends there just -- it sounds like it's bounced back. But the other thing we're hearing in Germany is that the dental implant market itself may have slowed. You had the #2 player there in Germany introduced kind of a lower-priced prepackaged system here recently. Just wondered kind of how you think of the German dental implant market here over the next few quarters?", "Bret W. Wise", "Okay. I'll try to do that and, Jim, if you have any further insights, you can add them. Our results x Germany were positive for the quarter even though we had 2 less selling days. We view that as a -- certainly compared to the announcements we've seen from other people, we view that as a pretty strong performance. We did take the hit in Germany by taking the reps out of the field early in the quarter. We saw that reflected in our sales per selling day, particularly over the first 2 months of the quarter where there was some recovery late in the quarter of that, and I'm not sure about April, I haven't seen the April numbers yet. But as far as we can tell, this looks like a company-specific event early in the quarter and, to us, doesn't really provide evidence that the market there, in total, has changed in any way. Jim, do you have anything that you would add to that?", "James G. Mosch", "Yes. Jeff, from a standpoint of Germany, I would say that we don't feel that there was an underlying softness in the market. There was a lot of noise. Obviously, for us, there was some particular noise regarding the integration. But in addition to that, I think the 2 less selling days and the fact that there was an additional week of Easter versus the prior year in Q1, it just created some noise in the market that didn't lead us to believe that there was anything other than that and the overall market was okay. You also asked a question about Camlog's introduction. And obviously, this is a -- this was a pretty big announcement for them at IDS. And from our perspective, we look at this as somewhat of an effort on their part. It's a fairly standard implant system with some fairly standard but limited applications. As you probably know, Camlog is generally priced a little bit below the premium players in the German market, but not at the level of the value players. So from our perspective, and I can't say that we totally understand their strategy, but we believe that this is an effort on their part to retain some of their customers that may be reaching into the value segment and also, obviously, maybe participate in the value segment on some level as well. I think long-term, average sell price stability, I think, could be a challenge, but we don't see this as a direct impact to the premium market in Germany.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful, Jim. And Bret, not to push you here, but I don't know if you're being evasive or just not giving us the U.S. number and that's fine, but qualitatively, anything on U.S. specifically? And is it fair to kind of quantify the impact of pulling these guys out in Germany for the few weeks that, maybe $0.02 to $0.03, that's kind of backing into the model, what I'm seeing anyway?", "Bret W. Wise", "Sorry, Jeff, I forgot that you had asked about the regional assessment. Actually Jim, you probably -- you have those numbers. You're closer to those numbers than I am, why don't you go ahead?", "James G. Mosch", "Yes, Jeff. One of the things I -- what's interesting about that, we feel that in the U.S. that we grew at or above the market in North America. One of the interesting dynamics for us was that, as I mentioned early on, we went live May 1 last year. And obviously, just from that standpoint, we had some activities leading up to that that kind of clouded the picture in Q1. So it's kind of difficult for us to make a true year-on-year comparison from that perspective. But I would say, overall, we are very pleased with our growth in North America.", "Operator", "And we'll move next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.", "Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just looking at the U.S. internal growth, I was wondering if you could share what the impact actually was in the quarter from the med tech tax? I was just wondering -- I know you had commented on this before, but just wondering, were you actually able to fully pass that on to customers in the quarter?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes. Rob, it's Chris Clark. What I'll -- we took a price increase in January that included a number of factors, including tax and other items. And when we passed that through, I think, at this point, we do believe that the bulk of that is peaking, consistent with what we've seen in the past.", "Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's fair. And then I know you mentioned an acquisition in the quarter. I was just wondering if you'd be willing to give any more specifics around what area that acquisition was in. And then it sounds like you are currently evaluating other deals. Maybe even just broadly, being respectful of the competitive landscape, maybe just broadly what product categories you're most interested in? And I guess, in particular, high tech has continued to perform fairly well within dental. Just curious, Bret, if maybe any comments or thoughts about moving further up the value chain within the dental offering?", "Bret W. Wise", "Okay. First of all, the small acquisition we did in the quarter was a small sales and marketing organization outside the U.S. It's really immaterial. As far as the categories we're looking at, I don't like to get into a lot of specifics there, but certainly, we're looking at acquisitions in the specialty categories, in the consumable categories. Those are probably the highest focus at this point. With respect to high tech, as you know, we're a consumable company and we're very focused on being able to participate in high tech in the consumable categories, meaning, ultimately, our products are what end up in the patient's mouth. And there's a lot of buzz about digital dentistry right now. Digital dentistry is a facilitator for products that end up in the patient's mouth. But ultimately, we see our products as part of that facilitation, not necessarily being the high tech item itself but being what is facilitated to get the dentistry done.", "Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then I -- just quickly, the last one I had, and maybe I missed this. I didn't hear an update on the ortho relaunch. Just wondering, any comments around how you're feeling about the market share regain there?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes. We're very much on track relative to our expectations. I think we've commented, I think, on the last call that we thought we'd recover about 1/3 of the lost market share and I think that we also commented that from thereon out, it's going to be a little bit of a tougher fight, if you will. That said, I think we're very pleased with the progress we had in the first quarter. We've just had the AAO show, which is the largest orthodontic show in the year this past week in Philadelphia. And I would say that we were very pleased with the results from that show as well as the customer sentiment regarding our product line. So we're very happy.", "Operator", "For our next question, we go to the Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just a question on the outlook for the balance of the year. It's easy to understand how there were a number of puts and takes in the quarter that made the quarter a little atypical. I wonder if you could use that context to help us think about the drivers of the earnings acceleration over the balance of the year, given the magnitude, something like -- not 1,000 basis points but quite a bit of EPS growth acceleration over the balance of the year. How do you think about -- or how are you telling us to think about the organic growth profile? Are we back to north of 3% on a consistent basis? And do we see SG&A trend back to, I guess, where The Street had been looking for them? Is that a really simplistic way to think about the model that you would think is appropriate?", "Bret W. Wise", "Well, I think a couple of things. One, our growth in the first quarter here was 1.6% organic with 2 less selling days. So it's hard to adjust that for the selling days, but certainly it would've been reasonably higher without the 2 less selling days. As we look at our markets around the world, we see the U.S., it seems to be doing fine and consistent with last year. Europe's a little weaker, but some of the issues that we had in the first quarter, including an adverse mix, the implant integration, et cetera, are things that we can overcome going forward on a -- we can likely overcome going forward, but we don't think we can make up for the impact that we had in the first quarter. So I think that's the way we think about it. The plans we had for the year, we think, are intact. We can't quite make up for what happened in the first quarter. We are going to have a little bit more headwind from slower markets in Europe as we move for the year, and we're very focused on expense leverage, as we've commented in our comments today, although I don't want to quantify that at this point. Chris, you got anything to add to that?", "Christopher T. Clark", "No, I think those are the primary drivers. Agree.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And then one more specific question on the implant markets. There's been some disruption in the Japanese market with commentary in the media. It seems like that is starting to reverse. And would you agree with that characterization that the noise is starting to fade? And does that set us up for a better trend over the balance of the year, maybe a rebound over there?", "Bret W. Wise", "Yes. You're absolutely right. I mean, obviously, last year was very difficult and that impact probably led through most of the year. I think we saw -- I would say we saw a stabilization in the first quarter. There has been some efforts, industry efforts, with the Japanese Dental Association and others to try and quell some of those issues. And we're hopeful that that will improve things. Do we -- would we predict a rebound at this point in time? I don't think I would be that strong quite yet. I think we need to see, probably another quarter of activity before we have a better understanding of what's going on in Japan.", "Operator", "And for our next question, we'll move to John Kreger with William Blair.", "John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up on Japan. I think you mentioned that that was the last major market where you need to integrate the implant business. Do you expect Japan, therefore, to be soft in the second quarter similar to what you saw in Germany this quarter?", "Bret W. Wise", "No, I don't. I think the Japanese integration is not as complex from the standpoint of what we did in Germany. Germany was a very complex integration because that was the former kind of world headquarters for Friadent. So it's a larger organization, we have a lot of moving parts there. Japan, I think also, obviously, it's at the end, so we've got a lot of internal knowledge regarding that integration. And we expect this should go as others. And I think we're well prepared for that. We don't really anticipate any disruption there.", "John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Great. And then Chris, in terms of the guidance, can you just clarify, are you assuming that Europe is kind of stable from Q1 levels for the rest of the year or deteriorates further?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes. We're basically saying what we're seeing in Europe -- that systemic to Europe would continue through the rest of the year. Obviously, the determinate implant integration we're viewing as a first quarter onetime factor, that is now behind us.", "John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Excellent. And then one last one. I think in the past, your annual price increases have been in the 1% to 2% range. Can -- with the med tech tax, following up on Bob's question, can we assume in the U.S., therefore, it was more like 3% to 4% or maybe a bit lower than that?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes. I would characterize our global price increase -- I think we made this comment on the last call as well that typically, globally, we're probably in the 1.5% to 2% range. And I think on the first quarter call, we made the comment that we're going to be north of 2%. I'll stick with that comment, John. Obviously, if you look at it geographically, we'd be a little bit higher in the United States relative to x U.S. more than likely.", "Operator", "We'll move now to Jon Block with Stifel.", "Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Maybe the first question, Bret, just some high level thoughts on the endodontic business. I know you don't really give specific commentary there, but how did that perform? And then I think it was at Chicago Midwinter when Cybron introduced a new reciprocating file.  Can you talk to -- I knew that your sales guys are giving you there that's having at least a revenue impact in the field?", "Bret W. Wise", "Okay. Jonathan, I'm going to start the response here and then pass it to Jim. The endodontic business is performing very well. We had some key innovations that came out about 1.5 years ago that's very popular in market and growing rapidly. We also introduced some new file system at Chicago and at the IDS, which has gotten rave responses from customers. With respect to the competitive -- the response from the competitor, I'm going to let Jim address that as well as anything else he has to add to what I've said here.", "James G. Mosch", "Yes. As far as -- from the standpoint of the overall market, I think what you've seen in our endodontic business, really over the last 2 years, is really successive product launches. We made some pretty significant investments in R&D in the endodontic business really going back about 4 or 5 years ago. I would say that we're bearing the fruits of those efforts at this point in time. Those new products have been very well received in the marketplace. And I believe, in many cases, we've been fortunate to really set the standard in the marketplace. As far as the new products are coming onboard, certainly we believe that competitors will attempt to emulate those products. But endodontics is not a one-product category and new products that we've offered, that we've launched in both -- really 3 different filesystems, a new -- got a purchase fill-in systems, irrigation systems and also new motors in apex locators that improved the procedure as well as diagnostics. I mean, I think we're really offering a very updated, innovative, comprehensive solution for the customers. And we believe that we're comfortably positioned in that market versus our competitors.", "Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Perfect. Great, very helpful. And then, Chris, I think this one's for you. You guys are bringing down guidance by about $0.05. I believe you mentioned tax is lower and will be a beneficiary of about $0.01 per quarter. So if you call it sort of lowering by $0.09, is 1/2 from FX and 1/2 from ops? That was going to be the first question. And if that's true, in terms of ops, what's really the driver, is it -- seems Europe might be a little bit weaker relative to where you guys were 3 months ago?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes, thanks. I'd probably characterize as the following: tax is obviously favorable in the range that you mentioned, basically offset by incremental FX going the other way. And then you're looking at basically about $0.03 in terms of really kind of the first quarter miss, if you will, in terms of the operational side on -- due to softer Europe but as well the German implant integration in that mix, and we're carrying that forward. And then basically carrying forward a little bit additional softness -- or continuing softness, if you will, for Europe. So those would kind of be the building blocks that I would use to think about it.", "Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Then very last question. Bret, Europe up 0.8%, but China actually had down consumables year-over-year. So do you think the market softened but you're still confident that you're gaining share over in Europe?", "Bret W. Wise", "Yes. I think that is pretty clear we are. We've seen -- of course, we've seen all the dental implant companies report. We've seen the largest distributor report. Our numbers are clearly above the average of those numbers and we feel pretty comfortable that the new product introductions and the innovation, such as the innovation that Jim referred to earlier, are driving above market performance for us at this point. Just a moment on the market, I mean, we had been running closer to 2% growth in Europe. This quarter came in a little bit under 1%, although there's that 2 day selling issue, which clouds the picture, but so apples-to-apples, we feel that we're performing about like we were in Europe, although we feel like the markets have weakened just a little bit, just perhaps as we entered 2013.", "Operator", "We move now to Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Bret, could you elaborate on the Rest of World experience in the quarter? It seemed to decelerate a little bit. Were there any unusual channel dynamics?", "Bret W. Wise", "Yes, let me give you some insights on that. Rest of World was 2.9% for us this year. And again, that's not adjusted for the selling day issue. What we saw this quarter was a very strong growth in the emerging market elements of Rest of World. As I commented, Japan was down, which shouldn't be a surprise to anybody given the reports that we've seen on the implant companies in Japan. And then the other developed markets within our Rest of World category were kind of flat or slow growth or maybe slightly down. So the report here is the result of average -- it's the average of those emerging markets which are growing faster, the developed portions that are growing slower and the impact of the 2 selling days.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And Chris, any chance you could break out the impact of FX on the gross margin line between both translation and transaction?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes. I mean, for the year or for the quarter?", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Both, if that's possible.", "Christopher T. Clark", "Well, the way to think about it is there's a lot going on, Brandon, in the FX line or in the FX rates. Obviously, translation was slightly negative for the quarter. We think that's probably going to be roughly neutral to a little bit positive probably for the year. But transaction is probably the primary challenge, specifically, the lot of interactions between non-US dollar rates given, basically, our business model and business structure. And then also, as Bill mentioned I think on the last call, the impact of our hedging activities, basically we're going to be -- more beneficial or stronger benefits last year compared to this year.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And is there a yin dynamic going on with -- in terms of the revised outlook? And can you explain or just walk us through in terms of how you interact or how you transact with your ortho partner there? What are the thought that might have been a slight positive given your source product?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes, it actually helps and hurts. Relative to the sourcing of the orthodontic product, yes, there is. It does certainly -- the movement does help us there. Unfortunately, it also hurts us in terms of the translation impact coming back from our business in Japan. So you got to kind of assume, you can't kind of get away with those 2 factors.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "All right. And then just what should we be thinking about in terms of operating cash flow for the year? That would be helpful.", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes, and again, as we look at it, operating cash flow, we think, should be improving sequentially as we move forward. The first quarter typically is our lighter quarter. And again, our operating cash flow expectations for the year are slightly above what we had last year.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Yi-Dan Wang with Deutsche Bank.", "Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So I have 2 questions, one on implants and the other one on your consumer care business. So on the implant business, I missed the first part of your call, so apologies. Did I get it right that the business was in low to mid single-digit decline, including the negative impact of the 2 fewer selling days?", "Bret W. Wise", "Yes, implants were down globally low to mid single -- or low to mid single-digits, not correcting for the selling days. And if you take Germany out, it was flat to up, again, not adjusting for the selling days.", "Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. And then to what extent would you say that business has benefited from the IDS? And also with the U.S. integration down for a few quarters now, what cross-selling benefits are you seeing coming through so far? And what could we see going forward?", "Bret W. Wise", "Yes. As far as the IDS is concerned, we had a fairly big presence at the IDS. I think this was mainly very much our -- in many ways, our global launch of the new DENTSPLY implants as we have been going through the integration over the last year. It was a good show. Sales were as expected. As you know, something about the IDS consumable sales are not as impactful at the IDS as is equipment sales. I think clinicians definitely go to that show to see the equipment that they can't see in their offices. But it was a good show for us. We're able to launch some new products. And so we were comfortable with what we accomplished at that show. As it relates to the U.S., you're absolutely right. We launched the integration May 1 of last year, and we're now coming up on 1 year anniversary of that. And we've seen some good successes from that. The organization has been fully trained. They're doing well. They're selling the entire portfolio. And we've seen some excellent cross-selling that's come out of that. First of all, it's allowed us to put a little bit more sales resources on the previous DENTSPLY brands, as DENTSPLY was a smaller organization in North America. And from a cross-selling standpoint, it's -- so our Isis bars and bridges, we've fully launched that product. That has now -- you'll able to order that online via the Atlantis WebOrder system, that we've had some excellent uptake in that area. In addition, we have a good portfolio of bone-grafting products in the North American market and the new larger organization is now taking that on and has found that to be successful. And then quite frankly, between the 2 organizations, having a larger organization now selling the Atlantis customized abutments, that has also been an impact. So we're definitely seeing the leverage from the larger organization and the broader portfolio products.", "Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. So I mean, it sounds like you should be seeing quite a lot of benefits but from your commentary earlier about your performance in the U.S. relative to your peers, am I right in interpreting that we're still at the very early stages of seeing some of these benefits? And if so, should be a lot more to come?", "Bret W. Wise", "No, actually my earlier comments indicated that we were performing at the market or better, and that we are quite pleased with our North American business. So we feel that we are beyond the integration and that organization is performing at a good level.", "Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And would you be able to give us just maybe a bit better idea on how much better you are versus the market?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Well, I mean, the beauty is in the eyes of the beholder here. We're not sure exactly what the market is, but we think the market's somewhere in the mid single-digit range in the U.S., and you should reflect on our comments in comparison to that.", "Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then on your constant [ph] care business, would you able to give us how fast that business -- or how that business developed in the quarter and your expectations in the short and also in the midterm with your key competitors being quite active in upgrading the U.S. intermittent capital market and also launching from what we can see to be quite differentiated products?", "Bret W. Wise", "We're very happy with that medical business that -- I know that you weren't on earlier, but that was in our comments. That business performed as we went through the regional growth rates.  We commented in each region that that was contributor to our growth rate, and we're happy with that. We have some -- we launched in January a new product that we think is pretty innovative and is getting a good uptake there. We've been taking share for the last 18 months in the female market off a new product as well. So we're feeling pretty good about that medical business and the outlook, not only in the U.S., which you're raised, which is a growth market, but outside the U.S. as well.", "Operator", "Our next questions will come from Steven Valiquette with UBS.", "Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So just a question here. You mentioned the channel inventories are still a little bit high at the end of the first quarter in the U.S. Just trying to reconcile that.  To me, that would sort of imply maybe that the second quarter sales will still be a touch soft in relation to that.  Then the flipside, you also referenced the tough comparison you had in the U.S. in the first quarter was a 7.4% internal growth, and that comp should get easier in the second quarter. So if we kind of think about the puts and takes of all that, what's our -- I mean how should we be thinking about the second quarter without giving specific guidance, so just kind of reconciling those factors for the upcoming quarter?", "Bret W. Wise", "So let me kind of work through those one at time. Chris may have an insight because he's pretty close to this. But we did a price increase October 1. And as predicted, the dealers bought ahead of that price increase, and we commented on that at that time. Then as we moved through Q4, we could see the dealers were trying to increase their channel inventories ahead of the January 1 price increase. On our fourth quarter call, we commented we thought that happened. But then that was pretty much confirmed through subsequent announcements by the dealers themselves that they had, in fact, had increased inventories pretty substantially ahead of that January 1 price increase. We did see some of that come down in the first quarter, but certainly not all of it. And the recent announcement by one of the major dealers confirmed this as well, that they seem to have worked off about 1/3 of that inventory build in the first quarter. So you're right, that still got to come out. I don't know when it will happen, if it will be second quarter, if it will be over several quarters. But that -- we don't believe those inventory levels will stay that high over a very long period of time. With respect to the comparison, we did have a gangbuster January -- or first quarter 2012 in the U.S. 7.4% internal growth and that comparison does ease as we move through the rest of the year. Chris, I don't know if you have anything to add?", "Christopher T. Clark", "No. Those are the 2 factors. And again, on the channel inventories, they did come down in the quarter, but they still have room to grow yet. So yes, from that angle, I'd view that as a gradual transition, at this point over the next quarter or, frankly, it may be a little bit even in Q3.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up question from Jeff Johnson at Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So Bret, help me reconcile one thing. If I look at your European number, up 0.8%, you had the 2 fewer selling days, you had the German issue. I mean if I ex all that out, I can convince myself maybe 3%, 4%, even 4% or 5% growth in the quarter. Obviously, that doesn't fit with kind of your tone on the European market right now and kind of everything else we've been hearing on Europe. So I don't want to get too positive on the next few quarters, but it also seems like the numbers, optically, were definitely better. And how do I reconcile all that?", "Bret W. Wise", "Well, I think there's a number of factors there. One is that -- and this number is about a full point lower than we've been running. There are 2 fewer selling days offsetting that. We did have the largest dental show in the world in Europe in the first quarter. So I mean -- and that does generally boost growth, not so much in equipment but it's certainly not negative to equipment. So you should take those comments -- with reason -- the way to reconcile this is we look country-by-country in Europe right now. We see those markets as being -- some of those markets, not all -- from being slightly softer than they were, let's say, 6 months ago or 1 year ago. And I wouldn't take our number and just add 2% or 3% to it for the selling days because there's more factors there, including the trade shows, to consider.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the channel inventory, just a follow-up from the last question. I mean, is your look at channel inventory just a comment Schein made on their call a couple of days ago? Or do you have more of a direct line insight there? Because I think some of their inventory's remaining high on the equipment side, not necessarily the consumables that would impact you. So I'm assuming there's something more than just their public comments that have you kind of talking about that?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes. Jeff, we monitor that pretty closely. Obviously, we know we sell to them and we get their sellout data, so that enables us to monitor that pretty carefully and it gets beyond just Schein.", "Operator", "And Mr. Leckow, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Derek W. Leckow", "Well, thank you, everyone for joining us today, and that concludes our conference call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Derek W. Leckow", "Thank you, Richele. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International's second quarter 2013 results. Joining me today are Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, President and CFO; and Jim Mosch, Executive Vice President and COO. We realize there are a number of other earnings reports this morning, so in the interest of time, we'll keep our prepared comments brief. I hope you had a chance to review our press release issued this morning. A copy of the release and the set of slides to accompany this call are also available for download on our website, www.dentsply.com.", "I'd like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language and the U.S. GAAP reconciliation contained in today's press release also pertain to this conference call. Certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements, as described on Page 1 of the company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the events or circumstances that may arise after the day of this call.", "With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bret Wise. Bret?", "Bret W. Wise", "Yes. Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter call this morning. I have some brief comments on the market and our results, and then I'm going to turn it over to Jim and Chris for more in-depth discussion of the results.", "First, starting with the market. Overall, in Q2, we saw the global market is relatively stable versus what we saw late last year and also in the first quarter this year. U.S. continues to be a growth market, where we are seeing reasonable volume growth at this point. Europe is essentially flat, as we've seen for some time now, and the Rest of World varies, with the emerging market regions really growing nicely and the developed regions in a low-growth stage at this point. So overall, maybe a slight improvement in the U.S. but no other notable change from what we reported on our first quarter call.", "With respect to our results, we reported 2.5% sales growth, ex PM, for the quarter. This was essentially all internal growth, which came in at 2.7%, and currency was slightly negative. Our internal growth was robust in the U.S., we were up 6.2%; while Europe was positive 1.0%, and that's essentially the same as what we saw in the first quarter; and Rest of World was a positive 0.9%.", "We've seen good uptake on new product introductions in the U.S., and our specialty businesses were particularly strong this quarter, confirming to us that these businesses, which are targeted at high-end procedures, can really grow in a reasonable economic environment.", "I'd emphasize that we don't really view the U.S. economy as strong at present, maybe it's growing 2%, yet our specialty businesses in total notched double-digit growth for the quarter, and that was led by our implant business. In Europe, I think we're seeing more the same, probably a flat market at best, and we continue to grow, although low single digits. In Rest of World, the reported growth was low this quarter due in part to our decision to discontinue sales to a number of dealers in the Middle East due to increased gray market concerns on our part. Absent the Middle East, our Rest of World number would have been up mid single digits.", "On a product category basis, and this is global, our healthcare business and our consumable business both grew mid single digits, while lab and specialty were low single-digits growth for the quarter. And, of course, that was greatly influenced by the slow market in Europe.", "With respect to adjusted earnings, we saw good operating margin expansion this quarter. We were up 60 basis points. Again, that's measured on ex precious metal basis despite -- and that's despite the [indiscernible] in the U.S., which is not in the 2012 baseline.", "We saw gross margins about flat, excluding the medical excise tax, and we got pretty good leverage on SG&A, including synergies from acquisitions. This and the internal growth drove earnings gains of 6.5% for the quarter to $0.66 per share, and again, that's an adjusted EPS number.", "On capital allocation, I'm going to let Chris cover most of this. However, with respect to acquisitions, we do continue to be active evaluating candidates. We had 1 small acquisition and 1 small divestiture in the quarter, and they basically canceled each other out. We continue to look at other properties. However, we're maintaining a disciplined approach in balancing acquisitions with share buybacks and debt reduction goals.", "Looking forward, although we feel pretty good about our operational performance in the second quarter, we're balancing this with continued slow market conditions in Europe and additional currency headwinds we are now going to face in the back half of this year. Accordingly, we're going to narrow our guidance for adjusted earnings per share for the full year to the bottom half of our previous range, or $2.33 to $2.38 per share, which implies earnings growth in the back half of 7% to 12%.", "Now that concludes my remarks. I'd like to now turn the call over to Jim for further discussion of the results. Jim?", "James G. Mosch", "Thank you, Bret. From an operational perspective, I would like to discuss changes to our U.S. dealer base, comment on Rest of World sales and provide an update on the implant business.", "As you may be aware, in 2006, we initiated our U.S. strategic partnership program, in which we consolidated our U.S. dealer base, and within the associated terms of the agreement, we received detailed end user data from the strategic dealer growth. We have found the end user data to be highly effective in developing marketing and promotional programs, directing sales activities and monitoring retail versus wholesale performance. Over time, the dealer base is consolidated, leaving us with a fairly concentrated dealer presence in some regions due to both market consolidation and also as a result of our termination of 1 dealer agreement at the beginning of the second quarter. In Q2, we added a net 5 U.S. dealers to the program to support market and customer coverage requirements. This action restores the number of dealers and balances the coverage to a level we've had when we initiated the program in 2006. In the quarter, we did receive stocking orders from the new dealers, but this was more than offset by the impact of the dealer termination, so it was a slight negative to U.S. growth in the quarter. Going forward, of course, we would expect the expansion to add growth over time as these new dealers become effective.", "As Bret mentioned, our Rest of World growth slowed in Q2 to 0.9% versus prior year. As we have discussed on these calls before, on an ongoing basis, we monitor potential gray market activities, which are generally more prevalent in the Rest of World regions. In Q2, we completed an in-depth assessment and identified some questionable dealer activities. As there were circumstances where we could not validate the end user sales, we chose to discontinue sales to certain dealers in the region. The majority of these dealers were in the MEA region, which affects Rest of World sales. While there was an immediate effect in Q2, our experience is that demand remains over time if sales are recovered by the dealers. Beyond the challenges of MEA in this category, we saw good growth in Latin America, CIS, Asia-Pacific and Canada, with slower growth in Japan and Australia.", "Turning to the implant segment. DENTSPLY implant saw sales for Q2 only slightly negative on a constant currency basis, which we believe is at or above market. Regionally, we saw U.S. with double-digit growth, clearly above market. As you may remember, the U.S. was our first location to go live in the Astra Tech integration, and we are now capitalizing on the attributes and synergies of the combined implant business.", "Europe was down low to mid single digits, driven heavily by continued declines in Southern Europe and lower growth rates in the rest of Europe.", "As reported in our last -- in last quarter, our German business performed negatively to prior year in Q1, driven by the go live of the full integration of our German business. They made good progress in Q2 on integration activities with respect to operational consolidation, sales effectiveness and customer transition and improved sequentially over Q1, although still negative. We are pleased with the solid sequential improvement, and we believe we are on the right track, as sales force confidence and execution improves.", "Also, in Q2, our Japan business went live as we fully integrated the DENTSPLY implant organization. Japan was our last location to go live, and while the overall organization's effectiveness continues to improve, DENTSPLY implant is essentially moving to a business-as-usual state. From a high level, we are pleased with the progress of the implant business initiatives and that our DENTSPLY implant strategy is sound and will deliver success in the market.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Chris for some additional financial comments. Chris?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to elaborate on our second quarter performance by reviewing key elements of our income statement and also provide some additional color on our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter.", "Our sales growth, excluding precious metals, of 2.5% and our non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 6.5% for the period reflect some volume improvements in our U.S. businesses, increased leverage on our operating model and also the impact of synergy benefits. Our internal growth rate of 2.7% for the quarter was negatively impacted by about 60 basis points as a result of the discontinuation of sales to certain dealers in the Middle East. Currency translation was negative 20 basis points or essentially neutral to sales growth for the quarter.", "Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the second quarter was 58.4% of sales, excluding precious metals, which was a 20-basis-point improvement sequentially from the first quarter and 60 basis points below the strong prior year comparison of 59.0%. We estimate that the medical device excise tax in the United States has negatively impacted gross margins by 40 to 50 basis points in the period compared to prior year. So I'm pleased overall with this performance, which is actually above our trailing 4-quarter average despite not having the tax impact in the half -- over half that baseline.", "SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were $280.3 million or 39.2% of sales, excluding precious metals. That's down 6/10 of 1% compared to the prior year and also down about a full percentage point on a sequential basis compared to Q1.", "Expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals, were down 120 basis points compared to prior year. While we believe we still have some room for further improvement, we're pleased to see some leverage and synergies across our businesses, including from our ongoing integration efforts.", "Operating margin for the quarter was 19.2% of sales, excluding precious metals, on an adjusted basis compared to 18.6% in the second quarter last year, reflecting the SG&A and gross margin impacts I just described. We're pleased to report the 60-basis-point improvement in our operating margin. I would point out that this is, in fact, our strongest quarterly operating margin rate in the past 10 quarters.", "Our reported tax rate for the second quarter was 20.9%, while our operating tax rate was 22.0%, which is consistent with our expectations for the year.", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as reported basis in the second quarter was $87.2 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to $80.8 million or $0.56 per diluted share in the second quarter 2012. These results include a number of items, which we have listed in the schedules in the release.", "On an adjusted basis, earnings were $95.8 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared to $88.5 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the second quarter 2012.", "Let me make an additional comment on currency exchange before I move on to cash flow and the balance sheet. Currency rates had a minimal impact on the P&L in the quarter, impacting sales, excluding precious metals, by negative 20 basis points and creating only a very slight headwind in earnings for the period. As we look ahead, based on the current exchange rates, we now believe the currency headwind for the earning -- on earnings for the back half of the year is about $0.04 per share or between $0.05 and $0.06 negative per share for the year -- for the full year. This is about $0.02 per share worse than what we were looking at on our previous call, with the change being primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar compared to a basket of Asia-Pacific and Latin American currencies.", "Moving on to cash flow. Our operating cash flow in the quarter was $97 million, up nicely from $85 million in last year's second quarter. That brings our year-to-date operating cash flow to $132 million or 28% increase from the prior year period, despite some investments in working capital during the period.", "Inventory now stands at 116 days, which is up 5 days compared to prior year and up 6 days from the end of March, and we've strategically increased inventory as part of transition plans associated with anticipated operational changes in several businesses. We anticipate that inventory may continue to increase slightly for a couple more quarters to support these efforts and then will return in more normal levels as we move through 2014.", "Account receivable days were 59 days at the end of June, up 4 days compared to prior year and flat with the level at the end of Q1.", "Capital expenditures were $22 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total level -- year-to-date level to $46 million. At this point, we believe our capital spending will be in the $100 million range for the year.", "Depreciation in the quarter was $21.3 million, while amortization was $11 million.", "Looking at capital deployment. We continue to have a balanced approach that includes internal investments, returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, acquisitions and also debt reduction. In the second quarter, we returned $71 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which is about 4.5x the prior year level of $15.8 million. We repurchased 1.5 million shares during the second quarter in an average cost of $41.77 per share but still have approximately 13 million shares available for repurchase based on the company's authorization to maintain up to 34 million shares of treasury stock.", "We're also pursuing opportunities on the M&A front, and we're continuing to dialogue and actively engage on specific business opportunities. As Bret mentioned, thus far this year, we competed 1 small acquisition, 1 small divesture, but I would not be surprised to see more acquisitions as we move through the year.", "Finally, As Bret stated, our 2013 earnings per share guidance is $2.33 to $2.38 on an adjusted basis, reflecting our assessment of continued above-market performance but also the impacts of additional currency headwinds, continued high dealer inventories and a softer dental implant market in Europe. This guidance reflects a 3.5% adjusted earnings growth in the first half and implies earnings growth acceleration in the range of -- to the range of 7% to 12% for the second half of the year.", "That completes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your support, and we'd now be glad to take any questions that you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question, we'll hear from Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So Bret, I want to start with you, just on your assessment of Europe and kind of maybe looking for a little more color there. You talked about the market being pretty stable sequentially. It looks like to me, if I just, for selling days, your growth may have come down 100, 150 basis points sequentially or at least softened 100, 150 basis points. So what gives you the confidence market is stable? And if you could provide any more color on maybe how you think some of the southern European countries versus the core European countries could play out over the next couple of quarters, that would be helpful.", "Bret W. Wise", "Okay. I'll give that a shot. As far as our assessment of the market, it's based on both our own sales volume and then anecdotal comments from the 10 or 12 people we got in the different regions of Europe running those businesses. We haven't seen a notable change in the market environment, our customer acquisition activity, their buying activities. There's still good uptake on new product introductions, but overall, that market is not growing. In fact, the economy is probably contracting, and the market is perhaps stable, maybe some volume growth in some countries, but that's offset by lower volume in other countries. So overall, we haven't seen a notable change to comment on for the most part. As far as regionally, I think that what we said before, it's still contracting in the South, but I would say we're seeing a little bit of stabilization there. It seems to be bottoming out in southern Europe, and northern Europe is kind of a balance between some markets that are growing slightly and some markets that are contracting slightly. So we have a little bit optimism that maybe by '14, some of the markets can begin to grow again, but we don't really anticipate a large improvement at this point in the back half of the year. And I think probably, entering the year, we had some hope that we would see some improvement in the back half. I don't know, Chris or Jim, do you have anything to add to that?", "Christopher T. Clark", "No, I think that's pretty clear.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And Bret, the mid single-digit decline on the dental implant business in Europe is -- you feel like that's kind of in line with market. Is there anything you can do to maybe try to get above market at this point over the next few quarters? Or should we be thinking kind of that mid single-digit decline continues for the next couple?", "Bret W. Wise", "Well, I think the mid single-digit decline, and Jim may have something to add to this, is in part due to that German integration. And although we saw a notable improvement in our performance in Q2 versus Q1, I think Jim pointed out, it's still negative. I don't know, Jim, do you have anything to add on the European implant business?", "James G. Mosch", "Yes, Jeff. I think from our standpoint, we definitely see a situation where our German business continues to improve. France, as an overall market, is doing well. U.K. is doing well. And I think we're seeing some stabilization even in Iberia. Italy tends to still be a little bit challenging. But I think, overall, we're seeing a stabilization, and we do expect some improvement at least from our business perspective in those region -- in that region.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "That's helpful. And last question for me, Chris. Just on the Rest of World and the dealers, if you lost about 300 to 500 basis points, it seems like -- as you chose to discontinue some of those EMEA or the MEA dealers, was there an EPS impact from that? Does that flow through to the rest of the year? It looks like to me maybe a couple of pennies. I didn't hear you talk about it when you talked about the reasons for trimming the top end of the guidance range, but to me, it had to have been a $0.01 or $0.02 in your guidance if that's going to continue. So just trying to figure that out.", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes, I would -- I guess I would say, Jeff, certainly had an impact in the second quarter. And as we move forward, we do think we'll get a chunk of that business back through other distributors, and some of it, we obviously believe was gray. So we're going to get some of that back in the developed countries, if you will. But that will take -- sometimes, it takes a little bit of time. So yes, there is certainly a little bit of a headwind built in.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Any way to quantify that? Was it $0.01 this quarter, a couple of pennies for the year? Anything?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes, you're in the right range. Yes.", "Operator", "And next, we'll move on Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you talk or elaborate -- sorry, this is Erin Wilson in for Robert Willoughby. But could you elaborate on the, I guess, trends in the U.S. and how sustainable they are? And this is sort of a run rate, I guess, excluding any sort of changes in selling days and such.", "Bret W. Wise", "Sure, Erin. I'll take a stab at that. I think our performance in the second quarter was really very strong in the U.S. I mean, it's obvious, I don't think the U.S. market is growing 6%, and we had very strong performance in the specialties, in particular, but also in the consumable business was -- had pretty good growth as well. Whether 6% growth is sustainable over a long period of time or not, I'm not sure. I think that would require the market itself to tick up a little bit from where it is today. But our businesses are executing pretty well, and we're pleased with the uptake we're getting on new products in this market. There's volume growth in this market, which we haven't seen for some period of time. And some of the indicators we follow like white-collar employment gains have been pretty steady here for a while, and I think that's helpful to a business like ours.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then is the integration in Japan, I know you highlighted it in your prepared remarks, but is that going smoothly as initially anticipated?", "James G. Mosch", "Yes, absolutely. One of our -- we initially integrated the operational portion of this business, with the consolidation of the 2 businesses to 1 facility. That actually happened in the beginning of June. And then the sales force integration happened at the end of June, and that's gone very well. We're very pleased with the way that has occurred.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And do you have any idea when you can kind of, I guess, regain some of the lost sales due to the gray market distributor in the Middle East?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes, Erin, it's Chris. That's going to be gradual. Again, we have other distributors in those regions. We would expect them to pick up obviously a chunk of that initially, but that will probably increase gradually over time. In addition to that, any time we shut off a gray market source, then obviously, that's less product that is getting kind of around our normal distribution channels into the developed markets. So we'd anticipate a gradual increase or a slow impact there as well. I think, again, we'll see it over time. I don't know that it -- it certainly doesn't snap back in a month or necessarily fully in a quarter, but it certainly should come back over time.", "Operator", "And next, we'll hear from Jon Block with Stifel.", "Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Bret, the U.S. specialty market was a really big number, and it seems like it was led by your implant division. Can you talk to the mix shift that you're witnessing in the U.S. dental implant market versus that of what's going on in Europe? And, I guess, in other words, as the delta between the double digit in the U.S. and down mid single digits in Europe, is that all a function of market growth or you're seeing a negative mix shift to lower-end solutions maybe more pronounced in Europe versus what's going on in the U.S.?", "James G. Mosch", "Yes, John, this is Jim Mosch. From a standpoint of the U.S. market, I mean, clearly, one of the things that we're seeing in the implant business is how the implant business reacts when the economy improves a little bit. And so, obviously, some of the growth we're seeing is an improved market. However, we absolutely believe that as we've consolidated this organization, it's become more productive and more effective that we are seizing customers and we are growing in this market and we are gaining market share. We definitely believe double-digit growth in North America is an increase in market share in the second quarter. As it relates to Europe, we have definitely had some regions that are under duress and have been for a considerable period of time. So we recognize that implants are not an investment that patients are making. We do not see a huge shift from premium to value. And I think one of the things that we always look at is that we do not see a situation in the marketplace where the cost of treatment to the patient is going down, which we think would be a real driver to that change. We definitely recognize that the value implants are out there. They tend to be local. We know they do a lot of swap between each other, and we monitor that closely. But in the premium segment, we do not see major moves to value in our customer group or -- and then, certainly, our largest customers.", "Christopher T. Clark", "John, it's Chris. I might add that I think the U.S. number kind of underscores that in a reasonable economy. That implant segment really should be accretive and will be accretive to the dental market growth rate. And certainly, what we're seeing in the U.S. and then, obviously, as economic conditions over time improve, I think that has us obviously feeling better in terms of the implant market globally. I would also add, as Jim mentioned, that the U.S. market was the first market that we integrated. So, again, as these integrations go on with time, we get more and more positive momentum, at least that's what we've seen, and obviously, we're pleased with the momentum we have in the U.S., as Jim mentioned.", "Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. And it actually sort of plays into the next question, which is, how did Japan go on folding together the sales forces? You mentioned a little disruption in Germany last quarter. I guess, did you witness some disruption in Japan? Or was it seamless? And then when we think about Japan being the last market to consolidate in terms of Astra Tech, what should we think about the incremental savings from here? In other words, are there still some things that you can pull down on as we exit '13 and go into '14?", "James G. Mosch", "Yes. From a standpoint of the integration in Japan, it went very well. I mean, obviously, you get better over time with experience. The other thing is the Japan business was not nearly the size of, say, Germany or the U.S. So our ability to integrate that seamlessly was very effective. We had a lot of time for those 2 organizations to work together, to get to know each other, to coordinate. And that process, from our perspective, went very, very well, not only from a sales force perspective but also from integration of business systems and things of that nature. So that's gone very well. As far as going forward, certainly, from a standpoint, we recognize synergies from the consolidations that we did. We continue to look for operational synergies as well. And on an going basis, I think there is an element where, as you go through an integration, you have a plan, you execute that plan, you recognize the synergies and then you step back and you take a look at your organization and you say, \"Is this aligned with the way I see the business progressing, those strategy that I have in place and you continue to evaluate that?\" So from a business perspective, this is an ongoing process for us.", "Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And one more if I can just slip it in. Chris, this one for you, just cash flow-related. It looks like CapEx, I think the range used to be $120 million plus. I think you said closer to $100 million this year. Is that just something from a timing perspective of '13 versus '14 or anything that you're pulling back on from a CapEx standpoint?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes, John, it's pretty much just a timing standpoint in terms of we got some initiatives in place, and we really haven't changed the scope of those initiatives but the timing a little bit in terms of phasing on a couple of them.", "Operator", "And next, we'll move to Matt Pascoe [ph] with William Blair.", "Unknown Analyst", "I know, obviously, you talked about, in aggregate, Europe is -- continues to be weak, but are there any specific products that you guys see that are surprising you?", "Bret W. Wise", "Well, I would characterize the market in Europe, the consumable market there, meaning the everyday dentistry products, is better than the specialty businesses, which are highly discretionary and a lot of times not reimbursed. So I would say the preventive products and the restorative products are both doing better. We've had some nice product launches there with -- I mean, I'll just throw out some names here, Prime&Bond Elect, the new cement we have; SmartLite, which is a new light we have; TPH Spectra is a new composite we're putting on the market; Protaper NEXT is a new endodontics file. We're getting good uptake in a lot of these newer products, and -- so that everyday dentistry segment is much more stable than the specialty side of the business, I would say, in Europe.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll move to Yi-Dan Wang with Deutsche Bank.", "Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "First of all, on the dental implant business in Germany, is that a recovery more or less in line with what you were expecting? Or is it progressing a bit slower than expected? Certainly, coming out to the last call, I was expecting it to improve or to start to grow in the second quarter. If you could comment on that, and also when you would expect that business to return to growth, that will be helpful. And then secondly, was the implant business affected by the disruptions that you talked about in the gray market in the Middle East? And then, thirdly, can you give us the sort of sales day adjusted growth for the U.S. and ex U.S. implant business? And yes, that will be helpful. That's all.", "Bret W. Wise", "Okay. Let me take a couple of these, and then I'll let Jim comment on the German business and the progression of the integration. With respect to the Middle East disruption, that was not implants, that was basic consumable products. Sales adjusted basis, we don't adjust our sales for the days, but if you want to adjust them yourself, you can. I think there was an extra day in the U.S., an extra day in Germany. We were down a day in Sweden. Overall...", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes. About 60% of our business had an extra day.", "Bret W. Wise", "Okay. So about 0.6 of a day for the global business was extra this quarter versus last year. With respect to the implant business in Germany and progression of the integration, Jim, do you want to take that?", "James G. Mosch", "Absolutely, Bret. From a standpoint of the integration in Germany, I think it's important to recognize that this was, by far, our largest and most complex integration. This is a very large sales force, fairly equally divided between Astra Tech and Friadent organizations. So there was a fair amount of customer transition. They're also moving to a common operating system, common processes, and there's just an element of the business gains confidence and effectiveness over time. We certainly would have hoped that the integration would have gone smoother in the first quarter. We saw a nice improvement in Q2, and we've seen improvement in July. So from my perspective, I see the confidence and effectiveness of this organization improve every month, and we expect it to continue to perform better each month as we go forward. As far as the overall market, the German market is probably, I think, a little bit more challenging than us and our competitors would have anticipated. So that recovery aspect is happening in a market that probably has a little bit of slower growth as well. But I think, over time, as we move through the next couple of quarters, we expect to see some good improvement in that market and that business.", "Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "When you say improvements in the next couple of quarters, can we expect it to grow by that time or it's kind of a relative gain in that if the market is becoming more challenging, then you're going against decent headwinds?", "Bret W. Wise", "Yes, Yi-Dan, we don't really give specific guidance on specific products in specific markets, but we're happy to see that the business is improving sequentially. We expect that to continue. Predicting how 1 market in 1 country around the world is going to progress is a dangerous business, and we don't believe we need to do that. But we're happy with the business. It's progressed nicely from what happened in the first quarter, and we expect to see sequential improvement from here.", "Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then last question. On the regional growth in the implant business, can you be a bit more precise on your U.S. and ex U.S. growth? I mean, double digit sounds wonderful. Can you give us some indication on where you are along those lines, whether it's low double-digit, mid-teens, high-teens, and then similarly for the ex U.S. business?", "Bret W. Wise", "It's low double digits in the U.S., and it's negative in Europe.", "Operator", "And we'll move on to Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Bret, curious if you would elaborate on what drove the decision to change the dealer setup in the U.S. market, and if you could quantify the impact to the U.S. growth rate in the second quarter. And then how should we think about that dynamic in the back half of the year?", "Bret W. Wise", "Okay, Bran, I'll take a stab at this and then if Jim or Chris want to add anything they can. When we -- right after we had done the dealer consolidation, it was late 2006, 2007. We had basically 22 dealers that were strategically picked for coverage in the market and also the way that they transact business with us, meaning they were the most sophisticated and the easiest business partners for us to do business with. They were very efficient, et cetera. Since that time, there has been consolidation of 5 of those dealers. So about 25% of the baseline went away through consolidation, and then in the second quarter -- early in the second quarter, we terminated one of the remaining. It was 17 dealers at that point, so we were down to 16 dealers. We felt that was a little bit too consolidated, so we made the decision to go back out and find 5 or 6 other dealers that we thought would rebalance the portfolio and get us back to kind of a number around 20, 22 dealers to cover all of the U.S., which we think is about the right balance for us. So just -- we expect that there can be industry consolidation, so when we consolidated -- when we brought the dealer -- the number of dealers down before, we knew this might happen. And over the 6 or 7 years since we implemented the program, we had lost 25% of the dealers to consolidation, so we rebalanced the portfolio. This is simply what happened. The effect on the second quarter was that the initial orders from the new dealers to bring their -- put their inventory in was slightly less than the sales we lost to the dealer we cut off. So it was slightly negative to the U.S. growth rate in the quarter. As those dealers become now efficient in areas of the market that maybe we were underrepresented in before, we expect it, of course, to be positive to the balance of the business and the growth of the business.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Got you. And then, Chris, any chance you could quantify the impact of absorption on the gross margin line in the second quarter? And certainly, it sounds like that should trend favorably in the back half of the year as you build inventories. And then, perhaps, if you could call out the impact of mix and currency on the gross margin line in the quarter, that would be helpful.", "Christopher T. Clark", "Sure. Let me start with -- the currency really didn't have much of an impact in the quarter. There's some gives and takes between translation and transaction. From a mix standpoint, mix was slightly negative, with obviously a little bit slower implant growth and also a little bit negative product mix. I would characterize that probably in the -- it was -- appear to be in the -- about the 30-basis-point range. Again, the biggest negative impact for us -- impact in general for us on the gross profit line was the med device excise tax, which was between 40 and 50 basis points of headwind. In terms of absorption, we got a little bit of a lift in absorption but not significant as necessarily in a quarter. As we move forward, I would assume that the inventory level [indiscernible] come up a bit but probably not come up to the degree as much incrementally as they have here in the first -- in the second quarter, at least that would be our expectation. But I don't necessarily see them coming down as rapidly in the back half as historically we have. So I would characterize it probably that way.", "Bret W. Wise", "Yes. The only thing I might add there, Brandon, is on the currency impact, although it was somewhat neutral in the second quarter, we saw some pretty significant weakening of both emerging markets and some developed markets against the U.S. dollar and the euro. And the reason that's important is, in those markets, we typically buy the inventory in from the U.S. or Europe, and thus, we had a little bit of a headwind -- or more of a headwind than we had when we finished the first quarter with respect to some of those currencies. I don't know, Chris...", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes. Absolutely. I mean, if you look at it in the quarter, against the Australian dollar, the U.S. dollar strengthened 11%, similar movement against the Brazilian real, similar movement against the Indian rupee. I mean, some of these are smaller organizations force, but there's a lot of them that add up. And, again, as Bret mentioned, these folks are net importers of products, both from U.S. and from Europe in terms of our products. And so as such, as their home currencies weaken, those foreign-sourced products become more expensive for them. And so, obviously, their profits obviously translate to fewer U.S. dollars as well.", "Operator", "And next, we'll hear from Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Diego Hernandez", "It's actually Diego filling in for Glen. I was just wondering if we could get a quick update on sort of the ortho relaunch. I think where we left it last quarter, the things were tracking well in line with your expectations. Any color around that would be helpful.", "Bret W. Wise", "Yes. I think we're pretty much -- very much still in line, Diego, relative to what we expected. I would say we kind of characterize it as saying this next phase was going to be a street fight slugging it out, really, customer by customer with competition. I think that ortho Japan together really didn't have a meaningful impact necessarily on our overall growth for the quarter or internal growth for the quarter. We saw some solid customer gains, particularly in the U.S., in the quarter. So we feel good about that. But, again, I think that we're now beginning to run up against kind of the prior year relaunch. We kind of ran up against it in the second quarter in Europe, and now we're going to begin running up against that in the U.S. in terms of some baselines that had customer restocking efforts in it. So -- but, again, the way we're really measuring this is at a customer level in terms of, again, that street fight, and we're pleased with how our teams are doing, particularly in the U.S. right now.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Leckow for any additional or closing remarks.", "Derek W. Leckow", "Well, thank you. Thanks for your interest in DENTSPLY, and thanks for your participation today. That concludes our conference call. If you have any questions, I'm around today for any follow-ups.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Derek W. Leckow", "Thank you, Allen. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY's third quarter 2013 results. I'm here today with Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, President and CFO; and Jim Mosch, Executive Vice President and COO. I hope you had a chance to review our press release issued this morning.

Our comments on this call will focus on results, excluding certain adjustments that provide operational insight, excluding these items. These items are noted on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the release. You will note that our earnings guidance is also presented on adjusted basis. A recording of this call and its entirety will be available on our website. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bret Wise. Bret?", "Bret W. Wise", "Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone. Thanks again for joining us on our call this morning. I had a few overview comments on both the market conditions and then our overall results, and then I'll turn the call over to Jim and Chris for a more in-depth discussion of the results.", "First on the market. We continue to see the overall market is relatively stable versus what we saw late last year and then also early in 2013. The U.S. continues to be a growth market. Europe is flat at best as we've seen for some time now. And the Rest of World varies with the developing regions growing nicely and the developed regions in a low growth stage. So overall, market conditions are generally consistent with what we've reported on our second quarter call.", "With respect to our results, we reported sales growth of 3.4%, x precious metals this quarter. Internal growth and at constant currency growth were both 2.7% and that is the same that we've reported for Q2. And currency in the third quarter was slightly positive, up 70 basis points. Our internal growth was strongest in the U.S. and Rest of World. U.S. was up 4.3% and Rest of World was up 6%. And growth continued to be slow in Europe where we grew 0.3% in the quarter.", "In the U.S. several of our new product launches this year are doing quite well, and we have some interesting projects that will to the market in the next couple of quarters. Jim is going to comment further on this in his remarks. In Europe, this quarter, marks the 15th straight quarter of positive internal growth for us in the region, which is quite remarkable given the economic climate there. Like the U.S., we're getting some help from our new products but essentially no help from economic conditions. And although there's -- we filed the recent news of slightly improved economic conditions in Europe, I'd remind you that dentistry is typically a trailing indicator. So we're not expecting an immediate reaction our markets, but rather dentistry would likely respond in a couple of quarters. Our Rest of World sales, again, were up 4.6% this quarter, which is a nice sequential improvement. Overall, we saw high single-digit growth in the emerging economies and low single-digit growth in overall in the developed regions that we have in that category.", "From a product category perspective, all 4 of our principal product category groups grew in the quarter with the strongest growth rates in medical and the dental specialties.", "With respect to our adjusted earnings, on a 3.4% topline growth, we reported 7.2% operating income growth, reflecting a 60-basis-point improvement in operating margins. On prior calls, we've talked about our emphasis on operating margin expansion this year, both from a gross margin perspective but also from the expense line. We feel like we're making pretty good progress in both these areas and we're pleased that we're now reporting operating margin expansion on a year-to-date basis as well.", "Overall, adjusted EPS improved 11.8% in the quarter, that's over 3x the rate of top line growth, bringing our year-to-date EPS growth to 6.1%.", "Now looking ahead, we're confirming our guidance for the full year at adjusted EPS of $2.33 to $2.38 per share. This, again, is on an adjusted base. A couple of factors that we're watching closely, are dealer channel inventories and new product introductions. On the former, last year, you may recall, we had 2 price increases: October 1, and then again, on January 1 of this year. And due to these dynamics, our dealers held inventories high, going into the end of last year and on our call for Q4 last year, we commented that boost our total sales in the fourth quarter by what we viewed is probably 1%. This year, we're not planning any year price increase, so we expect the dealers will reduce inventories in the fourth quarter following the October 1 price increase this year that we just implemented. So this year, we've probably will see a liquidating dealer inventory channel versus the build that we saw on our fourth quarter last year.", "The second item of importance, I think, is new products. We have a pretty good slate of innovation coming to the market this year, including in the fourth quarter. But that should be a positive element and partially offset the dealer inventory reduction that I just mentioned. Of course, we'll update you on this when we report our full year results in February. And at the same time, we'll provide guidance for 2014. But I'd like to now turn the call over to Jim. He's got a few comments on the implant integration and also the new product portfolio. Jim?", "James G. Mosch", "Thank you, Bret. I'd first like to review our implant business. In Q3, our global implants sales were flat on a constant-currency basis. U.S. was up mid-single digits, Europe was negative, and the Rest of World showed sequential improvement, up mid-single digits. As discussed in our second quarter call, we went live with the consolidated DENTSPLY Friadent and Astra Tech German organizations in Q1 of this year. To date, good process has been made on training, customer transition, as well as consolidation of operating systems, which are now complete. Based on trends, we observed other major markets following integration. We are now at a point where the organization is returning to a normal level of competency and effectiveness, and we expect to return to growth in this important market in 2014.", "From a marketing perspective, in October, DENTSPLY implants Germany held an implant congress in which 400 plus clinicians attended. We're very pleased with the response and results and in particular, the strong interest in our technology-base. It's important to note that we have continued our integration efforts with the implant business as we worked to realize identified synergies. Consistent with our integration plan, we took a small restructuring charge in Q3, and we'll take a second charge in Q4 as part of our ongoing efforts to improve operating performance of the implant business.", "Turning to new products. 2013 has been a good year for launching new innovative brands. Thus far, this year, we have launched a new composite system, TPH Spectra, 2 new fluoride varnish brands, NUPRO varnish and Durashield CV and a new endodontics system ProTaper NEXT, as well as numerous other innovations discussed on previous calls this year. In addition, we have recently launched several additional new products that we believe would be very impactful to the market and will be received well by our customers.", "First in our restorative segment, we have a significant launch, Aquasil Ultra Cordless, this is a novel one-step system for taking impressions in crown or bridge applications, which in most cases, eliminates the need for the use of a retraction cord. Packing the retraction cord is a time-consuming process for the clinician and can be uncomfortable for the patient. Our new system consists of a unique Aquasil-based tissue management and pressure material and a pneumatic delivery device. The device expresses the material through a small cannula that is inserted between the tooth and in gingiva, making the procedure simpler and more patient friendly and eliminates the need for a retraction cord. Aquasil Ultra Cordless reduces the time for a cord placement and impression taking procedure by up to 70%. Impression taking is a large part of the market and we expect this new innovative technique to have a meaningful impact.", "In our preventive segment, we have a number of new product launches. I will highlight 2: The Cavitron Prophy Jet is an updated air polishing unit with tap-on technology that is designed to improve ergonomics by reducing foot pedal usage and adding a prophy mode that autocycles between air polishing and rinse, thereby improving the prophy procedure. Second is the Midwest Automate, a single station for providing automated and consistent maintenance for various hand pieces using in the dental arbitrary [ph]. The automated maintenance station will aid in improving the useful life of dental hand pieces. And although it is not new for the market, it's a new category for the Midwest portfolio, which is one of leading hand piece brands in the market.", "Within our implant group, we launched Simplant 16, a new updated version of the Simplant implant training software with several new features, including the integration of Atlantis WebOrder, customized departments for immediate restoration, and iPad viewer for sharing case planning information with patients. We are one of the leaders in the market in implant planning and customized digital solutions, and this product leverages our market position in brands through an integrated approach.", "Finally, within our endodontics group, we have launched Proglider, a new viable taper rotary glidepath file that can create a glidepath in most cases with only one instrument, compared to 2 to 3 instruments, for traditional technology providing simplicity and speed for endospecialist and general practitioners.", "Overall, 2013 has been a good year for DENTSPLY in regards to new product development and product launches, which is a key growth for overall performance.", "I will now turn the call over to Chris for the financial overview.", "Christopher T. Clark", "Thank you, Jim, good morning, everyone. I'd like to provide some detail on our third quarter results by reviewing key elements of our income statement, and also provide some additional color on our balance sheet and cash flow for the quarter.", "Our sales growth, excluding precious metals of 3.4%, and our non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% for the period reflects some volume improvements in both our U.S. and Rest of World geographic regions, increased leverage in our operating model, and also the impact of synergy benefits. Our growth was largely organic with 2.7% internal growth and currency translation impact of a positive 70 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter.", "Gross profit, on an adjusted basis in the third quarter, was 56.6% of sales excluding precious metals, which was down 30 basis points from the prior year comparison of 56.9%. This was entirely due to the headwinds in the medical device excise tax in the United States and the gross profit rate on an adjusted basis would have been up slightly compared to prior year without this impact.", "SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were $259 million in the quarter were 38.7% of sales excluding precious metals. That's sort of 100-basis-point improvement from last year's 39.7% SG&A rate. On a year-to-date basis, [indiscernible] [indiscernible] are down 90 basis points as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals. And we're pleased with the improved leverage and synergies across our businesses, including the impact of our cost saving efforts in integration activities.", "Operating margin for the quarter improved 60 basis points to 17.9% of sales, excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis, compared to 17.3% in the third quarter last year, reflecting the SG&A and the gross margin impacts that I just described. On a year-to-date basis, operating margin has improved 20 basis points compared to prior year. We're pleased to be delivering operating margin improvement despite the continued muted market conditions in a number of countries. Our reported tax rate for the third quarter was 14.0%, while our operating tax rate was 22.1%, which is consistent with our expectations for the year.", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International, on an as-reported basis in the third quarter, was $79.9 million or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to $53.4 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2012. These results include a number of items that we've listed in the schedules in the release. On an adjusted basis, net earnings grew 12% to $82.2 million or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to $74.1 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2012.", "Moving onto cash flow. Our operating cash flow in the quarter was $126 million, up 31% from $96 million in last year's third quarter. This brings our year-to-date operating cash flow to $258 million or 28% increase from prior year-to-date despite some investments in working capital. Our cash flow performance in the quarter allowed us to reduce debt by an additional $108 million. And our net debt-to-capital ratio now stands at 35.8%, a significant improvement from the 48.2% net-debt-to-cap ratio immediately following the Astra Tech acquisition in September 2011.", "Inventory now stands at 118 days, which is up 7 days compared to September 2012, and up 2 days from the end of June. As we discussed on this call last quarter, we strategically increased inventory in a few businesses as part of transition plans associated with anticipated operating changes. We expect inventory may continue to increase slightly for another quarter or so to support these efforts before returning to more normal levels as we move through 2014 and 2015. Accounts receivable days were 64 days at the end of September. Capital expenditures were $27 million in the quarter, bringing year-to-date level to $74 million, and we continue to believe our capital spending will be in the $100 million range for the year.", "Depreciation in the quarter was $20 million, while amortization was $11 million.", "Looking at capital deployment. Our approach continues to be focused on balance. As we look to support internal investments, return cash to shareholders, share repurchases and dividends, strengthen the company through acquisitions and also continue gradual debt reduction. Year-to-date, DENTSPLY Inc. returned almost $100 million of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased 1.7 million shares during the first 9 months in an average cost of $41.89 per share, but still have approximately 14 million shares available for repurchase based on the company's authorization to maintain up to 34 million shares of treasury stock.", "Finally, as Bret stated, our 2013 earnings per share guidance remains $2.33 and $2.38 on an adjusted basis reflecting our assessment of continued above market performance but also the impact of continued high dealer inventories and ongoing soft market conditions in Europe. That completes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your support and we've now be glad to answer any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Bret, I wonder if you can just start on the dental implant side of the of the business? Wondering, it sounds like some declines there again this quarter. Maybe you could flush out -- and that's common in Europe, obviously. I'm wondering if you could flush out the European market especially what you're seeing in Germany now that the sales force integration is complete there. And Jim, would like to hear maybe what gives you the confidence that dental implant growth turns positive again in 2014 as you talked about in your prepared remarks.", "Bret W. Wise", "Jim, why don't Jim Mosch take all that? You're kind of prepared than I am.", "James G. Mosch", "Absolutely. Thanks, Jeff. I think, obviously, we've continued to see challenges in the European market overall. From the standpoint, the issues in Southern Europe may be while improving slightly, are still negative. And I think we've just seen a general slowness in Europe overall so we've not seen a real change in the European implant market. All indications are that the German implant market is negative. And we think that this to some degree is undermining some of our recovery and our growth. But from the standpoint of our German implant business, the situation that we've seen in the major markets where we've gone through integration, there is this 6- to 9-month period as you go through really -- you're now educating 2 salesforces on each other's implant systems. You have customer transition getting to know new customers, building relationships, familiarity with operating systems. It was just a series of general things that you go through in a transition process. And obviously, we like that to be quicker, but we're also realistic about how much time that takes. And certainly the magnitude in our larger markets. I can say we experienced similar trend in the U.S. market when we went live there. My confidence is that we're really seeing those operating transition issues really come to a close. We held the implant conference in Germany, which was very well attended. We had our organization present as well and we just saw a lot of positive come out of that. So we really see our organization focusing more on customers and the business. We really expect that, that improvement will take through the fourth quarter. And next year, we have certainly have higher expectations.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, great. And just maybe a follow-up on that, Jim. It sounds like U.S. was up mid-single digits, Rest of World up mid-single digits on the implant side. Europe down as you said. Was that -- would that have been down mid-single digits? And maybe sequentially if you could compare last quarter to this quarter? Was it better or worse? And then my only other question would be, in Germany, especially, on the dental implant side, how much of it do you think at this point is macro versus the generics and in clones and those kind of products that are coming into the markets? I guess I'm still trying to figure out Europe, if Europe for the premium guys [ph] can get back to growth anytime soon given the generics in the clones or if that market for the premium players like yourself is just going to stay negative for some time to come?", "James G. Mosch", "Well, I think the issues with the generics and the clones. I think we have to recognize that when you look at the overall size revenue of the implant market, particularly the premium implant market, that's really still the dominant portion of that marketplace. There's no question that the value segment is getting a lot of play right now. This is an area that we continue to watch very closely. And quite frankly, assess, work to assess what impact it is having. But I would say that I think the trends are really going to be predominantly driven by the growth in those markets and by the premium players. And I think we saw some positive signs in Q2, overall. Although I think what causes you to pause is that Q1 was very negative. So as we go into this third quarter, I think it will be very interesting to see, as all the implant companies report, to get a better understanding as to do we actually have a positive trend up? Or is it really kind of continuing? The reality is, through the first half of the year, the market is still negative. So I think this quarter, will be kind of an important indicator to give us an idea of how that market is trending.", "Bret W. Wise", "Yes. The other thing I'd add to that, Jeff, is just qualitatively, what we see today is that in an economy that's growing, the premium implant group does pretty well. We see that in the U.S., we see it in a lot of the Rest of World markets and in an economy that's still flat on its back, or not growing [ph], or maybe only growing slightly, it's a tougher challenge because there's no economic expansion, no discretionary income growth, et cetera.", "Operator", "And so we'll go to Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Bret, could you just elaborate on kind of what we saw in the U.S. in the period? Was there any pre-buying ahead of the price increase this year and can you give us a sense of the magnitude of that price hike?", "Bret W. Wise", "Sure. The pre-buy -- we do have -- an October 1 price increase every year and the products that go through distribution and dealers predictably buy ahead of that price increase to protect their margins as they then liquidate that inventory. I'd say the activity we saw this year ahead of the price increase was comparable to what we've seen in prior years. No major change there. So the change that we called out this morning was that last year, because we had yet another price increase coming January 1, dealers kept their inventories higher, even grew their inventories in the fourth quarter where this year, we think they'll follow the more natural progression of liquidating inventories. Price increases, in total, were comparable to what we've seen in the past. Maybe 1.5%, 2%.", "Christopher T. Clark", "Pretty much in the traditional range, 1.5% to 2%, Brandon.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "And then, Chris, or, Bret, could you just elaborate kind of on where we are from a capital deployment perspective? And what's your priorities kind of are moving forward here? And perhaps, give us an update on how you view the acquisition pipeline.", "Bret W. Wise", "Sure. As we said since the acquisition, we were very much in a debt reduction mode. We've kind of worked our debt to cap down from kind of 50%-ish to maybe 35%-ish year over the last 2 years and the leverage ratio has come down comparably. Such that both are very close now or maybe even in our normal ranges. So as Chris mentioned on the call, and Chris may have something to add to this, our capital deployment now is going to be we think a more balanced approach spread between some still some debt reduction probably, particularly the extent we have excess cash flow and you saw that this quarter we brought that down by over $100 million. Balance with share repurchases, we bought 100 -- 1.7 million shares this year, and then also acquisitions. We don't have anything to report today on acquisitions, but we view ourselves in a fragmented industry and we're a traditional consolidator and we expect to continue to participate in that.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to Jonathan Beake with Citi.", "Jonathan A. Beake - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just 2. Firstly, just if you give us a quick update on the ortho business where you are in terms of market share and where you're hoping to get there. And second, on the implant business just a follow-up to the earlier question. We've seen some of your European competitors or pay for this one sort of ramp up there interest in pursuing a sort of jewel brand strategy. I wondered, I know you guys are already half there, and already have the Phase III DIO, but whether there's any interest in further increasing your exposure to the discount segment?", "James G. Mosch", "Thanks very much. In regards to the ortho business, that business has continued to improve. Obviously, we were very much a recovery mode last year as we exited the market and then came back into the market. Our supplier has done a good job of recovering from a volume perspective. And I believe when we came back into the market, we did see a sizable recovery of customers that occurred immediately. You know those customers that we have strong relationships, we're able to maintain relationships and business through the supply outage. As we've gotten into the market place, obviously, our competitors have been very aggressive. And we've been fighting to recover that next set of customers. We think we've made good progress. We look at it kind of as a third, a third, a third. We recovered probably a third immediately. We continue to fight for the second and third. And obviously, we've got more that we don't[ph] have to go after. We've seen good growth in U.S. As we look at the Rest of World, there is some element of baseline issue in that we are depending on how we rolled out the recovery. We had a lot of stock up with our customers and obviously, some of our dealers in the prior year. So now we're kind of running up against that comparison. But regardless, we are happy with the recovery that we've seen in that business. And we think we could make good progress across several initiatives.", "Christopher T. Clark", "I might add to that, that I do think the market conditions in ortho remain incredibly competitive. I mean, probably as competitive as we've ever seen as the competition that took our customers. So obviously, when we couldn't supply them, we're doing everything we can obviously, to retain those customers as we're now back in the market. So I think we've categorized this thing as a street fight, and I think that, that's very much where we are at this stage.", "Bret W. Wise", "Jonathan, I'll take the value implant question. With respect to value implant and dual branding, I'd say DENTSPLY is probably the king of dual branding in the dental markets. Although and usually in these high-end businesses or the very technique-sensitive businesses, if you're going to do a brand, you need to do it through a separate channel. And so we're watching very closely what's being done in this market and we have a few concerns about what the profitability of some of these companies are. We've seen a few come up for sale and they weren't real positive. So the question is, can you do a brand, a value impact without the customer support that the premium [indiscernible] companies offer? And I would say our customers are increasingly demanding on new innovation and customer support, including a direct salesforce, including the symposiums, opinion leaders, support, et cetera. So there are still some questions about that business model. Now about 3 years ago at this time, we made an investment in our value implant company in South Korea, so we're participating in the market through that investment. Today, it's not entirely clear how the market's going to shake out, but we're prepared to participate depending upon what the ending dynamics of this -- of the markets are value versus premium. And typically, those will bifurcate in dental markets and we've seen that in other dental markets around the world.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Erin Wilson of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you give us an update on the impact of the exclusion of the gray market distributor in Rest of the World? And have you been able to recover some of those sales?", "James G. Mosch", "Yes, absolutely. As mentioned in our last call, we identified some gray market activity in our kind of Central, Eastern Europe, Middle East to Africa area. We did take some action, and obviously, that did have an impact on our Rest of World sales, primarily due to that market. We've engaged in a very diligent process as it relates to how we evaluate new distributors. We put that process in place. It is rigorous. I think it really helps us to identify the quality capabilities over those dealers and also, as well as business practices. And so we've continued to add dealers and we saw a nice improvement in that area in the third quarter. Those new dealer additions have had an impact. I think they've added quality to our business. And we feel that, that business is recovering to a more normal conditions.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And can you speak to the underlying demand trends in the U.S. from a volume perspective? I know you kind of touched on this earlier, but also, just given the changes in the dealer inventory, how should we think about kind of the quarterly progression of our organic growth trends?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Erin it's Chris. Relative to volume, I think that as we look at look forwards in terms of internal growth in the U.S., there is some volume in that based on our analysis. And I think that's encouraging, certainly from our perspective. As Bret mentioned, in terms of inventories, inventories again, with the price increase October 1, so dealers bought in an advanced to that. Pretty typical in terms of levels, I would say. And I think that the factor that we've really got as we look to Q4, is that we're going against the base period where not only did they buy in advance in Q4 last year, but they kept inventories high, and in some cases, added to that in advance of the January 1st price increase, which again, based on really kind of the unfavorable comparison we're going to be running up against. So we're -- we've got a period come up here in Q4 that we're going to -- we anticipate dealer inventories in U.S. to liquidate. And going up against the period in the prior year, where they were high and actually increased.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And just one quick one, and broadly speaking here from a capital deployment standpoint, if you are truly in a more of an acquisition mode 5 years down the road, what businesses really make sense for you? What do you expect as far as businesses or geographies? Do you expect to emphasize or deemphasize going forward?", "Bret W. Wise", "Erin this is a Bret. That's a really tough question, particularly looking that far out because there's -- we're such a fragmented industry, and sometimes acquisitions are opportunistic. Meaning, you need a willing seller in order to transact. But I'd say that generally speaking, we're looking for technologies first. Meaning, some technology that would supplement our exiting portfolio in one of our 6 verticals. And now 7 verticals, including the medical group that we have. Second of all, we'd be looking for strong brands in markets where we have somewhat weak presence. And third, we'd be looking for distribution or increasing our channel activity. And in priority, it's probably in that order. But it's hard to predict which of the 7 verticals that would be transacting in over the next 5 years. It will be a little bit somewhat opportunistic in that regard.", "Operator", "The next question from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.", "Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just looking at SG&A and trying to get a better sense on how should we be thinking about the spending going forward. Bret you mentioned operating margin expansion being a big focus. And you guys clearly have done a nice job managing spend this year even if sales have started to come back. I'm just wondering if maybe you could walk a little bit more to the pushes and pulls on the SG&A line as we move forward. Specifically, I guess, trying to get a sense of how we should be thinking about synergies from Astra Tech against you mentioned new product launches. Any expenses that we should be considering as we enter into the new product launch cycle?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Sure. Robert, it's Chris, I'll take a shot at that. As we look at the SG&A rate, obviously, we've been -- we're very pleased with the leverage we've gotten here at the last couple of quarters. And year-to-date, obviously, we're down, as I mentioned, 90 basis points as a percentage of sales. And I think that does reflect certainly the focused effort on the integration activities. And we would anticipate that continuing. But it also reflects that on our base businesses, we're really focused on driving cost savings as well. I would say, with respect to new products, we generally focus heavily as you know, on new products and as such, I think there's a fair amount of new product expenses, if you will, that's not only in our current P&L but also from prior year base. But I think that's really pretty steady for us if you look at it really across our portfolio businesses over time. So I wouldn't really anticipate necessarily a significant bubble there. I would say that as we look at -- we've got a headwind, as you know, in this year in 2013 related on the gross profit line related to medical device excise tax. And I would anticipate, as we move forward into 2014 and we annualize that impact, that the balance of the operating margin improvement may be a little bit more balanced, if you will, between gross profit and in SG&A moving forward. So I think right now, obviously, with the headwinds on MD and then medical device tax, we've been really focused on the operating expense side. And again, I think that as we move forward, we'll probably be a little bit more balanced on that.", "Bret W. Wise", "The only thing I'd add to that, Robert, is that you'll see us take these smaller restructuring charges from time to time, we took 1 here in the third quarter. That's us going after the fixed cost structure to try to improve the efficiency, both within our verticals and then across verticals, as well because sometimes there's synergies there as well.", "Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That makes sense. I know you guys both just mentioned the new product launches and I know, obviously, this is just part of the business model. But I guess I'm just trying to get a gauge as we head into 2014, as far as this launch cycle goes relative to prior years or relative to a typical year, any sense you can give us as far as are there more products coming into the market in this upcoming year and maybe anything around mix is how we should be thinking about the impact in the top line for your new schedule of launches? That would be helpful.", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes, again, it's Chris. I'll take -- if you look at new products, I mean, we introduced in the north of 30 new products a year. And again, we really focus hard on ensuring that across to our verticals, if you will, that we've got a pretty consistent pipeline, if you will, of new products coming over time. And so for that and again, I guess I would just kind of characterize it as not really a single event or a single bubble, but really more of an ongoing process. So I really don't know that I'd say I see a necessarily significant change either up or down, either in terms of necessarily impact or for that matter, aggregate spend. Relative to mix, our new products do obviously help drive our sales mix. And in general, when we bring differentiated technology to market, that typically can help the gross margin mix. And so from that angle, I think that, that's usually accretive to us, or certainly helpful to us over time. There may be some initial launch cost that may bring that down a little bit, but certainly, our -- the newness of our portfolio helps us to differentiate in the drive price.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to John Kreger with William Blair.", "John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Jim, a quick follow-up on the ortho market. On a unit basis, do you think the market is growing at this point? Or flat?", "James G. Mosch", "I would anticipate that it's flat.", "John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "You think it's flat. Okay.", "Bret W. Wise", "I think it's likely, just to add to that, I think it varies by region. Certainly, U.S. could be a growing market for volume, but Europe is probably not at this point. So on balance, it's probably flat or maybe slightly up. But very, as Chris mentioned earlier and Jim said also, it's a very competitive market at this point.", "James G. Mosch", "There's no question, we're an economically driven market. So as we see lack of a robust economy, it is an elective procedure, so we won't see the growth. So I think overall, we have some reasons that are showing a little signs of hope. But overall, I think it still remains pretty flat.", "John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Bret, I'm sure you're still in your planning mode for next year. But any initial thoughts do you think you can be up in the double-digit earnings growth mode?", "Bret W. Wise", "We are early -- as you noted, we're early in the planning stage. I'd rather defer that discussion until we come back on our fourth quarter call as we normally do. We'll give you guidance at that point. So I guess it's too early to send signals on that at this point.", "John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "And then maybe one last one. Where do you stand on the Astra integration at this point? And what should we assume will be coming up in '14 on that front?", "James G. Mosch", "Actually, we -- I would say for all intents and purposes, we are complete. We had our last Go Live in Japan in June. That was our last major market. We did France and Germany at the beginning of the year. So we've really completed that integration for really all of our operating units around the world. However, obviously, we have multi-year integration plan. And as I mentioned in my comments, I mean, we continue to work to realize the identified synergies. And we worked toward that plan. And I think as we are right now, I think that's kind of consistent with what we had expected. So I think the major efforts will our ability to continue to execute that integration plan and realize the synergies.", "John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "So Jim, is the manufacturing consolidation done?", "James G. Mosch", "That was not identified and that's not part of the process. What we have done, to be clear on that, is that we have insourced some products that were outsourced previously. We've insourced in that into our manufacturing operation in Germany. And that was also part of the integration plan.", "Christopher T. Clark", "And this is Chris. I guess I'd add that, that John that's a multi-year effort. And again, I think that, that's we'll be getting some benefits on earlier this year. Benefits in 2014 will be even larger, and 2015 will be even larger than that.", "Bret W. Wise", "But sales, I think where Jim was going on earlier in his comments were was that the sales and marketing [indiscernible] which to us is the most difficult part is now complete. And just like in all of our businesses, we're focusing on efficiencies across the platforms and cost savings. So that's ongoing.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "One clarification on currency, just a housekeeping question. Would you give us an update on your estimate of the impact of currency changes year-on-year embedded in the earnings outlook for '13?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes. I can do that, Steve. As we look at it, we think at this point, based on current rates, we're expecting a negative impact for the year between $0.04 and $0.05. That's about a $0.01 improvement versus what we had coming into the third quarter. By the way, at third quarter, we had negative impact of about a $0.01. And it reflects a positive Euro comparison as the Euro has moved here. But also negative impacts, if you will, in emerging market countries and also developed countries outside of Europe, as well as less favorable impact from our cash flow hedges compared to last year.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then one on pricing specific to the U.S. I wonder if you could give us a sense for -- as you think back to the pricing strategy that you and the rest of the market took coming into this year. How much of that pricing would you estimate has stuck? How much is that contributing to market growth in the U.S.? And considering that we've probably picked up that there's some price inelasticity in the market, then why not be a little bit more assertive on pricing into '14?", "Christopher T. Clark", "It's Chris. Again, our typical price increase is in the 1.5% to 2% range. We were a bit north of that this year between the October 1 price increase last year, as well as the January 1 price increase this year. We think if I had to put a range to it, probably on average, maybe a point north of historical norms on average. And we think the bulk of that have stuck. We don't think necessarily all that has stuck. And then again, we highlighted a few of the pretty competitive markets, orthodontics being one that obviously becomes a little bit more challenging. That said, I think that for us, we do think price is a important variable along with innovation and a lot of other things that drive our leverage and drive our earnings. And again, that's something that we'll look to be on the reasonable end, but certainly not make sure we're not out of whack compared to market. But where we've got some pricing opportunities, we've historically been pretty up to take them.", "Operator", "And now we go to Steven Valiquette with UBS.", "Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Actually I had the same question on the pricing strategy for '14, so I guess you just covered that. But just for background around the whole topic, I guess my question is, does it make sense from your perspective to telegraph these price increases to distributors overall? Just trying to figure out the strategy around that. I guess my general understanding is that manufacturers are trying to cut down on some of your quarterly sales volatility around this activity and typically you don't want to do anything to exacerbate it. Just kind of a better understanding this kind of just get a better feel for the strategy around that.", "Bret W. Wise", "This is Bret. The distributors are our business partners here in reaching the market. And we don't like to surprise them and frankly, won't surprise them so we typically tell them about our price increases about 6 weeks in advance. That gives them the time to do a couple of things: 1, develop their own inventory strategy; and 2, get the new pricing in their catalogs so they don't get stuck with in a position where they're buying at a higher price but still selling at an old price in their catalogs. So the discussion with them is balanced and that they're coming and here is what they are and that gives them time to react. What we did to kind of take the volatility out of the quarterly earnings for us was we moved all price increases, they go through the dealer channel to, at least in the United States, the October 1. And thus, we have the same phenomenon every year. Dealers buying ahead of price increase on October 1 and then liquidating inventory in the fourth quarter. That holds true except for 2012 when we had yet another price increase January 1 and thus, they didn't have the incentive to liquidate inventories in the fourth quarter. But generally speaking, we do telegraph the price increases -- well, not generally speaking, we always telegraph the price increases to the dealers so they have time to adapt their own business model.", "Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then one other just real quick question here, just on the gross margins. I kind of missed some of the color on that. But again, the key factors that are driving gross margin down a little bit year-over-year how much of that is maybe mixed versus other factors?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes. I mean, if you look at the year-on-year, there's a number of impacts here, Steven. The primary -- a lot of the net with the exception of medical device excise tax. So if you look at it, we're down 30 basis points on an adjusted basis in Q3 compared to prior year. The medical device in excise tax has been running us between 40 and 50 basis points negative for the year, so that kind of gives you some color there. As we look at it FX, is a bit of headwind as well to us on the gross profit line just to the way that some of the currencies break. We've had some nice synergies that have helped us on the gross profit line, mixes may be in aggregate a little bit negative. And again, those will swing quarter-to-quarter. So as we look at it, the way to kind of summarize it in aggregate would be everything pretty well netting. Maybe slightly positive with the exception of medical device tax. And that's basically saying, \"Hey we've got factors that are offsetting a currency headwind on our gross profit rate as well.\"", "Operator", "And next, with Jon Block with Stifel.", "Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Most have been answered, but maybe just 1 or 2. I guess, the first one, Bret, on Europe. Your 3Q growth rate was largely in line with the second quarter yet decent size competitor mentioned what they thought was a slightly improving environment, notably in Western Europe. So what do you think is going on out there? Do you think your level of share gains in Europe are being maintained? I think -- do you believe the environment is starting to turn over in Europe or do you still categorize it as largely choppy?", "Bret W. Wise", "Let me just -- there's couple of points here, I think. One, is we have a hard time drawing any conclusions about Europe in the third quarter because many of those countries basically shut down for a good portion of the third quarter. So we don't put a place -- a lot of reliance on trend changes in that short period of time. Number 2, overall, what we saw in Europe is that the specialties are a little bit weak and the general consumables are stronger. So the dental market is still there, it's just the high-end procedures, the high-end kind of discretionary part of dentistry is not picking up or not growing as fast as general dentistry is, everyday dentistry. So we didn't -- we're not placing -- we had slow growth in the U.S. -- or excuse me, in Europe, 0.3% this quarter. I think the last quarter was like 0.8% or 0.9%. So it slowed just a little bit, Q2 to Q3, but we're talking about few basis points here and we don't place a lot of emphasis on that small change. The other thing I'll add is qualitatively, what we find in Europe, even today, even in a tough environment, when we bring new innovation to market, even at a recently high price point, the dental market there, particularly in the consumable category, the dental market there tends to have an appetite for that and we get some pick up in our sales growth. So we're comfortable that Europe is not changing a whole lot right now. Still kind of in the low or flat mode. And we're hopeful that the general economy can start to now slowly pickup and dentistry will usually follow, although at a 1 to 2-quarter lag.", "Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "It's very helpful. And then just quickly on the implant side of the business. I know there was a lot of earlier questions on the European dental implant market, but in the U.S., your growth rate decelerated. I think it was low double-digit last quarter to mid-single-digit this quarter. Again, one of the lower cost implant guys sort noted an acceleration from high-teens to 20%. So can you talk to your thoughts, and I know a couple of big guys are yet to report, but your thoughts on share within the U.S. dental implant business. And then, how is the premium implant market growing versus the value segment?", "Bret W. Wise", "Yes. From the standpoint of the U.S. dental implant market, I think we are -- we're pleased with our position and our growth in this market. Bret made the comment that with a little bit of underlying economic growth, we've seen some nice growth and in the implant market. That's very encouraging for the implant market overall. The U.S. organization was our first organization to go live. They've [indiscernible] really, I think at the highest level. We believe that we are taking share in that market. Your comment regarding double digits to mid-single digits is accurate. We do believe that there were some things in the prior year base and that in fact, that our Q3 business is probably stronger than what the actually the numbers show, so we are very positive about that. From a standpoint of the value players, I think we have seen less commentary and less discussion about that segment in the U.S. market versus other markets. And it still, we believe, is a very strong premium market. I think the implant companies are recovering well and performing well. And I think we're pretty confident about our position in that market and how we're growing it.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll go to Glenn Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Jeffrey Bailin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "This is_Jeff Bailin in for Glenn. Maybe just one question to switch gears here towards the end of the call. On the medical segment at the top, you guys mentioned that you had some particularly strong results there. Could you comment a little bit about what's been driving the strength? Is it new product launches or market share? Just maybe any color you could offer?", "Bret W. Wise", "Sure. Actually, Jim, you want to take that?", "James G. Mosch", "Yes, absolutely. Jeff, from a standpoint of the medical market, I think we've done well in this segment. A lot of our effort and a lot of our success is been new product related. We launched a female catheter about over a year ago. And we see nice growth from that. Actually, we're really rounding year 2 of that and we continue to see strong growth with that product. And we also launched a male catheter earlier this year, and that has done very well as well and we're seeing nice growth and expansion in both these categorize. These were categories that we needed some updates, we needed some improvements, we've made the investments. And we've seen very nice results in that segment. So overall. So we're pleased with this segment. I think our emphasis has really been on investment and new product development. The North -- the U.S. market continues to expand. Obviously, there's a higher usage of disposable intermittent catheters in this market and we've been benefiting from that as well.", "Jeffrey Bailin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And maybe one follow-up on the Rest of World growth up 4.6%. Could you comment a little bit about the trends that you're seeing in the emerging markets and maybe your strategies there to improve product penetration?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes. I mean, it's Chris. Real quick on the emerging market growth. I mean, we're up basically high-single digits in terms of emerging markets. We're seeing pretty nice traction in, I guess, I would say in general, relative to our broad strategies. Focused again onto branding, focusing in on sales representation, focused on new products, et cetera. And again, I think that Jim commented on Middle East, Africa, reasonable recovery there. And again, I think that overall, we've continued to view these markets as very accretive to our overall growth rate, both now and moving in the future. So I mean, these continue to be focus areas for us.", "Bret W. Wise", "This is Bret. The one thing I would add to that is currency risk is pretty high in these markets. Recently, we've seen many currencies devalue slightly against the U.S. dollar or the Euro, which creates some headwind in getting products into these markets at a reasonable price point. But there's still a good appetite in these markets for dental products and growth there has remained kind of high single-digit overall throughout this year, so that's been favorable.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time, so I'd like to turn it back to our speakers for any additional remarks.", "Bret W. Wise", "Thank you for your interest in DENTSPLY with our conference call. I'll be around this afternoon for follow-up questions. Thank you.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Derek Leckow", "", "Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International's first quarter 2014 results. I'm joined by Bret Wise, DENTSPLY\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Mosch, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "I hope you had a chance to review our press release issued earlier this morning. I would point out that a copy of the release and a set of supplemental slides relating to any non-GAAP financials are also available for download on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.dentsply.com under the heading Events and Presentations. ", "I\u2019d like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language and U.S. GAAP reconciliation contained in today's press release also pertains to this conference call. We may make forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in the release and in our SEC filings. ", "It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make today. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. A recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.", "With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bret Wise. Bret?", "Bret Wise", "", "Thanks, Derek. Good morning, everyone. Thanks again for joining us on our first quarter call. I have some brief comments on our results and also some areas of focus for the company going forward, and then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim and Chris to elaborate further on those points.", "Starting with the headline here, we had a pretty good start to the year with adjusted EPS growth of 13.5% for the quarter, despite what has proven to be a pretty slow growth market environment. At a high level, this was driven by operating margin expansion, which we\u2019ve talked about many times on these calls over the last year or so, and this continues to be a high priority for the company going forward, and of course we\u2019ll speak more to that today.", "Overall, sales for the quarter were up 2.5%, excluding precious metals. The 2.5% reflects 1.1% internal growth and 0.8% from acquisitions to give us growth in local currencies of 1.9% and then the balance is currency translation. Internal growth in the U.S. was essentially flat at a positive 0.1%, which we think reflects market conditions and I\u2019ll elaborate more on that in a moment. Europe was negative 1.3%, greatly influenced by conditions in Russia and the Ukraine. And rest of world was positive 8.9%.", "So in the U.S., the quarter started out very slow, both for us and for the market. In fact, it was negative through February. This was driven entirely by the Eastern regions, states east of the Mississippi, which were very negative the first two months of the year, whereby the regions west of the Mississippi were positive and, quote normal.", "The market did recover a little bit in March and we believe that\u2019s more indicative of quote normal conditions for the U.S. and we like to see that continue going forward. The markets in Europe saw some acceleration, which is encouraging. We saw some acceleration in the Western part of Europe or the historical part of Europe, and that was offset by a very large, a very significant drop-off in Russia and in the Ukraine during the quarter.", "Kind of peeling the onion bag here, the fact is that this is one of the stronger quarters we\u2019ve seen for some time in Western Europe, which was up low-single digits, and Germany, in particular, was strong across most of or essentially all of our product lines, so very broad acceleration in Germany and Western Europe in the quarter, offset by some very negative results in Russia and the Ukraine.", "In rest of world, we had strong growth in Pacific RIM, Canada, Japan, Middle East and Australia, in other words, many, many countries that are included in that rest of world category for us. Japan is likely due in part to the increase in VAT that went effective April 1. We saw some buying ahead of that in the March time frame. But even without Japan, we had strong mid-single digit growth in the rest of world regions.", "Overall, it was a bit of a slow start on the top line due to the reasons I noted here, but I\u2019d say also some encouraging signs, particularly in Western Europe. On a global product category basis, dental consumables, dental specialties were both up low-single digits, healthcare was positive mid-single digits and lab was down low-single digits.", "Profitability was strong with the adjusted operating margins up 150 basis points, and as I mentioned, adjusted earnings per share were up 13.5%. This quarter was against a flat comp last year, I think it\u2019s important to note it was a relatively easier comp in the first quarter than the hurdle that we\u2019ll see for the remainder of the year.", "I\u2019d say these results reflect and they\u2019re part of an ongoing strategy to grow earnings through better leveraging our portfolio of companies and our cost structure, even in differing economic environments. So the strategy is to put the company in a position where we can grow operating margins and have some reinvestments in growth initiatives even in a slow growth environment. The same structure and same strategy should then provide for accelerated earnings growth when markets are more robust.", "Some of these strategies relate to synergies from recent acquisitions, which we\u2019ve talked about many times on these calls, but also from improving the leverage of our cost structure in the historical DENTSPLY businesses, including a team focused on capacity utilization and overhead absorption.", "During the first quarter, we did complete some plant consolidations and we have some planned for later in the year, which are already announced, and Jim will comment more on those in a moment. Also, in this quarter, we kicked off a global procurement initiative, which will be implemented over the next two to three years.", "The company has historically operated on a very decentralized basis for procurement. We\u2019re looking to bring some of that -- roll some of that up to give us much more purchasing power and we think that will generate benefits going forward. We do expect that there will be some near-term costs for this effort over the next few quarters, however, we see that we should be able to generate benefits sufficient to offset these costs by the time we exit the year.", "Based on the opportunities we see to better leverage our cost structure over the next few years and then free up cash for reinvestment in growth initiatives, we\u2019re establishing a new operating margin target this morning of 20% to be attained in three years. In addition, we see a path for much better asset turnover and utilization, which when combined with the operating margin improvement, will also improve our ROIC performance back to historical levels.", "So to sum up, we\u2019re pleased with our double-digit earnings growth for the start of the year. Looking at our current guidance, we\u2019re a bit ahead at this point, however, we do know we will have some incremental costs for the next one to two quarter for the points that I\u2019ve noted, and then should realize some savings to offset that later in the year.", "So, although it\u2019s early and market conditions remain uncertain to this point, we feel comfortable now adjusting full-year guidance to a range of $2.47 to $2.55 per adjusted diluted share for the full year.", "I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Jim for an update on some operational topics. Jim?", "James Mosch", "Thank you, Bret. I\u2019d like to provide a brief perspective on a few operational items and then turn it over to Chris for the financial review. As Bret mentioned, we experienced unusually slow growth in the U.S. in the first quarter, concentrated in the Eastern half of the country. We were negative through February, but saw conditions return to more normal trends in March.", "Turning to implants, we saw solid recovery in our German implant business, albeit to a lower comparison, driven by the German integration in the prior year, yet we are seeing stability and solid improvement. Key to our implant performance in the quarter and for this year is the launch of a new implant system, ASTRA TECH EV. ASTRA TECH EV was launched to several markets in Q1, but with primary focus on North America. The EV system builds upon a deep portfolio of technology and clinical documentation and specifically addresses clinical elements to take this system to a new level in terms of simplicity and flexibility.", "EV has new drilling protocol, which reduces clinical procedure time, a flexible and clinically-oriented surgical tray, improved initial stability upon implant placement, and with respect to the restorative procedure, a simplified abutment placement process that ties seamlessly into our market-leading ATLANTIS customized abutment platform.", "Our initial feedback from the U.S. market has been excellent and customer adoption is higher than anticipated. In Q2 and Q3, we will be executing the global launch of EV and concurrently managing the transition to the new system. While sales are initially driven by current customer conversion, we have been pleased with our ability to convert competitive platforms.", "Other new product launches during Q1 included ProTaper Gold, which is an improvement to our market-leading ProTaper endodontic file system. ProTaper Gold offers superior flexibility, fatigue resistance and clinical utilities. In addition, we continue to get traction from product launched in 2013 such as AQUASIL ULTRA Cordless, TPH Spectra, MIDWEST automate, the Origo male catheter, and two new varnish products, all launched in 2013.", "Operationally, we have been pursuing several initiatives to improve operating performance. We completed one plant consolidation in Q1 and announced another that will be completed at the end of Q2. This is consistent with our strategy to improve capacity utilization and return on our invested capital in part as a synergy from recent acquisitions and in part from leveraging our broadest platform of assets, including the historical DENTSPLY businesses.", "As part of these efforts, we are also looking for better working capital utilization, although it typically requires an investment going into these activities. Overall, despite some slow growth this quarter, we are pleased with our ability to better manage, leverage our portfolio and expand margins.", "I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Chris Clark to review the financial results.", "Christopher Clark", "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to provide some detail on our financial performance for the first quarter and also discuss our 2014 earnings and capital allocation outlook and finally some additional perspective on the initiatives that Brett mentioned in his remarks.", "For the first quarter, sales, excluding precious metals, grew 2.5% compared to prior year, including 110 basis points of internal growth, 80 basis point benefit from recent acquisition and favorable currency translation of 60 basis points. ", "Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 57.8% of sales excluding precious metals, which was a decline of approximately 40 basis points from 58.2% in the first quarter of 2013. This reflects the aggregate negative currency transaction impact as a result of the decline in rates of the emerging market and non-European developed market currencies that I spoke about in the last earnings call. And this basket of currencies is now down 10% versus the U.S. dollar compared to a year ago, which in the gross profit rate line really more than offset a net positive price impact in the quarter.", "SG&A expenses declined 2.3% on an adjusted basis and as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals, they improved by 200 basis points to 40.1%, compared to 42.1% in the first quarter of 2013. This reflects the impact of synergies from restructuring and efficiency initiatives that we implemented last year, as well as lower spending on trade shows, notably the biennial IDS show.", "Operating margin for the quarter improved by 150 basis points to 17.7% of sales, excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis, compared to 16.2% in the first quarter last year, reflecting the better leverage and the overall SG&A savings that I just described. Importantly, on a rolling four-quarter basis, adjusted operating margin has improved by 70 basis points from the previous four quarters, which is well in excess of our long-term objective of 20 to 40 basis points annually, and this is coming despite the challenging global market environment, as well as sizeable headwinds from currency and medical device tax over much of that period.", "This is consistent with the comments we have made previously and that Bret reinforced this morning, that a key operational objective has been to improve operating platform, our operating platform to allow for margin expansion even in slower growth environments.", "Currency represented a headwind to earnings in the quarter of approximately $0.02 per share due largely -- due to the negative impacts from the currencies in Canada, Russia, Australia, Latin America and Asia-Pacific region relative to the strengthening of the euro and the Swiss franc versus the U.S. dollar. As a reminder, as these currencies weaken, our cost of products in local currencies there rises, creating gross margin headwinds as we import goods into these markets from the U.S. and from Europe.", "Our reported tax rate for the first quarter was 23.5% while our non-operating -- our operating or non-GAAP tax rate, excuse me, was 22.6%, which represented an 80 basis point increase compared to our operating rate for the first quarter of last year. This is consistent with our comment from the last call that we continue to anticipate that tax will be a bit of -- will be a headwind between 70 basis points and 100 basis points for the year.", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY international on an as-reported basis in the first quarter was $72.9 million or $0.50 per diluted share and this compares to $71.7 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2013. These results include a number of items which we\u2019ve listed in the schedules of the release.", "On an adjusted basis, net earnings grew to $85.5 million from $75.2 million in the prior-year quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13.5% to $0.59 per diluted share. Of course, this earnings growth rate includes the headwinds for both currency and tax that I described earlier.", "The company incurred approximately $800,000 in net restructuring costs in the quarter. These costs are related to the plant consolidations that Jim mentioned and we anticipate that we are going to see additional restructuring charges related to these initiatives as well as other footprint consolidation opportunities as we move forward.", "Moving on to cash flow, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $64.6 million, up from $34.8 million last year. Inventories now stand at 120 days, which is up six days, compared to December 2013, and up 10 days compared to prior year. And as we mentioned on several previous earnings calls, we have strategically increased inventory in a few businesses as part of transition plans associated with anticipated operational changes. We anticipate that inventory may continue to increase slightly through midyear to support these efforts before returning to more normal levels as we move through 2014 and 2015.", "Accounts receivable days were 61 days at the end of March, up five days from year end, mainly due to seasonality, and are up two days compared to March 2013. Capital expenditures were $25 million in the quarter while depreciation was $21 million and amortization was $13 million.", "In the quarter, the company repurchased just under 900,000 shares. In terms of our capital deployment approach, I want to reiterate that our intent continues to be to support repaying debt while also using -- balancing uses of free cash flow to support reinvesting in the business, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends, so really continuing to be a balanced approach.", "Finally, as Bret stated, based on our first quarter results as well as our current view of the relevant market factors, we\u2019re adjusting our adjusted -- we\u2019re updating our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.47 to $2.55.", "Our guidance reflects the impact of a more difficult comparison in Q2, including a 19.2% operating margin rate last year as well as additional consulting costs associated with the efficiency purchasing initiatives that Bret described. It also reflects the anticipated benefits from these efforts as we move through the year, recognizing that these will accelerate as we move to 2015 and beyond, enabling us to return to a 20% adjusted operating margin rate in three years.", "This completes our prepared remarks and we certainly appreciate your support and we\u2019d now be glad to take any questions you might have.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Bret, just want to talk to you on the operating margin target, I don\u2019t remember you guys ever kind of throwing a three-year target out there, maybe you have, I just don\u2019t remember at this point, but a few questions on that, one, should we be thinking about the 170 basis points or so that that implies over a three-year period of improvement off last year\u2019s number of kind of a consistent 50 to 60 basis points a year, each of the next three years, number one. Number two, anything other than better procurement, maybe that you could go into some detail on what gives you the confidence over the next three years on that. And then, what are your organic growth assumptions in that, if we go back to a 4% or 5% organic growth rate, would there be upside to that or is that kind of a base case assumption that we stick with at this point? Thanks.", "Bret Wise", "There is a lot there, but let me try to plow through it. The operating margin target of 20% is compared to a baseline 2013 of 17.6%, so it\u2019s a 240 basis points improvement over the three-year period. Like most things in life, it won\u2019t come in, in a linear basis, it will be a little bit bumpy. For instance, we had a very strong operating margin improvement in the first quarter. We\u2019re going up against a very tough comp in the second quarter. So I think even in this year you won\u2019t see it come in on a linear basis over the four quarters.", "But I think you should expect to see us make progress against that 230 -- 240 basis points each year, it\u2019s not that we\u2019re going to take a year off, we\u2019re going to be needing to make progress on that each year. You mentioned procurement and other things, there are other things, including better leveraging our whole cost structure, our overhead structure and our capacity utilization in the facilities in particular on top of procurement. So it\u2019s a broader initiative than just the procurement initiative that we mentioned on the call here this morning.", "I\u2019m not going to make any assumptions on organic growth over that period of time, the reason is it\u2019s hard enough for us to predict a year. I don\u2019t want to predict three years out. But the theory here and the modeling that we\u2019re doing is, is that we would adjust our cost structure such that we could grow earnings in a low growth environment which would kind of turbocharge the earnings if the global consumable market return to that 4% to 5% range. ", "So we\u2019re taking both those into account, and rather than making an organic growth assumption out three years, we\u2019re trying to set the company up for success despite what the market conditions would hold.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "That\u2019s helpful. And then, just one last question, just on Russia and Ukraine, as you mentioned that took a big chunk out of Europe. Is there any chance you could give us any kind of Europe ex those markets or size for us, how bad those markets are, where and what percentage they might be of Europe in that, just to help us out with the math on that.", "Bret Wise", "I\u2019m going to start on this and I\u2019m going to let then Chris comment, probably on our international growth, ex Russia and Ukraine. But just for perspective, because of the devaluation of the currencies in both Russia and Ukraine, I think that those markets are feeling a lot of pressure and consumer confidence is certainly off because of the war activity.", "So our sales in the first quarter in those two countries were down strong double digits, I mean materially down. And that\u2019s in part due to some pretty tight credit standards that we hold to and in part due to, I think, consumer confidence in those markets as well. Now, that could rebound at any time, but it\u2019s hard to predict when that might happen. So let me then turn this over to Chris.", "Christopher Clark", "On the international basis, excluding Russia and CIS, we\u2019re up low-to-mid single digits, so I mean, we were north of 3%, and again, I think overall have some pretty nice momentum, as Bret mentioned, in Western Europe as well as in many of those rest of world countries.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "All right, Chris. I\u2019ll work through the math, but that -- Europe, that was not a Europe number up low-to-mid single digits, that\u2019s the international. Thank you.", "Bret Wise", "Europe would be up low-single digits as well.", "Christopher Clark", "Europe is also up low-single digits.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.", "Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse", "Bret, I just wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made regarding the U.S. I think you seemed to suggest that U.S. was negative for the first two months of the year, and you said the weakness was predominantly in the Eastern half of the country. And I'm guessing you're making the obvious connection that it was weather-related. I was wondering if you could sort of quantify what you thought weather might have impacted your sales in the current quarter. And then as a follow-up to that, I think you suggested that March had kind of snapped back, and I'm kind of curious if you're willing to extend that comment to April. Are you pretty confident that it's sort of back to business as normal?", "Bret Wise", "Let me just give you a little bit of color there. First of all, Derek has a jar in the table here and every time I use the W word, I have to put $10 in the jar. So I\u2019m not going to use the W word.", "Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse", "Every other company is, you might as well.", "Bret Wise", "But we\u2019re different. To give you a little perspective, there was a 500 basis point difference between our regions, east of the Mississippi and west of the Mississippi for the first two months of the year. So it was a pretty dramatic notable and material impact in January and February.", "That did mitigate somewhat as we exited the quarter, such that the difference for the entire quarter is only 250 basis points, but it was still pretty material impact over the entire quarter and again that\u2019s the difference between East and West.", "I have a little bit of hard time quantifying what weather actually did to the U.S. market and to our results in particular in a quantifiable way, but it\u2019s certainly clear that it diminished the growth pretty significantly. I mean offices were closed in the East side of the country for three, four days during the quarter, so that comes right out of sales.", "It\u2019s premature for me to talk about April. I will say that March did perk up quite a bit and we\u2019re hopeful to see that continue now into the second quarter. Anything to add to that?", "Christopher Clark", "No, I think it\u2019s pretty accurate. Again, the -- March did come back. Now we have an extra shipping day in March as well, but in short, there is no doubt that it was a different pattern than what we saw in January and February.", "Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse", "Hey, Chris, maybe if I could just follow up on the comments you made regarding currency in the quarter. I think you suggested -- you gave us some detail on the currency, and I think you suggested it was a $0.02 impact in the quarter. If I go back to the comments you made last quarter, I think you were embedding within your original guidance a $0.04 currency impact for the full year. And it seems like you've already incurred half of that hit in the first quarter. How are you thinking about the impact of FX on the full year now? And has that sort of changed within the context of your guidance?", "Christopher Clark", "Yes, Glen, I think at this point, we\u2019re pretty similar to where we -- I think it\u2019s pretty similar to where we were. You are right in the context that we indicated about $0.04 headwind embedded in the guidance. We\u2019ve experienced $0.02 in the first quarter. We knew first quarter was going to be the most difficult comparison for us.", "The challenge obviously is the rates are just bouncing around a ton right now. We are anticipating that the headwind, if you will, in the emerging market currencies and really the non-European developed currencies will continue. And obviously that\u2019s got some risk on sales as well because of the pricing challenges there as well in some of those markets.", "But at this point, it\u2019s just too early and too volatile really for us to forecast differently, so we\u2019re keeping a close eye on it and we\u2019ll obviously reflect any significant changes as we move forward, but I think at this point in time, we are staying put with where we were.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.", "Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs", "Just wanted to circle back, Bret, you've talked a lot about on this call about accelerating efforts to leverage the platform and get more out of the cost structure. Given there hasn't really been any notable change to the organization in the last few years, I was just curious maybe around timing and what specific initiatives and timelines that you're targeting to really get more leverage out of the business.", "Bret Wise", "I think if we go back and talk about or look at what we\u2019ve been talking about on these calls for some time, this has been a topic that\u2019s been of importance to us. We did see our operating margins decline two, three years ago coming out of the recession, in part due to ortho and in part due to the acquisition of ASTRA TECH and we\u2019ve been busy trying to repair the ortho business, and then also get the synergies out of the ASTRA TECH acquisition, and I think you\u2019re seeing us get some of those benefits here over the last four quarters.", "The idea though is that the business is structured largely as it was when it was a $1 billion business, now it\u2019s a $3 billion business, it\u2019s rather complex in the supply chain, we think there is some ability -- things we learned through the ASTRA TECH integration but also some other learnings that we\u2019ve had that make it apparent that there is probably more to leverage in this platform than maybe thought four, five years ago and so we\u2019re now moving forward to get those.", "So, I wouldn\u2019t consider this something that\u2019s brand new. I think that you\u2019ll probably see this, if you go back and look, you\u2019ll see this in our remarks over the last 12 months or maybe 18 months, but there is an acceleration in the efforts and in certain cases like procurement, which we\u2019ve mentioned we\u2019ve gone out to get outside help to make that -- to get to that quicker. So I think it\u2019s an acceleration of what we are thinking before rather than a directional change in what we were thinking before.", "Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs", "I think coupled with the introduction of the three-year operating margin goal, it just seems a little bit maybe more pronounced this call. These efforts clearly have been ongoing. I guess just changing gears over to the implant business, and I apologize if I missed this, but can you guys maybe just update us on what the growth looked like in the quarter by region? How have the implant -- how have your implant businesses trended relative to your original expectations, and any notable change in the competitive landscape?", "James Mosch", "This is Jim Mosch. As far as our global implant business is concerned, we have the benefit as the premium implant companies that reported at this point in time, and what we see from a market perspective is that, on a constant currency basis, the growth is going to range at 2% to 6%.", "As we look at our own business, we would say that we\u2019re on the lower end of that range, however, as Bret mentioned, one of our more significant impacts was in Europe, within Russian and CIS, and if we exclude that impact, we would be at the upper end of that range. And we are one of the market leaders in Russia, so the impact was certainly more pronounced.", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll take our next question Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies", "Bret or Jim, can you speak to any traction you're seeing with the new MTM product and how is the uptake of that pacing in the U.S. relative to your expectations? Do you think you're capturing any share at the low end of the market there?", "James Mosch", "As you know, Brandon, we launched that in the latter part of 2013, really kind of a preliminary launch at the ADA in October. The traction has been good and one of the aspects of the system is that customers purchase a kit, they\u2019re trained and then there is a -- they do their initial cases and then the question is your ability to build upon that case submission.", "And we\u2019ve seen good movement in that. We have a couple of regions we had launched in Canada earlier and actually we can see their progress and how those case submissions have grown and we are beginning to see traction in the United States. So we are pleased with our ability to place kits, but I would say we are probably at the early stage of that.", "Bret Wise", "And I might add to that, Brandon, that this product, because of some technique sensitivity and so forth, requires clinical education to get it moving. So one of the barriers here is to get people into courses, get them trained and get them through that first case submission that Jim was talking about. We\u2019re pleased with where it is, although I think we\u2019ve emphasized that this is a product for minor tooth movement, not full cases, and it will be interesting to see where we can take it.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies", "And then Chris, on the inventory front, do you think we're at a plateau level here yet? And could you give us an update on your operating cash flow expectations for the year?", "Christopher Clark", "From an inventory standpoint, we indicated that inventories would creep up a bit through the first half of the year associated with really some of the strategic moves, obviously we referenced a bit of that this morning. I would anticipate, Brandon, that could possibly come up a little bit more in the second quarter and then our expectations are that inventory comes down from there and we make progress on that. ", "Certainly, from a cash flow standpoint, we\u2019re pleased relative to the first quarter. I think that we\u2019ve got some opportunities relative to net working capital as we move forward. From there, I think that\u2019s something certainly that management is very focused on. So, from that angle, I think, over the -- probably another quarter of a bit of an inventory build, but then over like several quarters our expectation is we make more progress on that.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "I wonder if you could spend a minute on execution in the implant business. Now that you're at the outset here of 2014, we have a better understanding of what the realities are in the end markets, and you're through the sales force integrations globally. Would you say you're at a point now in 2014 where you feel like you're on your front foot in a position to take share? Are you in a position where you might be thinking at all about any incremental changes to distribution or product strategy? And can you give us a sense for where you think you might land relative to market growth this year?", "James Mosch", "Yes, Steve. This is Jim Mosch. From a standpoint of what you characterize with the integration, I would say that that\u2019s accurate. We completed really our last integration, which was Japan in June of last year, as one of our -- and we did really three largest ones in last year which was Japan, France and Germany in the first half of last year.", "We have moved through those and some of those, as we mentioned with Germany, we\u2019ve seen stabilization and I feel that we are on our front foot. As we look at the business overall, I mentioned EV, I can\u2019t emphasize enough, we do not -- we have basically three implant platforms, this is a new one, it is very much of a successor to the current OsseoSpeed TX system. So this is a major event for us. And we will be fully occupied with the global launch of this product in 2014 and beyond.", "Additionally, we continue to enhance our ATLANTIS platform. That continues to be a real strong part of our portfolio, continues to grow and expand. We\u2019ve been very pleased with that performance and certainly we will seek to expand that globally.", "We also have plans to expand our regenerative portfolio, which is primarily U.S. based at this point in time. So we have a lot of activities in place that we feel that will allow us really to leverage the business platform that we\u2019ve created. And I think we are in a comfortable position. There are some markets that certainly are challenging right now, obviously we mentioned the whole Russia CIS issue, Southern Europe has kind of -- it takes a step forward, two steps back, but overall we are comfortable where we are progressing.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "And then, just one clarification on the business in North America, I know thinking back to a couple quarters ago, there was an expectation that we'd see a normalization of inventories in the distributor channel and that might be a bit of a drag. Was that a factor here in the quarter, and are we through that trend where distributor inventories are back to normal? Thanks.", "Christopher Clark", "Yes. It\u2019s Chris. I will take that. At this point, we really think channel inventories in aggregate really have minimum impact on sales growth in the quarter. We had some gives and takes across the businesses. Obviously, if you look at Japan, for instance, there\u2019s probably some build in the channel there. There was some takedown of some channels, some other businesses.", "So, we really don\u2019t think at this point that the channel inventory net change in the quarter was demonstrably different from what we saw a year ago. So I wouldn\u2019t guide that it really had a real impact on the quarter results.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Krieger with William Blair.", "Robbie Fatta - William Blair", "Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Robbie Fatta in for John today. A follow-up on the impact of EV, how should we think of aggregate new product introduction benefits in 2014 versus 2013 given this significant launch?", "James Mosch", "Yes, Robbie. When we look at an implant conversion, I think, as I said, this is a successor product. So at the end of the day, our expectation is, over a period of time, we will have a group of EVs as opposed to the previous OsseoSpeed product, that\u2019s really what our objective is.", "Our long-term objective is not to have a legacy implant system in the marketplace. So, in order to do that, obviously you have a conversion process and that oftentimes the involvement of the customer basically purchasing a new surgical kit also some new implants. There is a tendency for them to liquidate their existing inventories at times so that you see a little bit of a pullback of a purchase of the older system as they buy the new system and there is a conversion process.", "One of the things that I mentioned in my comments is we are happy that the clinical effectiveness and utility of this product has encouraged some competitive platform users. We are heavily focused with our existing conversion, our existing users at this point in time. We would hope for a little bit of an uptick, but to be realistic, in 2014, we\u2019re very much in a conversion phase and I think that that\u2019s going to be fairly consuming from a standpoint of our business focus.", "Robbie Fatta - William Blair", "And just as a quick follow-up, on the acquisition front, how are you guys thinking about that this year? Is the activity ramping up or are you seeing it fairly stable right now?", "Christopher Clark", "Yes, Robbie. It\u2019s Chris. At this point I think a couple of points in that. First off, we are obviously focusing on integrating kind of three transactions here over the last three of four months. We certainly have others in the pipeline. I would say it\u2019s certainly an area we continue to be active, but it would be premature really at this point to comment further other than obviously acquisition growth and making the company stronger via acquisition continues to be a key focus area for us, but it\u2019s always hard to predict the timing of transactions. We continue to be active. We\u2019re, right now, focused on integrating kind of the transactions here, the three we\u2019ve had over the last few months and again, we continue to pound the pavement.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel.", "Jon Block - Stifel", "Maybe first one, Bret, I know you gave some commentary in and around implants, but is there any specifics you can share with us within specialties of low single-digit growth? If you could break out ortho versus endo versus implant directionally?", "Bret Wise", "We don\u2019t like to break the business down into eight or nine pieces and give all the pieces, but I will tell you that, as Jim mentioned, implants was in the -- he said the range was 2% to 6%. We are in low end of that range with Russia, high end of that range without Russia, so that gives you some idea there.", "Endodontics continue to perform well and ortho is a business that\u2019s under really, really heavy competitive conditions right now. So we\u2019ve performed the lowest of the three businesses in that category.", "Jon Block - Stifel", "And then just sort of a bigger picture on a higher level, if you can speak to your thoughts on market share. It's always been sort of the DENTSPLY mantra to get on the call and say you've taken market share, and I realize there's always moving parts and you called out Russia. But if I go back and look at your numbers over the past maybe four, five, six quarters, it looks like you might be lagging versus some of your competitors. So can you speak to how you feel DENTSPLY's position in the market has evolved over the past four or five quarters, and do you still think you're taking share? And if not, how is that going to change in the coming quarters?", "Bret Wise", "Well, it varies by business of course, but overall, for instance, in this quarter, we feel pretty good about Western Europe and the rest of world categories. I would say with rest of world close to nine, we probably are taking share in those regions. Western Europe and Germany, we feel pretty good about right now given the results we had this quarter.", "Certainly in Russia and Ukraine, who knows because we\u2019re down strong double digits, I assume everybody is down pretty significantly there. We just happen to have a large share, so maybe it\u2019s a disproportionate impact on us.", "On the U.S., I am a little bit hesitant to comment yet, I mean we think the market was flat in the quarter, that\u2019s based on our results because we don\u2019t have the industry data yet and we don\u2019t have the two large distributors having reported although I think one reported today, so we might learn more than that today.", "But we suspect that our number of 0.1% growth seems low, but it also feels to us that the market was probably flat, maybe the market was down, we don\u2019t know yet. So I don\u2019t anticipate that we are losing share with a 0.1% growth as low as that seems. So overall, I think I feel pretty good about it. Of course, it varies by business. Some areas, I think we\u2019re taking share, some areas that we\u2019re neutral and there is probably a few isolated cases where we are losing share. I think in the lab category, in particular, we continue to lose some share.", "Jon Block - Stifel", "Maybe two more quick ones if I could. First is a clarification, the 20% op margin goal, is that specific to full-year '16, full-year '17, somewhere in between, just any clarity there?", "Bret Wise", "Well, it\u2019s three years out, so it\u2019s full-year \u201817. We like to be in a position exiting \u201816 where we can hit that target in \u201817.", "Jon Block - Stifel", "Lastly, Bret, last call you talked about your guidance and sort of lined it up versus market growth of around 100 BPs in North America and a little bit more than that O-U.S. And like you said, weather-wise, we got off to a slow start in North America and then O-U.S. you ran into problems in Russia. Yet, here you are confirming guidance, arguably bumping it up by $0.01. Can you just compare and contrast that? Do you still feel good on those -- the market growth metrics that you broke out last quarter going forward for the year? Thanks, guys.", "Bret Wise", "Okay, that\u2019s a good question. I think what we said in our February call is we are expecting a 100 basis point improvement in market conditions in both the U.S. and Europe. I would say generally speaking, we see that emerging in Western Europe, we like to see that continue, that\u2019s always a risk, but right now we feel pretty good about that.", "Certainly, the U.S. did not accelerate and in fact slowed down materially in this first quarter. We\u2019re thinking that\u2019s an anomaly and we\u2019re going to see that bounce back later in the year, that is embedded in our guidance that we are going to -- we expect the U.S. market to improve not only over what happened in the first quarter, but what happened last year. So there is some risk to that, because we haven\u2019t seen that happen yet.", "Russia and the Ukraine, the lapse was not in our guidance and we\u2019ll have to overcome that in other areas in order to be in our guidance range and we\u2019ve got some ideas on how to do that. So we are still expecting the acceleration in the U.S. and Europe. Russia looks very uncertain, currency looks very uncertain and on balance though we think that the guidance lift here makes sense based on what we see in the pipeline right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.", "Steven Valiquette - UBS", "Just a couple of clarification questions from me as well. First, on the incremental cost you talked about for the next one to two quarters for the savings programs, are those going to be considered separate restructuring costs or are those going to flow through the P&L and the regular COGS and/or SG&A lines?", "Christopher Clark", "Those consulting costs will flow through the regular SG&A and COGS lines.", "Steven Valiquette - UBS", "And also just to clarify a little further on the 20% EBIT margin goal. Will most of that expansion then come through in the gross margin line or should we expect some material improvement in the SG&A line as a percent of revenues as well? Thanks.", "Bret Wise", "It\u2019s going to be a balance of both. I think on the capacity utilization, the overhead absorption issue that will come through the cost of goods sold line and then leveraging our overhead structure, our SG&A structure, of course, comes through the SG&A line. So it will be a balance.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Just wonder if I could get your thoughts on capital spending. Certainly, the figure you're looking at this year and then going forward, given your operating profit margin goal, and again, in consideration for plant consolidations and so forth.", "Christopher Clark", "Greg, it\u2019s Chris. We\u2019ll take a shot at that. I think relative to 2014, I think in our original guidance we guided to about $130 million in capital spending for the year. That includes some larger projects that -- we have some carryover, if you will, from 2013, so I still think that\u2019s a reasonable number at this stage in the game, if anything, we may be a little bit light to that, but I think that $130 million is probably a reasonable number.", "As we move forward, I mean certainly one of the objectives of these initiatives are to better leverage our cost structure and I would say that includes capital spending as well. There may be some investments necessary to do that, but again we\u2019ll provide color on that as we move into it. But I think over a longer period of time, you would expect again as part of our cost structure, us being able to leverage our asset base more effectively as well.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "And related to that, are there any changes being made in the R&D, the way it's being handled out of facilities or the focus?", "Christopher Clark", "R&D will be part of this effort to get better utilization of R&D. Today it\u2019s spread around quite a bit throughout the company although we don\u2019t think there will be a physical consolidation of R&D. There might be a virtual impact on R&D where we bring scientists together on platforms virtually. I\u2019d also say that R&D, we mentioned we think we can improve our efficiency and then part of that efficiency we\u2019ll put back and reinvestment in R&D is one of the areas that we would focus on for that reinvestment.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "One last one. You mentioned 900,000 shares purchased in the quarter. What was the dollar amount spent on the share repurchase in the quarter?", "Christopher Clark", "It was about $36 million, net of option proceeds.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Jim, one follow-up just on the EV product itself, I'm going back through my notes, and it looks to me like you guys were going to be selling that product or thought you were going to be selling at about a 5% to 10% price premium to your other kind of higher-end products. Is that what you're seeing so far in the U.S. market? And maybe if you're getting that, would love to hear kind of how you're positioning that to your customers in a market where generics are obviously gaining traction, how you position a premium price and a price increase to your customers. Thanks.", "James Mosch", "The EV product is at a slight price premium. I think in the -- as I kind of outlined to the earlier question, in the early stages of this process where you\u2019re converting a customer, you have an awful lot going on there as it relates to the swap out of surgical kits and things of that nature, the purchase of those, these tend to be a bundle purchase, so some of that is difficult to see at the early stages. We are seeing a slight price uptick and we will expect that to continue long term.", "Bret Wise", "I\u2019ll add to that, Jeff, that this market, in particular, we think the technology, innovation technology and clinical evidence is important to the clinicians, remains important to clinicians. So this product is not one that really competes on price per se, it\u2019s competing on the performance that is going to give the clinician and that\u2019s where we are getting a very positive response from our customer base.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Bret, do you think that will be true as you go into Europe then with it, especially into maybe Southern Europe and/or Germany where the generics have maybe picked up some traction here recently?", "Bret Wise", "We have, speaking to Germany specifically, we have a very strong position with our premium products in Germany in both really all three systems, ASTRA TECH System, XIVE and ANKYLOS. And we\u2019ve done some preliminary launch with some of our KOLs and whatnot, it\u2019s been very well received. We anticipate we are going to get good uptick in Germany.", "We had some very preliminary launches similarly in France and the U.K. which will kick up more in the second part of the year and so we\u2019ve seen very good response. So that aspect, I think, Jeff, we feel pretty comfortable with. Obviously, the markets of Southern Europe, Spain and Italy, the premium systems are not as strong a portion of those markets. There\u2019s a lot of local players, and that\u2019s really kind of dictated more by the structure of the market.", "Operator", "And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Derek Leckow for any additional or closing remarks.", "Derek Leckow", "Okay. Thank you all very much for your interest in DENTSPLY. That concludes our conference call. If you have other questions, I\u2019m available today for follow-up. Good-bye.", "Operator", "And that concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Brandon Couillard", "Operator", "Good day, and welcome to the DENTSPLY International Second Quarter 2014 Earnings call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Derek W. Leckow", "Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International's Second Quarter 2014 Results. I'm joined by Bret Wise, DENTSPLY's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Mosch, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "I hope you have a chance to review our press release issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release and a set of supplemental slides and information relating to the non-GAAP financials are available for download on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.dentsply.com, under the heading, Events and Presentations.", "I'd like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language and the U.S. GAAP reconciliation contained in today's release also pertain to this conference call.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. A recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website.", "With that, now I like to turn the call over to Bret Wise. Bret?", "Bret W. Wise", "Thank you, Derek, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. I'd like to provide some insights on the market, how we see that by region and then our performance at a high level. And then I'll turn the call over to Chris -- or Chris and Jim for both operational comments and financial results.", "Our market developments, we entered the year anticipating that the markets in both the U.S. and Europe should see some improvement driven by job growth in the U.S. and then a balanced improvement in economic conditions in Europe.", "Through Q2, we have not really seen any meaningful improvement in either market. Rather it seems that both markets are stable, but in a slow-growth mode. So although we remain optimistic that these anticipated improvements will materialize, we're a bit more cautious about the market conditions than we were earlier in the year.", "Specifically, on the market by region. First the U.S. or North America more broadly, I would describe the market as stable overall, but lacking any real growth momentum. The first quarter, this year, was slow due to office closures from severe weather on the East Coast. We do believe the market activity improved a bit in April, which may have reflected some pent-up demand, but then the market growth rate seemed to slow sequentially over the balance of the quarter, June in particular.", "In Europe, things remain slow with some limited signs of growth. The U.S. market -- the U.K. market, for instance, continues to be a bright spot. Southern Europe appears more stable than it has been in recent years, and the rest of Europe is a mixed bag.", "The Russian and Ukrainian markets continue to contract, although at slower rate than we saw in the first quarter, but probably still in the contracting in the high-single-digits or maybe even low-single-digit range.", "In the Rest of World regions, the results are also mixed with most regions growing in the most recent quarter with the exception of Japan and Brazil that both declined on event-driven factors. In Japan, the market contracted due the VAT increase that was -- came effective April 1, which clearly moved buying activity into Q1 and out of Q2.", "In Brazil, the market declined notably in June as the government instituted 5 additional national holiday days in the month of June in connection with the World Cup.", "Moving to DENTSPLY's performance. Sales growth, x PM in the quarter was up 2.1%. However, internal growth was slightly negative by 0.6% on 1 less selling day than the prior year quarter, which was a disappointment to us. Constant currency growth was slightly better at plus 0.3% and currency added 1.8% in the current quarter.", "U.S. internal growth was slightly positive at plus 0.2% against the challenging 6.2% comp last year with the growth, this year, driven primarily by our chair-side consumables that were up nicely. However, offsetting this lag continues to be negative. And in the non-dental segment, we had an industrial customer in source of product, which reduced U.S. growth by 80 basis points this quarter, and this impact will continue for the next couple of quarters. This particular product is a legacy product from an acquisition over a decade ago where volumes are now near 0 and it's non-core to our business.", "If you look at the dental business, it was up roughly 1% internal in the U.S. So in U.S., we had some reasonable performances in certain product lines, but also some categories where we have some work to do.", "In Europe, internal growth was generally consistent with what we've been seeing: It was down slightly, 1.3%. CIS, again, is a drag on our results and throughout the region. Rest of the region, I'd say growth is hard to find, spotty at best. x CIS, internal growth was down slightly in the region in the quarter.", "In Rest of World, we are negative 0.6%, and that was heavily influenced by Japan. Overall, we had positive internal growth in the Pacific Rim, in Latin America, excluding Brazil, in Canada and in the Mideast and we are down double-digits in Japan.", "Again, the increase in the VAT tax in Japan April 1 boosted our first quarter sales ahead of that tax, and I think we noted that on our first quarter call and is now depressing the second quarter result by a comparable amount. In total, Brazil and Japan took more than 350, probably closer -- more than 300 basis points out of the Rest of world, maybe as much as 350 basis points out of the Rest of World category for us.", "I'll recall that we had positive internal growth of almost 9% in the first quarter in the Rest of World regions. So in this category, we take the noise out for Japan, I think the year-to-date numbers probably make more sense to look at which is 4% internal growth year-to-date. Also important to remember Rest of World category represents both developed and emerging markets for us.", "Moving to earnings. As we've noted on the last couple of calls, we're very focused on improving the long-term efficiency of the business both at the product cost level and overhead -- and also the overhead structure. This quarter, we are faced with a very tough comparison from last year when operating margins were 19.2%, so we're very pleased to have exceeded that level in the current year, up slightly at 19.3%.", "Adjusted EPS was an all-time quarterly record for us and was up 4.5%, again, against a tough comp last year. And in this sales environment, this earnings performance, we think is a pretty good achievement.", "Year-to-date, sales were up 2.3%. x precious metals, operating margins are up 80 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 8.5%. So despite the lack of meaningful pickup in the growth, thus far, we remained comfortable for full year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.47 to $2.55 per diluted share.", "Lastly, before I turn the call over to Jim, as we've noted on prior calls, we are very focused on cash flow generation and improving the return on our investments. We have some pretty good results in those categories this quarter and year to date, and Chris is going to comment more on those in his remarks.", "So let me turn the call over to Jim now for operational comments.", "James G. Mosch", "Thank you, Bret. I would like to provide an update on the status of previously launched products, products currently in launch, as well as the perspective on a few operational items. I'll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review.", "First, in our consumables business, we're pleased with the performance of Aquasil Ultra Cordless launched in Q4 of last year. This is a unique 1-step system for impression taking which, in most cases, eliminates the need for the traction cord, which is a time-consuming step for the dentist and often unpleasant process for the patient.", "We had a very successful launch in Q4, which has continued into 2014. Today, we have over 2300 offices using Aquasil Ultra Cordless and anticipate increased adoption in coming quarters.", "In Q1 of this year, DENTSPLY implants announced the launch of a new implant system, Astra Tech EV or evolution. The EV system has a new drilling protocol, which reduces clinical procedure time, a flexible clinically oriented surgical tray and also provides improved initial stability upon implant placement.", "Early adoption has been excellent. And to date, EV already represents 20% of the previous Astra Tech implant system volume. However, one challenge is that we have seen some inventory liquidation by current customers in anticipation of the new system. We will be expanding the launch globally in the second half of 2014 and expect continued success with the EV system.", "In our preventive business in Q2, we launched an extension of the market-leading Cavitron brand with the FITGRIP Cavitron insert. FITGRIP is an advancement on DENTSPLY Cavitron's ultrasonic inserts that adds a thick comfortable grip to lessen muscle load and pinch force for improved ergonomics. FITGRIP is been offered on the 9 most popular Cavitron inserts and has had great acceptance to date.", "Within our endodontic business, we launched ProTaper Gold in North America at the end of the first quarter. Gold is an extension to our market-leading ProTaper endodontic power [ph] brand and utilizes a patented heat treatment process, which creates a gold hue. The process provides greater flexibility to negotiate canal anatomy and also significantly increases resistance to cyclical fatigue or file separation. We are early in the launch, but customer acceptance has gone well, and we now begin to roll the product out on a global basis.", "Finally, one of the more innovative new products in the endodontic portfolio is true-shape [ph], a new endodontic 3D conforming instrument, which provides traditional root canal preparation while promoting dentin preservation. true-shape [ph] has a unique shape and a highly flexible design, which removes less dentin and maintains the integrity of the tooth structure. true-shape [ph] is the first product in our true platform, which will be a series of products focused on dentin preservation.", "From an operational perspective, we announced the consolidation of our Sultan health care business based in Englewood, New Jersey to DENTSPLY professional division in York, Pennsylvania. This follows an earlier announcement of the consolidation of our RINN division in Elgin, Illinois to the professional division in Q1.", "The purpose of these moves is to create a single preventive and infection control business, leverage operational R&D and SG&A resources and market the consolidated portfolio globally to our intracompany locations.", "In the U.S., our Sultan sales force will remain independent, but the RINN x-ray position accessory products will be managed by our hygiene sales force, providing additional sales resources to support these brands.", "Also in Q2, we completed the consolidation of our materialized dental operation, which provide implant treatment planning software and surgical guides based in Lugano [ph] , Belgium, which is been consolidated into Es Healthcare [ph] based in Hasselt, Belgium, which produces implant-retained bars and bridges. This follows the integration of various materialized dental country organizations into the respective DENTSPLY implants location. These moves are part of a broader strategy to create a fully integrated digital implant portfolio and are consistent with our efforts to increase asset utilization and improve return on those assets.", "I'd now like to turn it over to Chris Clark.", "Christopher T. Clark", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to provide some detail on our financial performance for the second quarter, including our efforts to improve operating margin, cash flow, and asset utilization.", "For the second quarter, sales excluding precious metals grew 2.1% compared to prior year with constant currency growth of 30 basis points and favorable currency translation of 180 basis points.", "Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the quarter was 58.5% of sales, excluding precious metals, which represents an improvement of 10 basis points over the last year's second quarter.", "I would note that currency moved against us in the gross profit line in the quarter by approximately 30 basis points, so our underlying gross profit rate performance on a constant currency basis was stronger than reported.", "SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 39.2% of sales, excluding precious metals, consistent with our SG&A rate in the second quarter of 2013.", "Operating margin for the quarter improved by 10 basis points to 19.3% of sales, excluding precious metals on adjusted basis. That compares to 19.2% in the second quarter of last year. As we mentioned on our first quarter call, we knew that last year's strong operating margin rate would be a difficult baseline for us this quarter, so we're quite pleased with our operating margin performance.", "I would add that currency was a headwind of the operating margin rate of -- by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter as well.", "In addition, we invested approximately another 20 basis points of operating margin back into the business in cost to accelerate our operating margin improvement efforts moving forward.", "Over the past 4 quarters, adjusted operating margins has improved by 60 basis points compared to the prior 12-month period. So we continue to be quite pleased with our progress in this area and believe that we're on track towards our objective of reaching a 20% adjusted operating margin rate in 2017. Our reported and operating tax rates for the second quarter were both 22.4%. As anticipated, tax represented a bit of a headwind in the quarter if the operating tax rate was 40 basis points, above our 22.0% rate in the second quarter last year.", "Year-to-date, our operating tax rate of 22.5% is a 60-basis-point headwind the last year's rate and that's consistent with the guidance we provided for the year.", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as-reported basis in the second quarter was $90 million or $0.62 per diluted share. That compares to $87.2 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2013.", "These results include a number of items, which we listed in the schedules in the release.", "On an adjusted basis, net earnings grew to $99.7 million from $95.8 million in the prior-year quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 4.6% to $0.69 per diluted share, and that compares to $0.66 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year.", "Despite the currency headwind to the operating margin rate in the quarter, the overall impact of currency on earnings for the quarter was neutral to slightly positive, less than $0.01 per share, due largely to the favorable impact of currency translation on both sales and earnings.", "Year-to-date, currency remains a slight headwind to earnings. And while rates are pretty volatile presently, at current rates, we would anticipate the currency impact on earnings over the next 2 quarters to be minimal.", "Moving on to cash flow. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was $155.7 million, which represents a 60% increase over last year's $97 million. This represents a record quarterly cash flow for the second quarter for the company. For the first half of 2014, our operating cash flow 22.2 -- I'm sorry, $220.2 million represents an increase of $88.4 million over prior year, which is a 67% increase.", "We continue to focus on driving better cash management and are benefiting in particular from some of the tax strategies implemented, as well as lower investments in working capital compared to prior year.", "With respect to working capital, inventories now stand at 123 days, which is up 3 days compared to March and up 7 days compared to prior year. As we mentioned on several previous earnings calls, we have strategically increased inventory in a few businesses as part of transition plans associated with anticipated operational changes.", "We expect inventory to now begin to decrease in the back half of 2014 and through 2015 as we gradually return to more normal levels. Accounts receivable days were 59 days at the end of June. That's down 2 days from March and flat to prior-year June. Capital expenditures were $24 million in the quarter, while depreciation was $21 million and amortization was $13 million.", "Net debt improved by over $112 million in the quarter. And our net debt-to-capitalization ratio now stands at 33.5% compared to 39.3% a year ago, and 51.3% right after the Astra Tech acquisition.", "In the quarter, the company also repurchased just under 300,000 shares of common stock, bringing our year-to-date total to just under 1.2 million shares.", "In terms of our capital deployment approach, I want to reiterate that our attempt is to continue to support repaying debt while also balancing uses of free cash flow to support reinvesting in the business, acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends. So really a balanced approach.", "Finally, as Bret stated, based on our first half results, as well as our current view of the relevant market factors, we are maintaining our adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $2.47 to $2.55. This reflects a number of pluses and minuses that we've outlined this morning, including a somewhat tempered view of market conditions as Bret noted, as well as more challenging prior-year earnings growth comparison in the second half than what we ran against in the first half.", "We are also factoring in the momentum, we believe, we are creating relative to our efforts to improve operating efficiency and to drive better leverage of our cost and asset basis.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your support, and we'd now be glad to answer any questions you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jeff Johnson at Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Bret, just wanted to start with you on some of your market comments, and I think the way you're seeing the market is very similar to what we've been seeing the market here in our checks and survey work over the last month or 2 of maybe a little bit of incremental softness in June and what have you. But as the GDP number comes out 4% for the second quarter. Employment seems to be picking up, maybe you've been seeing some wage inflation here picking up a little bit, which would be helpful probably from a spending standpoint. What do you think is causing kind of this sluggishness at this dental market level versus what seems to be at least in the domestic, trends a little bit strengthening on the macro side?", "Bret W. Wise", "Thanks, Jeff. And that is an important question. We did see the GDP report yesterday, which was quite encouraging for the second quarter. And obviously, dental's a trailing indicators, so if we see strong GDP growth, generally speaking, history would tell us that dental will be picked up on a couple of quarter lag behind that. Year-to-date GDP is not so great. It's only up 0.9%. I think through the middle of the year, and obviously, was depressed in the first quarter for all the comments -- the reasons we know about weather, et cetera. But seemed to pick up in the second quarter. And if so, then again, I would expect to see dental improve. It just hasn't improved yet. On the employment numbers, at the surface, those are also very encouraging. I mean, we saw 288,000 jobs added in June. When you peel that back one layer, the truth is they added -- we added about 800,000 part-time jobs and lost 500,000 full-time jobs. And, of course, the full-time jobs generally have benefits and the part-time don't. So I think we have to watch those numbers a little more carefully and understand what the nature of the jobs are. And generally speaking, if you track white-collar job growth, it tracks pretty close to dental growth. And so that's the factor we're trying to watch. So I didn't mean to be entirely negative on the growth outlook, because we still believe -- or I still believe that the dental markets are going to start pickup particularly if we see some economic growth like we saw in the second quarter. If that continues to play out, I think we'll see an improvement over the next couple of quarters.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, understood. Helpful. And then as I look at the organic growth number this quarter, I compared to maybe one of your larger competitors on the manufacture side. They don't give exact details, but it sounds like their consumables business is up low-single-digits in the quarter. We haven't heard yet from the distributors. My sense is their consumables numbers might be just to touch stronger than your organic growth was not by much, but maybe some. Talk to me maybe a little bit about your share and kind of how you feel like DENTSPLY is competing here against some of the others out there?", "Bret W. Wise", "Okay. Well, the data points we have so far is one competitor came out with 2% dental, but said equipment was the growth factor and consumables were less than that. I don't think they gave the exact number, but I implied it was flat. Their consumable number must have been flat based on what they said. We have the industry data through May, which would tell us and chair-side consumables were actually gaining share. And we do have a drag from lab. We've got -- that's a business that's under repair, we have work to do there. If asked directly, are we losing share in lab, I'd say, yes. The rest of businesses are mixed. We have some very good performance in the everyday dentistry products, some very good product launches. Jim mentioned a few of those. I think we have some upside there. In the specialty business, implants in particular, I think could be an upside with this new product launch. We have to watch that closely. And so overall, I think it is a mixed bag. I don't think we're beating the market by a lot, but I don't think the market is really robust right now either. And the data points you mentioned we need. We need to see what the dealer report for Q2, and then we'll know more firmly what the market is.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes. Understood. Last question and then just, Jim, any chance you could quantify some of the liquidation you were seeing -- you mentioned on the inventory side with the EV launch? Where is that happening in U.S. versus Europe? If you could quantify it at all, maybe what that implicate might imply for the second half of the year, if some channel inventory has to get rebuilt, things like that?", "James G. Mosch", "Yes, Jeff. So I think the -- what we've seen is that -- the 2 markets we went into, we went into the United States, Canada and then select European markets. And one of the phenomena as you see when you launch a new implant system is obviously the customer has to go a transition process. They are -- they need to buy a new surgical kit. They're being judicious about their implant purchases based on what they think they might place going forward. Where they are fairly aggressive is in their abutment stocks. And they recognize that they're not going to be producing these -- they are not going to be placing these going forward. So they significantly reduce their abutment inventories, and we've definitely seen that. I think one of the other -- I think maybe it's a positive phenomena, which is that transition to a new implant system is not insignificant for a surgeon. And we would expect that if 4 to -- if we contact 10 oral surgeons, 4 out of 5 would want to make a conversion immediately. And in fact, I think the success of this system is it's more or like 8 out of 10. So that's kind of put some additional pressure on both the capacity standpoint, as well as the inventory impact. We have addressed that issue, and we are prepared for full launch in the back half of the year, particularly in the United States. And we expect growth from that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.", "Nathan Allen Rich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "This is actually Nathan Rich on for Bob, today. First, I just wanted to dive into little bit more detail on what you saw in Europe in the quarter. I think internal growth was pretty consistent with the first quarter. But was wondering if you could comment on Western Europe specifically and how that perform relative to the first quarter? And just any update on your expectation for what you expect in Europe in the back half of the year?", "Bret W. Wise", "Okay. Yes, this is Bret. Like I mentioned, we are down 1.3%, I think, in Europe in the quarter, which is kind of, as you know, is kind of consistent what we would have been seeing. CIF continued to be a drag there, but it was a little bit less than a drag than it was in the first quarter. For Western Europe, we were still down slightly, less than 1%, obviously, in the quarter and it's a mixed bag. We've got some countries in the south that are growing, some that are stable, some that are slightly contracting. Even in North is a mixed bag at this point. U.K. is a growth market. And as I mentioned it looks good, whereas France was pretty weak, et cetera. Germany was kind of flattish. So I don't really have a lot more colors on that other than to say overall, the trends don't seem to be changing much. They seem to be consistent with what we've seen before. There are moves in individual countries, but overall the region is performing about as it has been.", "Nathan Allen Rich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And then also just -- very impressive SG&A control in the quarter. And it sounds like you're planning to kind of accelerate your efforts in terms of achieving your long-term operating margin goal. I'm just wondering if you could go into a little bit more detail on how you're able to control expenses in the quarter. Maybe any specific initiatives that you're exceeding plan on? And then how should we think about how the cost savings ramp not only in the back half of this year but also into 2015?", "Bret W. Wise", "Okay. I'm going to take a stab at that. And then Chris may have some additional comments. One of the things we commented on is that we've been building inventory ahead of some operational initiatives. Jim commented on several of those in his prepared remarks today. Those are evidence of the types of moves that we have been making and will be making. I don't know that I would describe it as that we're accelerating the efforts. The plan we have is a very balanced plan, well-thought-out plan. And the idea is to reduce the fixed cost structure burden on the businesses, so they have more variable spent to invest in growth, and that's what we've been doing. So like I said, it's not that we are going faster than we were thinking we are going to go. We are going at about the rate we thought we would go, and this is a multiyear long-term initiative to improve the profitability of the business and the return on assets. Now, Chris, I said a lot. Is there anything you'd like to add to that?", "Christopher T. Clark", "No, I think that's accurate. I mean, again, I think you'll continue to see us provide some insights in terms of the specific actions and strategies as we take them. And obviously, we'll continue to provide those insights on the call. And I would say that this quarter is pretty consistent with what we've been doing. We're very focused on driving SG&A leverage. We're very focused on driving better asset utilization across our plants, having our teams work far more closely together. And that drives the benefits that we're seeing. So again, we're pleased with the performance, but it's -- we'll continue to execute those strategies and as we have larger events or notable events our strategies that are central to that, we'll provide comments on those as we implement those.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "A couple of businesses that we didn't spend much time on in the prepared remarks. I'm wondering if you could help us out a bit on, number one is implants. Could you give us a sense of how the growth there tracked? Any perspective on the market and regional trends would be really helpful.", "Bret W. Wise", "Yes, Steve. As far as our implant business, growth in Q2 was up low-single-digits. On a constant currency basis, we were slightly negative. We continue to see growth in North America. Europe did contract, and Rest of World was up in spite of a pretty big pullback in Japan that we saw in Q2. I did mention in my prepared remarks we have seen some impacts as it relates to the inventory liquidation. That was particularly true in North America. We've only had 2 companies report thus far, they're between minus 1%, plus 2%. We feel we're in that range, and quite frankly, our focus now is really on the launch of EV which we think will support as [ph] well in second half of the year. Our digital business continues to perform very well.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I am sorry if I missed, but did you attempt to quantify the liquidation impact on the quarter? It sounds like relative to the market, order of magnitude may be a point?", "Bret W. Wise", "That's kind of difficult to do. I mean, it's across a lot of customers. So your -- we don't have obviously access to inventory at the customer levels. So it's really difficult to measure that magnitude.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And then I wonder if you could spend a minute on the health care business, the non-dental piece of the business? As I reflect that on your comments, Bret, about the performance of dental in North America. I was hoping that you could give us a little color there to help us put together the rest of the puzzle for the full U.S. line?", "Bret W. Wise", "Just for clarity, Steve, you want more color on the non-dental piece or on the dental piece?", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "The non-dental, sorry.", "Bret W. Wise", "Okay, non-dental is, for us, is made up of our Wellspect HealthCare business, which performed quite well in the quarter. But also some, let's call them legacy industrial lines dating back -- in this case, dating back anywhere from 15 to 30 years. Acquisitions, we've done over very long period of time. There's not a wide variety of products in that category anymore. Those kind of have slowly been faced out of the portfolio, but in this case, we had one particular product that was produced, generally speaking, for just one customer as a raw material for them to go into their product line. And it hadn't been in a product line that had been growing or investing in. But that customer decided to in source that product line. And so it's basically gone now from our portfolio or will be phased out over the next couple of quarters. So I -- this is a non-core issue. I don't think we need to spend a lot of time on it. But this is just one of those small items that were sitting in the portfolio that now is going to be gone.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And the legacy Astra health care business?", "Bret W. Wise", "The legacy Astra health care business is the Wellspect business that I mentioned that performed very well during the quarter and continues to be a really bright spot in the portfolio, so it's a business we like a lot.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Erin Wilson with Bank of America.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "On capital deployment, do you anticipate any sort of change in strategy on the M&A front specifically in light of Nobel [ph] on the block more recently? And broadly speaking, I guess 5 years down the road, what businesses really make sense for you?", "Bret W. Wise", "Thanks Erin. I am going to take a stab at that and Chris may have some color to add as well. Our strategy is to find technologies or companies or brands that improves the portfolio of the company and make those investments. We are a, I would call us an aggressive acquirer where there is value to be had from strategic standpoint. Most likely in dental, that's going to be smaller tuck-under acquisitions. We've made a lifetime career out of doing small tuck-under acquisitions, we think we're pretty good at it. Timing is always a problem or always an issue, because these are primarily health companies, et cetera. With respect to larger targets, I don't want to comment on any one target in particular, but as you know, we've considered larger targets before and actually have transacted larger targets for the right strategic reasons. From a capital deployment strategy standpoint, our first priority is to reinvest in the business and innovation in sales and marketing, clinical education, all those sort of things, which can grow the business organically. Our second priority is the balance between continued debt reduction, which you've seen is to recently pretty well I think. Share buyback -- or acquisitions where we can do it would be the next priority followed by share buybacks and dividends. I don't think those priorities have changed. We'd still probably put acquisitions at a higher priority than share buybacks. Although we're committed to holding the share count neutral or decreasing it each year as we move forward. So particularly given where our debt structured is today. Chris, do you have.", "Christopher T. Clark", "Nothing. You hit it.", "Bret W. Wise", "Okay. So that's where we stand on capital deployment strategy.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And how much would you say new product launches are contributing year-to-date? And should we expect more meaningful contribution from new product launches in 2015?", "Bret W. Wise", "New product launches are, as they always do, contribute. There's always amount of cannibalization because we're generally launching, for the most part, in categories where we already have some product lines. We are just trying to improve the practice of dentistry in that product line. I don't have a great -- I don't really have a good quantified estimate for you for the impact on new product launches. We did have several key products that launched in the last 6 months. Jim noted those. We have a pipeline going forward that looks like it could be a little heavy on the back half than it was in the first half. But product launches and new products is a fundamental part of our strategy that's important to the internal growth to continue growth of the company. Sorry I don't have a better quantification for you at this time. But I just don't have that at hand.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Matt Baxo [ph] with William Blair.", "Unknown Analyst", "So, I guess my question is to get your 20% operating margin by 2017, how much is that predicated on the market actually growing? Or can you basically get there from current growth rates on the top line?", "Bret W. Wise", "Well, that's a tough question. It will be a lot easier if the market's growing, that's for sure. The plans that we've laid out would allow us to get to that number, not totally irrespective of market growth, but including a period when market growth was lower than historical norms. So I don't want to say we can get every 0 market growth, because I think that would be tough. But the plan is laid out for -- as such that we can get there without the market returning to the 4% to 6% growth the we had enjoyed pre-recession, and the fundamentals of the plan are that it would allow the business to really enjoy some prosperity if in fact -- with these actions if in fact the market did return to that level.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And also I know you guys have mentioned earlier in the year that you were closing a few plants to increase utilization capacity and stuff like that. How far along are you in that process and when do you expect that to end?", "Bret W. Wise", "That's a long-term program. The comments that Jim made today were the ones that we've taken, thus far. I think there are 3 actions that's been taken so thus far. There'll be more of that, because we need to do some consolidation. We need to increase capacity utilization and become more effective on the cost side. But that's going to be a multiyear program where we improve efficiency of the business. It's not a quick rifle shot.", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes, Matt [ph] , it's Chris. I think again, the same comment earlier holds as we take those actions, we'll provide perspective on those obviously as we move forward. And the perspective of that point as well in terms of what we should need for us.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to Jon Block with Stifel.", "Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Maybe first one, Bret. We've been speaking with the threat of value or generic implants for a while and it's always tough to give numbers but one of your competitors at a recent Analyst Day gave out sort of high, maybe a mid-teen growth rate for their value offerings. We've seen some of your premium competitors sort of repositioned themselves to at least have a hand in value from an equity state [ph] . Can you talk big picture how you see the implant market is sort of shaping out of the high-end and to the low end of the next 2 to 3 years. And do you guys need to do anything to reposition yourselves to capture growth?", "Bret W. Wise", "John, a couple comments. There certainly is a lower price, or I think you used the word, \"generic\" implant market. It's not our focus. We're more focused on advancing the science. This is a very risky part of dentistry. I just actually had a dental implant done 2 months ago, and I now know personally that it's quite an event. So our focus is on advancing the science and advancing the practice of dentistry. We're just launching a new premium implant that comes at a price premium. The market acceptance has been tremendous and so we can see that the clinicians and the patients are willing to pay for value. On the other hand, we don't dismiss the fact that there is this lower-priced generic segment. We think it's much -- could be as much as $1.5 billion market now. So it's not one to be dismissed. We're tracking very closely what's happening in that market. We think that profitability is generally low for most companies that are participating in that segment. Not all companies, but most companies. We've tracked over the last, I think, 3 or 4 years, 28 companies in that market, 19 of which have now gone out of business. And so there's been others that have come into that market. So we are very in-tuned to what's happening in that part of the market. We did make a small investment 4, 5 years ago in a low-cost implant player in South Korea. We're considering our options there. But we have nothing really else to communicate to the market at this time.", "Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Very helpful and maybe just a follow up. In terms of who may or may not for sale there, can you speak to may be, Bret, how it could impact you guys if you were to go to this rumored sale to a player that's currently one of the top 1, 3, 4, excuse me, #1 players out there or private equity? I guess where I'm going with this is, when you guys did Astra Tech, do you see a chance -- a greater chance to pick up share as one of the leaders were to make a move for the company that's for sale versus it just going to private equity?", "Bret W. Wise", "That's hard to answer obviously, because we're speculating on who could be involved in any single transaction. I think that acquisitions cause disruption and disruption sometimes creates opportunity for competitors. And we just went through that. So we're watching it very closely. We do know that out of the top 5, 2 of those are merging now or have plans to merge, which will cause some disruption. And the latest rumors about another top player in the market could further cause disruption. But it's hard for me to speculate about the nature of the disruption and how we would react without knowing exactly what transactions were going to transpire.", "Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And lastly for me real quick. Chris, I think when we started off the year, you mentioned FX headwinds of about $0.04. Is that where we are? Are we closer to $0.02 or $0.03? Can you just -- I guess clean that up as we sit here today?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes, I mean, obviously we're bouncing around the fair amount, so we're going to -- it's tough to pin it down to specific number. The building blocks we give you was we were about $0.02 negative in the first quarter. We're neutral to slightly positive. You should think less than $0.01 or share in the second quarter. And if rates stay where they are right now, then it's going to be pretty well neutral for the last 2 quarters, pretty much a nonevent. Now that said, there's a lot of pluses and minuses within that. We'll get some help from the euro, the second-tier basket of currencies are still really -- they're down 7.5% compared to a year ago on a year-to-date basis. So again, there's a lot of movement at this stage of the game. But if you take a look at a snapshot, it would be the best perspective I could give you.", "Operator", "And we have time for one more question. We'll go next to Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.", "Brandon Couillard", "Bret, could you speak to the endo and ortho businesses? Any changes or developments that you've seen in those markets globally or regionally?", "Bret W. Wise", "Sure, Brandon. First on ortho, I think we've commented on that, please from our perspective, that's probably the most competitive market in dentistry right now. I mean, there's excess capacity that's been added that market. There's price pressure. We're still focused on technology and bringing new products to market, and recovering from the product supply outage that we had a couple of years ago. So there's a lot of pressure in that market and ortho is not a growth market for us at this point. Endo, on the other hand, we're a leader in endo in technology. We're -- we continue to grow nicely in that category. We're bringing new products to market. Jim commented on some of those this morning. So endo remains a bright spot for us in our overall portfolio.", "Brandon Couillard", "Chris, on the cash flow front, any chance you could quantify the magnitude of the inventory opportunity or wind down in the back half of the year? And should we think absolute inventory levels being declining on a dollar basis in '15?", "Christopher T. Clark", "Yes. So again, I think, Brandon, we -- the word I'd give you would be \"gradual\" in terms of the movement. I'm not going to put an inventory target out there for this fiscal year for us. But of course, I would say that I would be disappointed if we don't continue to gradually improve here. There may be a quarter up or quarter down. But in short, we should be gradually moving this. So as we look at our inventory levels right now, 123 days compared to historically where we were if you go back in 2, 3 years ago. The fact is, they're up a number of days. And again our objective is to gradually bring these down. We expect to make some progress by yearend. We expect to make more progress through '15. And then obviously, we think we'd probably still have some room to grow after that. And again, this is a longer term focus area. There's -- we'll be burning down some of the transitional stock that we built. But we think that beyond that, there's some movements we can take, actions we can take to continue to improve, frankly, the overall inventory efficiency and asset efficiency in the inventory line for us.", "Bret W. Wise", "And Brandon, this is Bret. I'd just add to that, that there's lot -- I would say more focus on this issue internally than we've had in sometime in a number of years. So this is an area that, strategically, we want to get at.", "Operator", "And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.", "Derek W. Leckow", "Okay. Thank you all very much for your interest in DENTSPLY. That concludes our conference call. If you have more questions, I'm available today for follow-up. Goodbye.", "Operator", "And again, that does conclude today's conference.

At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "Derek Leckow ", "Thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International\u2019s third quarter 2014 results. I\u2019m joined by Bret Wise, DENTSPLY\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Mosch, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. I hope you had a chance to review our press release issued earlier this morning. I\u2019d like to point out that a copy of the release and a set of supplemental slides and information relating to non-GAAP financials are available for download in the investor relation\u2019s section of our website www.DENTSPLY.com under the heading events and presentation.", "I\u2019d like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language and US GAAP reconciliation contained in today\u2019s press release also pertains to this conference call. We may make forward-looking statements regarding risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in the release and in our SEC filings. It is possible that the actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make today.", "The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the day of this call. A recording of this call in its entirety will be available on our website. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Bret Wise.", "Bret W. Wise ", "I\u2019m going to start with a few observations on the market and our own performance and then hand it off to Jim and Chris for more details. Starting with the markets, overall we would say that the global dental consumable markets are stable, not accelerating a lot at this point but also with a few notable exceptions, no real slowing. The US market is showing some signs of life, particularly in chair side consumables which may be picking up a bit. That\u2019s important because this is a very large category with many industry participants and frankly, it\u2019s an area where we\u2019re having a very good year.", "In Europe, Q3 is of course, a tough benchmark because of the summer holiday period tends to be a one month quarter, but we would say that generally we\u2019ve seen some slight improvements with notable exception of the CIS region Russia and Ukraine are still quite negative. But ex CIS we saw modest improvements across a broad range of countries and a broad range of products throughout Europe. This was a broader kind of improvement than we\u2019ve seen for some time in Europe and we realize this is a bit contrary to the recent economic news coming out of the region so it\u2019s not clear whether this is indicative of a broader market trend or simply an improvement of our own performance over this period of time.", "Rest of world continues to be a mixed bag, looks pretty strong in Asia and the Middle East. Australia seems to be better despite a significant weakening of the currency while Brazil remains slow and Japan remained modestly negative, I think still suffering a bit from the excise tax hangover that occurred in March. But overall, we would say there\u2019s no big news in the market conditions one way or the other. Pretty stable conditions throughout the globe. ", "For our own performance, internal growth picked up a bit in the quarter. We were up 2.4% and we were positive in all of the US, Europe, and rest of world. Overall, we had sales growth ex PM of 1.8%, that was helped mostly by the internal growth which I mentioned was 2.4% and acquisitions added a modest 0.6% so constant currency was 3.0% in the quarter. Currency translation was more negative than when we entered the quarter, we ended up down 1.2% because of currency so constant currency 3.0%, negative currency 1.2% yields the 1.8% growth.", "Internal growth was 2.0% in the US, was positive 1.0% in Europe and interestingly, it was up 2.4% without CIS in Europe. As I mentioned, that\u2019s a pretty notable improvement. Internal growth in rest of world regions was 5.9%, that was led by strong performance in the emerging market countries. Growth by category and these are global categories was strongest in the chairside consumables followed by the dental specialties and medical while lab continued to be slightly negative driven by weakness in Europe.", "On operational execution we continued to implement changes to improve our margins in this low growth environment. We saw good market expansion for the third quarter running. We were up 80 basis points this quarter and at this point we\u2019re also up 80 basis points in the year-to-date area so pretty consistent margin improvement throughout the year. This gives us an adjusted EPS growth of just under 9% in the quarter which is up nicely against a 12% EPS growth, that\u2019s adjusted EPS growth in the third quarter last year. So we were up against a reasonably tough base period. Adjusted EPS is also up 8.5% to 9% for the year-to-date, so through nine months.", "When we entered the year we had stated that margin expansion and improving asset turns were important objectives for this year while continuing to invest in future growth initiatives. I think the margin expansion that we see here is good evidence that we\u2019re making strong progress on margins while asset management has also been quiet strong with operating cash flows growing close to 40% year-to-date. We\u2019re pleased with these results given the low growth environment. We believe the actions we\u2019re taking today will facilitate stronger earnings growth even in a low growth environment like we\u2019re in today but much higher earnings growth when markets return to more normal growth rates.", "We\u2019re moving forward on a number of fronts to improve the operational execution. This quarter we announced that we\u2019re in talks with the Works Council in Germany to improve the performance of the European lab business. This initiative will become more clear over the next couple of quarters based on the progression of those discussions. Another area of emphasis is consolidating or reducing certain product lines and eliminating SKUs where it\u2019s optimal to our operating performance. This will likely result in our discontinuing some low margin product lines but also will result in improved asset returns and returns on invested capital. We\u2019ll update you more on that as we move through the fourth quarter here and into next year.", "Of course with a strong cash flow comes improvements in our balance sheet giving us more flexibility for external investments such as acquisitions and also returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends, and Chris is going to speak more to that. So, as we execute three we\u2019re updating our earnings guidance for the full year to adjusted EPS of $2.49 to $2.53. We have some very good opportunities but also some significant currency and tax headwinds in the fourth quarter and also some cost headwinds based on some reinvestment plans that we have and Chris will give you more on that in a moment.", "As far as 2015, we\u2019re going to defer discussing or giving guidance on 2015 until we report our fourth quarter and the full year results and that\u2019s the normal schedule that we follow, so we\u2019ll give that to you in February. That concludes my prepared remarks, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Jim now for some operational comments. ", "James G. Mosch ", "I\u2019d like to provide a brief perspective on a few operational items and then turn it over to Chris for the financial review. As indicated previously, we have undertaken several initiatives to improve our operating performance. In September, we announced that we had proposed steps to reorganize elements of our German laboratory business and the associated manufacturing capabilities. We are seeking to realign our portfolio of laboratory products with increased focus on innovative prosthetic materials while deemphasizing the [inaudible] the business. As required under German law, the company has entered into a statutory co-determination process with the appropriate labor groups. ", "Last quarter we outlined the consolidation of our RINN and Sultan divisions into DENTSPLY\u2019s professional based in York Pennsylvania. Our objective was two-fold, first to create a global preventative and infection control business and second, to drive operating efficiencies. In October, this consolidation was completed, operations have been transferred and the new structure is now operational. ", "It\u2019s important to note that on a year-to-date basis, both of these businesses are growing above market, both Sultan and RINN and the RINN business in particular has benefitted from additional sales focus from the professional division. This is important given that as we go through a restructuring that we maintain topline growth. ", "In addition to above, we have also launched a global strategic sourcing initiative. We recognize that given the nature of our global business with multiple manufacturing facilities and distribution locations, we have created a complex supply chain environment. While we\u2019re at the very early stages, we believe that there are significant opportunities for improvement in both asset management and cost reduction.", "Turning to the performance of our business groups, we are pleased with the performance of our consumable business specific to restorative and preventative and infection control portfolios. In both portfolios we are growing above market and increasing market share. Restoratives has benefitted from a string of new products such as TPH Spectra, Aquasil Cordless, prime and bond elect, and smartlite. These products in combination with the market leading SDR bulk-fill composite, and the palodent plus matrix system has supported an innovative marketing campaign focused on Class II restorations, one of the most commonly used procedures in dentistry. This is resonating positively with clinicians. ", "Similarly our preventative and infection control business has also grown by entering new categories with products such as new pro fluoride varnish and new pro freedom cordless prophy system and the expanding of leading brand portfolios such as Cavitron and Sultan. ", "Our lab business has been challenged after a decade long decline of precious metal alloys. Although this decline has slowed and maybe near bottom. With this, we see some good opportunities to meet the needs of our lab customers by improving our traditional lab portfolio and providing a broader suite of next generation materials and digital services that help our customers perform their work more efficiently and better outcomes for the end customers and their patients. ", "Turning to our implant business, it has improved sequentially as competency and effectiveness continues to improve at the field level. In the quarter, implants grew mid-single digits on a constant currency basis in line with the overall implant market. Growth has been driving by the launch of the Astra Tech implant system and double digit growth of our digital implant portfolio. In the quarter we saw all three regions: US; Europe; and rest of world show growth in our implant business. ", "We anticipate that XiVE will continue to fuel growth as we further penetrate the larger markets. To-date the feedback has been very positive and the conversion rate is greater than anticipated. In addition one-third of the conversions are coming from new customers. ", "In regards to new products our Midwest division which markets and manufacturers high and low speed dental hand pieces and dental burs launched the Midwest E Electric handpiece at the recent ADA. The new electric handpiece has several unique features which allow our Midwest business compete in the important and growing electric handpiece segment. This is a category where we have not been competitive in a meaningful way historically so we believe there is a good potential for this product line addition.", "While the Midwest business is a market leader in dental handpiece and the bur business in North America, it is not widely marketed outside this region with the earlier launch of the Midwest automated handpiece station and now Midwest E we plan to further develop Midwest into a global business. ", "As we enter Q4 we will launch several new products. First TRUSHAPE, a new endodontic file system which is a shape adjusting file that preserves dentin and supports the emerging trend of minimal invasive dentistry. This is a new approach endodontics and as the market leader we believe we are well positioned to demonstrate its clinical effectiveness. ", "Second, we\u2019ve launched a new guided surgery kit for the Astra Tech ED implant system. This is based off our market leading Simplant guided surgery system and will further support the launch of the Astra Tech ED System. Finally Miyabi, Miyabi high strength composite intended for the fabrication of anterior crowns. This is an additional indication for the potential in innovation in non-metal crown and bridge materials which is a key focus of our prosthetics business. Miyabi has been recently approved for the Japanese public market and is in launch with excellent acceptance.", "I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Chris Clark for the financial review. ", "Christopher T. Clark ", "I\u2019d like to provide some detail on our financial performance for the third quarter including our efforts to improve operating margin, cash flow, and asset utilization. As Bret mentioned, internal sales growth in the quarter accelerated from the levels we saw in Q2 both globally and in all three major geographic regions with the US growth particularly notable given the 4.3% growth in base line in last year\u2019s third quarter.", "Our results included combined headwinds of about 75 basis points from a discontinued non-core non-dental product in the US that was insourced by a customer and also from ongoing headwinds from Russia CIS. Consistent with previous years, we implemented price increases across many of our businesses effective October 1st. We estimate the pricing impact to be generally similar to previous years, although in a lower interest rate environment we believe customers may have pulled forward a modest level of incremental purchases in advance of the pricing change. While it\u2019s difficult to quantify, we estimate this impact to have been approximately 40 to 50 basis points in sales growth in the quarter. ", "Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the quarter was 57.7% of sales excluding precious metals which represented an improvement of 110 basis points over last year\u2019s third quarter. The impact here is primarily price and mix effects in the period. SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 39.1% of sales excluding precious metals. This was 40 basis points above our run rate in Q3 2013 and reflects increased professional services spending in the quarter. ", "Operating margin for the quarter improved 80 basis points to 18.7% of sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis and that compares to 17.9% in the third quarter last year. I would add that currency was a slight headwind to operating margin in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with our operating margin improvement as adjusted operating margin for the first nine months of 2014 is up by 80 basis points over prior year despite a 30 basis point headwind from currency over that period. ", "We believe that we are solidly on track towards our objective of reaching a 20% adjusted operating margin rate in 2017 and believe our margin improvement strategies are gaining traction. Jim spoke to a number of the initiatives here so I won\u2019t repeat those but I do want to comment while progress towards the 20% goal will not be linear, we are very much on track against the objectives and we\u2019ll continue to provide perspective on key events and strategies as we move forward.", "Our reported tax rate for the third quarter was 21.8% and our operating tax rate was 22.8% for the quarter. As anticipated tax represented a bit of a headwind in the quarter as the operating tax rate was 70 basis points above our 22.1% rate in the third quarter last year. Year-to-date our operating tax rate of 22.6% is a 60 basis point headwind to last year\u2019s rate. That\u2019s consistent with the guidance that we provided for the year. I should also note that this is also consistent with what we expect for the operating tax rate in the fourth quarter which will be a negative comparison of last year\u2019s fourth quarter tax rate by about 180 basis points. ", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as reported basis in the third quarter was $75.3 million or $0.52 per diluted share and that compares to $79.9 million or $0.55 per diluted share in the third quarter 2013. These results include a number of items which we\u2019ve listed in the schedules in the press release. On an adjusted basis, net earnings grew to $89.3 million from $82.2 million in the prior year quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 8.8% to $0.62 per diluted share compared to $0.57 per diluted share in the third quarter last year.", "While we commented on the Q2 earnings call that then current rates would have minimal impact on earnings for the second half of the year, exchange rates moved against us as the quarter progressed with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro being particularly acute. As a result earnings in the third quarter were negatively impacted by currency by approximately $0.01 per share. While rates are highly volatile at present, we anticipated currency being a headwind in fourth quarter earnings by about $0.02 per share as we enter the quarter with a euro rate that was 7% weaker versus the US dollar compared to the prior year. ", "Moving onto cash flow, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $147.5 million which represents a 17% increase over last year\u2019s $126.5 million. This represents a record third quarter cash flow performance for the company, as our third straight quarterly record. For the first nine months of 2013, our operating cash flow of $367.8 million represents an increase of $109.5 million over prior year which is a 42% increase. ", "Our free cash flow yield has increased to well above 6% on a trailing 12 months basis. We continue to focus on driving better cash conversion and while we\u2019re pleased with the progress we continue to see opportunities to improve them even further moving forward as we continue to drive working capital improvements.", "With respect to working capital, I had commented previously that after strategically increasing inventories for several quarters to support anticipated operational changes, we anticipated that inventories would start to decline in the second half of the year and then gradually return to more normal levels. We are executing to that plan as inventories dropped by four days sequentially in the quarter and now stand at 119 days on a constant currency basis compared to 123 days at the end of June and 118 days last September.", "Account receivable days were 62 days at the end of September down two days from last year and up sequentially. Capital expenditures were $24 million in the quarter while depreciation was $21 million and amortization was $13 million. We anticipate cap ex to be approximately $110 million for the year and this reflects incremental investments in initiatives to support our 20% operating margin goal including continued investment in our common ERP platform initiative. ", "Net debt improved by over $117 million in the quarter and our net debt to capitalization ratio now stands at 32.2% compared to 35.8% a year ago and 48.2% right after the Astra Tech acquisition. Given our rapid deleveraging of strong cash flow, we view capital deployment as a catalyst moving forward with focus on reinvestment in growth initiatives, acquisitions, and share repurchases. We remain highly engaged on the acquisition front and continue to see opportunities to strengthen the business through M&A. ", "From a share repurchase standpoint, the company repurchased approximately 345,000 shares of common stock in the quarter and that brings our year-to-date total to approximately 1.5 million shares. Through September we\u2019ve returned almost $100 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, and as I mentioned we continue to see capital deployment through both M&A and share repurchases as opportunities to accelerate value moving forward. ", "As we look to the fourth quarter we\u2019re assuming generally similar market trends to what we\u2019ve experienced recently. We\u2019re also anticipating comparative headwinds of approximately $0.05 per share as a result of the currency impact I mentioned previously, a modest contraction in channel inventories as a result of purchases ahead of the October price increase, incremental investments to support our operating margin improvement initiatives, and also the continued year-on-year headwind in our operating tax rate that actually increases in the fourth quarter. Based on these factors, we\u2019re narrowing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.49 to $2.53 for the year. ", "That completes our prepared remarks. We certainly appreciate your support and we\u2019d be glad to take any questions you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "In terms of the organic revenue growth acceleration in the quarter, can you speak to the improvements on a sequential basis? What exactly changed to go from a modest decline in Q2 to up about 2.4% in the third quarter? Could you speak to any variability you saw month-to-month through the period and particularly how you exited the quarter, especially in the US.", "Bret W. Wise ", "The improvements we saw were pretty broad across the spectrum of both countries and products. Europe in particular was broad, I mentioned that in my prepared remarks. If I had to point a finger at things that have improved from a product category basis, it would be the chairside consumables have been strong for us but continue to be particularly strong for us in the third quarter. We saw our performance in implants improve in the third quarter and again, on a regional basis we saw Europe improve pretty notably in the quarter so that\u2019s a couple items.", "I\u2019d also say the things that were dragging our performance became less of a drag in the third quarter as well. As far as improvement throughout the quarter, I\u2019m going to tell you that September was by far the best but you know, the third quarter, particularly in Europe, is a one month quarter, September is basically all you get and in this September there was an extra selling day. We were short a selling day in August but we had an extra selling day in September so we would have expected it to be strong.", "With respect to the US market, I don\u2019t know that I saw a huge variance throughout the quarter so I would say we exited the quarter at about a pace we saw throughout the quarter, not notably stronger or weaker. ", "Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Chris, I guess a two-part question for you, on the working capital front could you speak to what you perceive as the incremental near term opportunity on the inventory side? Should we expect those levels to decline on an absolute basis over the coming quarters? Secondly, without sort of getting into guidance for next year but just to give us a benchmark, at current rates can you quantify what the EPS headwind would be from currency in 2015 for us?", "Christopher T. Clark ", "Relative to working capital and specifically inventory, I mean, we commented previously that we had increased strategically inventories in advance of some operational changes and we anticipated in the second half of 2014 for that to begin to gradually come down and continue to come down in 2015. Again, as I commented, I think we\u2019re very much on that plan we came down four days sequentially in the third quarter. We\u2019re pleased with that. We would anticipate some continued progress in the fourth quarter.", "Typically our fees in terms of inventory through the year typically have this increasing inventory slightly in the first half of the year and then bringing it down. But again, I think four days coming down in a quarter is pretty strong for us. As we look at it, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate Q4 continuing to come down a bit and as we look to next year I think we\u2019ll continue to come down. We may not come down quiet as sequentially or quite to that same degree or that same rate, but we\u2019re sitting at 119 days which gives us significant opportunity yet to bring this down to a far more reasonable number.", "Regarding FX, I\u2019m not going to quantify what the FX headwind would be for next year but obviously, as we enter Q4 we see a pretty significant strengthening of the US dollar against a number of factors, a number of other currencies. I mean, against the euro we\u2019re basically \u2013 we came into the quarter about 7% stronger in terms of the dollar against the euro. That\u2019s pretty consistent among other major currencies. Obviously, we have a cash flow hedging program in place that helps to moderate that if you will or gradualize that but there\u2019s no doubt that in general a weaker dollar is certainly helpful to us relative to a stronger dollar. We\u2019ll provide more flavor on that if the rates stay where they are. In any case wherever the rates are we\u2019ll provide more flavor on that on the call in February.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Unidentified Analyst \u2013 Goldman Sachs. ", "Unidentified Analyst \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "If I could just ask on the performance you saw in implants in the quarter, definitely better than we\u2019ve seen for the last several quarters. I\u2019d just be curious to get your thoughts on how much of the improvement might have been tied to just stronger growth in the overall implant market versus what was maybe related to share gains that came with the launch of Astra Tech EV system.", "James G. Mosch ", "I would say that when we look at the overall implant market we believe that\u2019s growing at mid-single digit levels. We feel that we\u2019re in alignment with that. The performance in the various markets obviously, CIS continues to be a very significant drag. We saw improvement in Europe ex CIS probably at the best level we\u2019ve seen since the acquisition. We actually would like to think that that\u2019s a little bit better than market within Europe. As far as the rest of the geographies, I think we felt that we were pretty much in line with that. It could be a little bit stronger in North America.", "Bret W. Wise ", "I\u2019d add to that, the EV launch really took hold with full inventory in September for us in North America so we\u2019re just getting into that.", "Unidentified Analyst \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "If I could just shift gears to the efficiency initiatives that you\u2019re working on and the margin expansion that you\u2019ve seen. I\u2019d just be curious to get your thoughts on does that allow you to invest in your competitive positioning in the market and try to go after share more aggressively? Maybe overall, kind of your thoughts on investing some of these savings back into the business.", "Bret W. Wise ", "That\u2019s a great question and the program is designed to take cost out in certain elements of the business and reinvest a portion of those savings in variable spending for growth. So we are now and we will be, as we move through the next two years on the margin expansion program, redirecting some of the savings \u2013 and the margin target is a net target, it\u2019s net of the reinvestment. But we\u2019ll be reinvesting some of those savings in four or five areas that we think can facilitate stronger growth going forward. So, that is part of the program.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from [Unidentified Analyst] \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "[Unidentified Analyst] \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "You mentioned implants a few times, how did the other specialties fair in ortho in the quarter?", "Bret W. Wise ", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s a mix bag. Endo quite well, you know, we\u2019ve got a full bag of innovation both that\u2019s been launched in endo and that\u2019s coming so we\u2019re quite optimistic about that business. Ortho, is a business that is under repair for us still and we\u2019ve commented on these calls before, and I think it\u2019s still true that that\u2019s an area where competition is just really fierce meaning there\u2019s a lot of discounting, a lot of packaged deals, people trying to load up customers, etc. Probably the most competitive area of dentistry right now and the one area that I would say is under price pressure. Those circumstances continue from what we commented on over the last couple of quarters.", "", "[Unidentified Analyst] \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "How far along are you in the process of regaining some of those clients that you lost a few years back?", "James G. Mosch ", "We\u2019ve consistently worked over the last couple of quarters on regaining those customers. I think as Bret has described, it has been somewhat of a dog fight. We believe that we got the initial two-thirds back pretty quickly. Obviously, capacity has increased in the market. The price pressure is there, market indications may be that [K] starts are probably flat at best so it\u2019s a very challenging market environment. I think we are putting programs in place, we are making the investments in the field organization and we are actively working to regain those customers.", "Bret W. Wise ", "I might add that I think we commented earlier or previously that we\u2019re managing this business for customer count at this stage. So again, we\u2019re very, very focused on basically an account-by-account war or battle if you will and again, obviously competition is doing what they can to keep those accounts as well.", "[Unidentified Analyst] \u2013 William Blair & Co.", "One more if I could. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there\u2019d be some discontinued products over the next couple of quarters. Will we see an impact to the topline from those or will it be too small to notice?", "Christopher T. Clark ", "It depends on timing and in part this is subject to what we\u2019re doing to the lab business in Europe so that\u2019s subject to discussions with the Works Councils. To the extent it\u2019s significant we\u2019ll call it out for you. I don\u2019t expect it to be material to the company any way, probably some trimming around the edges but if any one period is notable then we\u2019ll comment on it for you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Erin Wilson \u2013 Bank of America.", "Erin Wilson \u2013 Bank of America", "Can you just go over kind of what are the next immediate steps to your cost savings initiatives that you\u2019ve laid out? It sounds like you\u2019re progressing according to plan but has anything surprised you there and can you quantify how much were incremental costs associated with those initiatives that may have offset some of the profit margin improvement in the quarter as well as what\u2019s embedded in the guidance for the fourth quarter?", "Bret W. Wise ", "I\u2019m going to start by talking about the initiative itself, I\u2019m going to let Chris address the impact in the second and third quarters and the impact we expect in the fourth quarter. The program is pretty broad, it\u2019s designed to take advantage of the global footprint we have, become as efficient as we can and then direct resources out to growth areas in the business model. The areas that we\u2019ve commented on thus far are procurement initiative and that\u2019s well under way. That\u2019s an area actually that we\u2019re investing in right now. ", "We\u2019ve talked about consolidation of certain business units, Jim mentioned those in his remarks. Those are important, we\u2019ve had a total of three manufacturing facilities be consolidated since we initiated the program. I don\u2019t want to get into forward-looking statements on the program at this point because in part where this program goes will be subject to things like discussions with the Works Council that we\u2019ve mentioned in Germany so far. ", "But I think from a broad perspective it\u2019s based on and we\u2019ll see savings in both the gross margin line and the SG&A line and the reinvestment will probably be more in the SG&A line. Chris, do you anything to add?", "Christopher T. Clark ", "In terms of the external costs, if you will, incremental costs associated with the program you should think of it probably in the terms of half a penny headwind to the third quarter and probably closer to a full penny in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s embedded in the $0.05 collective headwind that I mentioned earlier. ", "Erin Wilson \u2013 Bank of America", "Can you elaborate on that pull forward in the quarter that you mentioned that benefitted revenue and if that\u2019s something that carries forward into the next quarter or how we should think about that?", "Christopher T. Clark ", "This is an annual occurrence if you [inaudible] agree in the context of we go out and many of our businesses have annual prices increases October 1st. We telegraph those price increases to our distributor partners that basically allows them to make the necessary changes they need to in their systems relative to their pricing, their catalogs, etc. That also provides them an opportunity to look at the price increase and make some buying decisions on their part relative to what they want to pull in, in advance of that. ", "In a lower interest rate environment \u2013 we took \u2013 our price increase overall was pretty similar to normal years but obviously, in a lower interest rate environment some dealers may have pulled in a little more year-on-year than they did last year. Again, I don\u2019t think this is that significant but it may be 40 to 50 basis points in terms of the overall internal growth number in the quarter and obviously, that would be a temporary impact that would then come out in the fourth quarter. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Most of my questions have been answered at this point but let me circle back to one implant question if I could and then maybe just one quick modeling question. On the implant side, a number obviously above what a lot of us were expecting. I was wondering if maybe you could give us some EV details by geography? You said it was more robustly launched in September, I think that\u2019s probably a US and maybe a German comment but where else could we see that launched here in the next six, to 12, to 18 months and any comments on when you might be able to get that into Japan?", "Bret W. Wise ", "Let me let Jim deal with the timing issues on that.", "James G. Mosch ", "From a standpoint of the launch, the majority of our launch impacts have occurred really in Europe and some of the larger geographies, Germany really started up in summer and then in the United States we\u2019ve been managing capacities on this launch. Conversion process has been very strong, as a result we started some of the larger markets fats. So quite frankly, we\u2019ve seen good growth really from the European markets and then the North American markets quite frankly are just getting started. So we expect to see favorable impacts from them over time. ", "I would say the North American market is challenging. It\u2019s a large market, it\u2019s heavily referral base and as a result the conversion process can be a bit more demanding but we\u2019re seeing good uptake from that standpoint. As it relates to Japan, we\u2019re in the very \u2013 obviously, we\u2019ve gone ahead with the registration process. We don\u2019t have a good timeframe on that right now. If I had an expectation I would expect more towards the end of next year at the earliest for Japan.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "On the North American comments, I think probably even Europe to a certain extent with EV, we\u2019ve heard in some of our conversations that there might be some channel abutment issues you\u2019re still kind of going through and obviously, I think some of the Atlantis specialty abutment business maybe facing a little bit of pressure in general over the last year. But generally speaking, have you been dealing with some channel inventory issues there? Is there reason to believe that over the next quarter or two if you\u2019re already growing back in line with market that we have a chance to see kind of some above market growth out of your implant business here over the next few quarters?", "Bret W. Wise ", "I think that\u2019s a little hard to predict right at this stage. I would say on our digital business, on our Atlantis businesses, it was in my prepared comments, we still see double digit growth globally in that business and we continue to integrate some other portfolios in that business such as our Essix products line. So we\u2019re seeing some good movement in that portfolio.", "The abutment issue is probably stronger in the referral based markets because you have a situation where you have general practitioners and labs that obviously have liquidation of abutment inventories and as those recover we should see improved growth.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Then Chris just a couple of modeling questions here real quickly. We talked a little bit about that pull forward effect that\u2019ll impact fourth quarter a little bit, it doesn\u2019t sound like from Bret\u2019s comments that the product rationalization issues will create much of a headwind going forward or at least not a sizeable one. How do we think about then as that customer insourcing issue comes off, I was interested to hear your lab comments that maybe that business starting to bottom out. I think that\u2019s maybe a 50 to 100 basis points of drag here for the last couple of years so is there \u2013 as these new products launch and those issues come off, it seems like there\u2019s some tailwinds here going into \u201915, and I know you\u2019re not providing \u201915 guidance, but is it right to think of some of those things coming off as providing some incremental tailwinds into next year?", "Christopher T. Clark ", "Obviously, you [inaudible] we\u2019ll give some thoughts on \u201915 a little bit in more depth here on the next call but I think there\u2019s a number of pluses and minuses here. Jim spoke, I think, to the implant momentum and obviously any additional momentum there is certainly helpful. Relative to the non-dental product in the US that\u2019s being insourced that\u2019ll be a headwind here for a little bit yet but sequentially a little bit less for the next couple of quarters. Obviously, a big factor for us is Russia CIS in the context of basically how that looks.", "That continues to be a headwind of about 140 basis points on the European number so from that angle any improvement there is certainly going to help us. You hit it in terms of new products. I mean, innovation drives our business, Jim hit several of those and obviously, as we have stronger innovation cycles, that certainly should help us as well. So again, I think there\u2019s a number of pluses and minuses with it but I think that overall we certainly are pleased with the little bit more momentum that we had in Q3.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel", "Maybe just two or three questions, Christ the first one, the gross margins were really big and I know you called out good mix but you had that performance in light of no longer benefitting from sort of a build in inventory. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve seen gross margin expansion north of 100 bips since early 2012 so can you just maybe parse out for us in your opinion what level of the expansion is sustainable? Then when we look out at the 20% out margin goal, maybe going forward from here how do you see that mix between op ex leverage and further gross margin expansion?", "Christopher T. Clark ", "Let me answer the second part first and then we\u2019ll kind of come back to the quarter. As we look at the 20% operating margin goal, we see opportunities both on the SG&A side as well as on the gross profit side. Relative to the gross profit side specifically, capacity utilization and obviously the procurements leverage that we think we can get out by acting in a far more coordinating manner globally is certainly helpful to that gross profit line and obviously, we\u2019ve anticipated that gaining more momentum moving forward.", "On the SG&A side obviously, as look to leverage our SG&A base more effectively across our businesses I think that certainly is most helpful there. So I think I would characterize the improvement to the 20% operating margin goal as really hitting both lines pretty materially. In terms of the quarter, on the gross profit rate we were up 110 basis points. We had the two largest impacts there were price and mix in that order. ", "I think that certainly we also did have a bit of improvement in terms of underlying manufacturing costs. But again, we certainly focus on both price and mix on an ongoing basis. We\u2019re pleased with the result in the quarter and again, I don\u2019t know that I would say that I would anticipate 110 basis points every quarter in terms of gross profit rates but I also think these are strategies in place by our businesses in terms of being aggressive where they can be on price and also focusing on what they can do particularly through innovation to drive to higher margin products.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel", "Bret, for you the efficiency that\u2019s been impressive and quite honestly a little bit quicker to materialize than we thought especially in light of still modest growth in the industry and I believe you even got a little bit of an FX headwind on the op margin so you\u2019re up or tracking towards probably 70 basis points here in \u201914. I think you initially said you expected the cadence to be somewhat consistent to the 20%. Is this something where as you sit here six months post putting some of the initiatives in place you feel very confident about getting 20% in \u201917 and if market growth returns you could even see going north of that?", "Bret W. Wise ", "I think the easy answer to that question is yes, we\u2019re very confident we can get to the 20% by 2017. I mean, it\u2019s ingrained in all of our planning, we\u2019ve got a number of initiatives underway to make sure we achieve that so I think you should view the confidence as high that we\u2019ll get there. As far as the phasing or the timing of that, thus far this year it looks a little bit linear. I don\u2019t think it will be linear throughout the three year period because some of it will be event driven. So there will be some periods where we get greater margin expansion, there may be some periods where we give a little bit of that back as we make reinvestments or for whatever reason.", "We\u2019re pleased with where it has gone so far. It does look linear so far but it\u2019s unlikely to be linear going forward and I think the entire organization is fully engaged to make sure we make that 20% target in \u201917.", "Jonathan Block \u2013 Stifel", "Last one, if I can just quickly get one additional one in there. Bret, I think this one is also for you, just on the implant side more than implant mix I\u2019d go more down the road of channel mix, you had [inaudible] and sort of getting a new implant out here recently approved in the US and then yesterday\u2019s announcement between Patterson and Straumann, it seems like some of your competitors are getting a little bit more aggressive in the US specific to the GP channel and maybe you could just give us your thoughts on how you see that evolving and will you change your selling effort specific to that channel in the incoming quarters or years?", "Bret W. Wise ", "Let me comment on the model that has existed in the US for some time which is a referral model, I think Jim mentioned that. Typically, in implants because one it\u2019s difficult, two there\u2019s a fair amount of risks including legal risk, by far it\u2019s the most litigated area of dentistry that we know of, and the consequences of an implant failure are of course much greater and much more obvious than almost anything else we do. We believe the current model has developed because there\u2019s a fair amount of expertise required in placing the implant, placing the screw but not as much expertise required in restoring the implant.", "Jim mentioned, this makes product conversions a little bit harder in this market because you\u2019ve got to convert both the specialist and the general practitioner that is going to restore the implant. That model has worked pretty well. We\u2019ve seen failure rates well under control and that is a model that we continue to reinforce. You mentioned a couple of competitors, I don\u2019t want to talk specifically about what any one competitor is doing but we\u2019ve seen the models evolve over time, we\u2019ve seen different competitors try different strategies and frankly, we watch those closely to see if they\u2019re indicative of a market shift of any kind that we need to participate in or react to. ", "So this point, I would say we\u2019re watching it closely but staying with our support of the surgeon in placing the implant and the referral model for the restoration by the dentist.", "Operator", "", "It appears there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Derek Leckow ", "Thank you very much for your support and interest in DENTSPLY.

(NASDAQ:XRAY) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call February 18, 2015  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Bret Wise - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer", "Chris Clark - President, Chief Financial Officer", "Jim Mosch - Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer", "Derek Leckow - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Analysts", "Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies", "John Kreger - William Blair", "Ethan Roth - Stifel", "Steven Valiquette - UBS", "Erin Wilson - Bank of America", "Operator", "Good day, and welcome to the DENTSPLY International, Fourth Quarter Year End 2014 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. ", "At this time I will like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. ", "Derek Leckow", "Thank you, Kyle. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 results. I\u2019m joined by Bret Wise, DENTSPLY\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Mosch, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. ", "I hope you had a chance to review our press release issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release and a set of supplemental slides and information relating to non-GAAP financials are available for download in the Investor Relation\u2019s section of our website, www.DENTSPLY.com under the heading quarterly results.", "And don\u2019t forget the Safe Harbor language and U.S. GAAP reconciliation contained in today\u2019s release also pertain to this conference call. We may make forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in the release and in our SEC filings. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make today.", "The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. ", "With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bret Wise. Bret. ", "Bret Wise", "Thank you Derek and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us again on the call this morning. I have just a few opening comments on the state of the markets, our strategic priorities, and then briefly on our results, and then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim and Chris who will provide more details.", "First on the markets, generally the trends that we saw earlier in the year continued in Q4. Overall, the global markets were reasonably stable with the exception of the CIS region which continued its steep decline. U.S. markets certainly is showing signs of life, probably at about the same pace as in Q3 or may be a little bit better. ", "The European market, ex-CIS, remained flattish with some markets growing slowly and some contracting a bit, however, I will say there is a slight bias towards improvement there. The markets that we\u2019re growing, there are more of them and they are a little bit more robust and there are fewer markets that we are contracting.", "The rest of the world was of course a mixed bag. The growth markets continued to be China, select countries in Asia; India, Middle East, and Canada, while Australia was stable and Japan and Brazil declined modestly. Overall, I\u2019d say the market trends are very consistent with what we saw earlier in the year, may be with a slight bias towards getting better.", "Moving to DENTSPLY, we entered 2014 focused on new project launches and growth, but also on improving our efficiency in terms of operating margins, asset churns, and cash flow as priorities. We also established a target to achieve an adjusted operating margin of 20% by 2017, and that was off a 17.6% base in 2013. So, we are looking for approximately 240 basis points of improvement over that period of time. ", "We made some good progress on these priorities in 2014, significantly increasing our operating margins, our asset churns, and our cash flow generation. We also are now moving several elements of the efficiency program from planning to implementation and thus we expect to see more improvements, substantially more progress over the next eight quarters or so.", "It\u2019s also important to remember that this program is not only about efficiency and cost, but it\u2019s also about reducing fixed cost in favor of variable spending and investment in growth initiatives, in particular opportunities we see in research, clinical work, and customer facing areas of our global platform. Overall, there are some good signs of our progress in our reports this past year and we expect to build on those as we move through 2015 and 2016. ", "Separately, based on our cash flow in 2014, we are now in a good position to re-deploy cash to benefit shareholders. You already began to see this in our share repurchase program in 2014, which accelerated notably from prior years, and we\u2019ll give you more details on that this morning. Of course, acquisitions also remain a high priority for us to the extent we can find attractive returns through acquisition growth as we move forward. ", "Looking at the numbers, sales growth ex-PM was up 1.8% constant currency for the year, and the fourth quarter came in at a positive 2.1% constant currency with 1.9% of that being internal growth.", "Regionally, internal growth in Q4 was strongest in the rest of world at a positive 3.4%, followed by Europe which was up 2.0%, and U.S. was up 0.7% in the quarter. Although retail growth was higher than that in the U.S. and you\u2019ll hear more about that this morning from Chris and Jim. Looking at underlying demand trends, we expect to see the U.S. growth pickup as we move through 2015 at this point.", "Europe was up 2% and although this is a good number in and of itself considering the economic conditions, this was still significantly depressed by the CIS region. Internal sales growth in Europe ex-CIS was up 3.8% and that\u2019s the strongest growth we\u2019ve seen in that region since the beginning of the recession in 2008.", "This builds on a pretty strong third quarter for us as well in Europe, which is of course encouraging at this point. However, we continue to believe that our growth there is quite a bit above the market growth, and although we see market improvement in 2015 as a distinct possibility in Europe, the risk of economic stability in the region remains very, very high. Sales in the rest of world were led by strong growth in Asia, modest improvements in Latin America, Canada, and Australia, and we\u2019re down in Japan and the Middle East. ", "On a product category basis, our healthcare and dental specialty sales growth was the strongest, while chairside consumables including small equipment were low-single digits and lab was negative low-single digits. ", "On earnings, operating margins expanded by 50 basis points in the quarter and were up 80 basis points for the full year. We\u2019ve shown a pretty consistent trend of improved operating margins throughout the year here, and I think that\u2019s a good sign for the impact of the programs we have instituted. ", "Cash flow also improved significantly growing to $560 million for the year; that\u2019s up 34% compared to the prior year, and again I think both the margins and the cash flow generation reflect well in the efficiency program and our ability to turn earnings into cash flow as we work towards our long term ROIC target of 12% to 15%.", "Going forward, we are emphasizing new product innovations and launches, a strong platform that we have for clinical education and procedural selling and investment in our sales force to ensure that they are the most knowledgeable group in the field. This combined with our efficiency program and reinvestment of our cash flows set the stage for growing shareholder value over time. ", "Looking ahead to 2015, we are facing rather severe changes in currency exchange markets, which at the current rates will impact our results significantly. Derek\u2019s included a slide on currency, the change in currency exchange rates that he posted this morning on the website for you to see. We have programs in place to mute or offset some of the effects of the rate movement, however with 66% of our sales in international markets, the impact is still very substantial.", "At current rates, we estimate the currency impacts net of hedging activities is approximately a $0.14 per share drag on earnings in 2015 versus 2014, and again that\u2019s net of our hedging activities. With this in mind and considering the market conditions and what we can achieve in our efficiency program net of the investments in that program, we are establishing initial expectations for adjusted earnings per share of 250 to 260 per share. ", "So before I turn this over to Jim, overall operationally we believe the underlying performance of the company is moving along the trajectory towards the goals we\u2019ve put forth, namely operating margin expansion, improving our cash flows, and improving ROIC and we\u2019re optimistic about market growth expectations in certain key markets for 2015 to help boost results. Jim.", "Jim Mosch", "Thank you Bret. I would like to comment on operational highlights for Q4 in 2014 and provide some perspective on 2015, and I\u2019ll then turn it over to Chris. ", "2014 saw lower than expected internal growth in the first half of the year and we saw improvement in Q3 and Q4. In the U.S. we saw good retail growth of our chairside consumables in the mid-single-digit range, although wholesale growth was muted. ", "More specifically, our resources business saw continued performance from new products such as TPH Spectra, Prime&Bond Elect, and the Class II marketing campaign, all supporting excellent growth. In addition, our prevention hygiene businesses has leveraged new product launches such as NUPRO Varnish and Cavitron FITGRIP driving growth above consumables overall. This was somewhat offset by lab, which was negative driven by declines in traditional lab products.", "Outside the U.S., we saw a real acceleration in the chairside consumable categories. In Q4, Western Europe internal growth was up mid-single digits and Asia was up double digits, which helped to counter very slow growth in Latin America and contraction in CIS. ", "Looking to our healthcare business, we continue to leverage previous launches of the Origo male catheter and Sense [ph] female catheter and healthcare grew nicely in the quarter in both Europe and the U.S.", "Of the products launch in Q4 we have been very pleased with the success of both the Midwest E Electric handpiece and the TRUSHAPE dental retention endodontic system. The Midwest E has provided an entrance into the growing electric handpiece segment. Response has been excellent and sales were XXX expectations in Q4. In addition, TRUSHAPE has been well received by the endodontic community and the minimally invasive and dental retention attributes has resonated with clinicians.", "Turning to our implant business we\u2019ve had excellent acceptance of the new Astra Tech EV implant system, which now represents greater than 50% of our Astra Tech implant system, all which was occurred in the first year of launch. As indicated, we had a delayed start in the U.S. and Germany as the conversion rate exceeded demand, leading to inventory liquidation as clinicians transitioned to the new system.", "We forecasted recovery in the back half, which we saw in Q3. In Q4 total implant performance improves sequentially to mid single digits constant currency growth. Our implant performance was driven by growth in the U.S. and the rest of the world and Europe was positive despite the 200 basis point headwind from Russia CIS.", "In 2014 we completed the integration of our digital businesses, which is Atlantis Abutments, Isus bars and bridges and materialized surgical guides. These products are now being sold by the DENTSPLY implant sales organization. Through this effort we have seen high single digit growth of our digital portfolio and solid growth in each product group.", "As we discussed throughout the year, operational effectiveness was a key focus area. This came in a form of several facility consolidations in U.S. and Europe, cost reduction initiatives and networking capital improvement. These efforts delivered cost savings, gross margin improvement, operating margin expansion throughout 2014.", "In Q4 we had solid networking capital improvement with the six-day inventory reduction and operating margin improved 50 basis points and we also had record cash flow. These results added to a good performance throughout the year. Chris will discuss these in more detail. ", "As we enter 2015 we will continue our operational initiatives and we will work to deliver operating margin expansion and networking capital improvement. Commercially we look forward to the IDS in Cologne, German in March as in the past we will have the DENTSPLY village with all dental divisions represented, new products will be the theme and we expect to launch 12 new products at the show with some strictly important launches in our lab and endodontic businesses.", "In addition to innovation, we will focus heavily on expanding and developing our sales organization and increasing our clinical education initiatives, which we believe are all directly alighted with our success in the market. ", "I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Chris Clark to review the financial results.", "Chris Clark", "Thank you Jim. Good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to provide some detail on both our fourth quarter and our full year results by reviewing key elements of our income statement and also providing some additional color on our balance sheet and cash flow. ", "The fourth quarter sales excluding precious metals decline 3.2% compared to the prior year, as internal growth of 190 basis points and net impact from acquisitions of 20 basis points were more than fully offset by unfavorable currency translation of 530 basis points.", "Internal growth was 0.7% in the U.S. and was negatively impacted by the headwind from channel inventory contractions associated with purchasing ahead of our October price increase that we mentioned on our third quarter call, as well as the 180 basis point headwind from lower small equipment sales compared to a very strong prior year base that included a major new product launch. ", "From a retail standpoint our growth in the U.S. was much better than this and we expect this to continue as we move into 2015. European internal growth was 2.0% in the quarter including 3.8% excluding Russia CIS, which continues to contract well into double digits as a result of the economic and political situation there. ", "For the quarter Russia CIS was a headwind to our global internal growth figure by approximately 80 basis points. Our rest of the world internal growth of 3.4% in the quarter was led by particularly strong performances in the Pacific Rim as Bret mentioned. ", "Gross profit on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 57.4% of sales excluding precious metals, which was an improvement of 90 basis points over prior year and reflects the favorable impact of price, mix, FX and some of our recent operational improvement efforts, partially offset by lower absorption as we took out inventory in the period. ", "SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 39.6% of sales excluding precious metals. That\u2019s up 30 basis points compared to our rate in the fourth quarter 2013 and includes some heavier spending associated with our operational improvement initiatives, consistent with our comments on the third quarter call.", "Operating margin for the quarter improved by 50 basis points to 17.7% of sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis, and that compares to 17.2% in the fourth quarter last year and reflects the gross margin SG&A impact that I just described. ", "Currency represented a headwind of earnings in the quarter of between $0.02 and $0.03 per share and that was approximately three quarters of $0.001 worse than what we anticipated on the third quarter earnings call, and the U.S. dollar strengthens subsequent to that call and drove an incremental unfavorable translation headwind. ", "Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 11.9%, while our operating tax rate was 22.1%, which was 130 basis points above our fourth quarter rate last year. You will recall that we mentioned on our third quarter call that we anticipated an unfavorable comparison to prior year quarter in the tax line, primarily as a result of unfavorable geographic mix.", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as reported basis in the fourth quarter was $84.7 million or $0.59 per diluted share and that compares to $74.4 million or $0.51 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2013. These results include a number of items which we\u2019ve listed in the schedules in the release. ", "On an adjusted basis net earnings were $86.6 million in the quarter, down slightly from $87.9 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.50 per share, down from $0.61 for last year.", "Our results include the headwinds that we anticipated on our third quarter call including currency, tax, incremental investments to support our operating and margin improvements and our modest contraction of channel inventories as a result of purchases ahead of the October price increase. Although the net impact of these items was probably a bit worse than what we anticipated. ", "Transitioning now to the full year results for 2014. Sales excluding precious metals were 0.8% compared to the prior year, including 120 basis points of internal growth, 60 basis points from net acquisitions and negative currency translation impact of 100 basis points. The headwinds in CIS had a negative impact on the internal growth of 70 basis points on our global number for the year and after providing a pretty nice benefit to the internal growth in 2013. For the year the U.S. comprised 34% of our global sales, while Europe represented 45% and the rest of the world region represented 21%. ", "Operating margin for the year improved 80 basis points to 18.4% of sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis. That compares to 17.6% last year. We are pleased with this improvement in operating leverage, particularly given the slower than ideal market conditions we face during much of the year particularly in Europe.", "On an adjusted basis net earnings for the year increased to $361 million from $341.2 million in 2013 and adjusted earnings per share grew 6% to $2.50 per diluted share from $2.35 per diluted share in 2013. ", "Our results for the year include a negative impact from currency of approximately $0.04 per share, which is generally in line with what we anticipated in our initial guidance for the year. Based on current rates, currency is a much larger headwinds for us in 2015 and I\u2019ll describe that in more detail in a moment. ", "Moving on to cash flow, our operating cash flow for the year was a record $560.4 million. That\u2019s up 34% from $417.8 million last year. While free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less capital expenditures grew 45% to $461 million from $318 million a year ago. This improvement reflects earnings growth and the improved working capital performance and also continued tax benefits associated with recent acquisitions. As a result, our free cash flow conversion was strong at 143% of reported net income for the year, while our trailing 12-month free cash flow yield now stands north of 6%. ", "Our cash flow performance allowed us to continue to take a more balanced approach to capital deployment as we move through the year, including acquisitions and share buy backs. In the fourth quarter we completed one acquisition in Europe, as well as two small divestitures, one in the U.S. and one in Europe, none of these were material to our financial results.", "In the fourth quarter we also accelerate our share repurchases by buying back over 1.7 million shares in the quarter at an average cost of $52.88 per share. For the full year the company repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares. We ended 2014 with a net debt to capitalization ratio of 32.4% compared to 35.2% at the end of 2013 and 48.2% right after the Astra Tech acquisition. ", "Looking forward, our balance sheet provides us considerable flexibility to deploy capital through acquisitions and share buybacks. ", "Inventories now standard at 113 days, which is down six days compared to September, down 10 days from June and down one day compared to December 2013. For the year our inventory pattern was pretty consistent with what we anticipated as we had indicated that inventories would drop in the second half of 2014, after increasing previously as a resulted transition plants associated with anticipated operational changes.", "Looking ahead, we anticipate continued progress in this area recognizing that there is some seasonality to our inventory patterns, as inventories will tend to increase a bit in the first half of the year. ", "Accounts receivable days were 55 days the ended December, just down seven days from the prior quarter to down one day compared to December 2013. Capital expenditures for the year totaled $100 million, while depreciation was $81 million and amortization was $48 million. ", "As we move into 2015, we are pleased with the operating performance of the business, particularly the improvements driving our operating margin rate and cash flow performance. Well our assumptions for 2015 include continued improvements in both these areas, we are also reflecting a series of unprecedented moves in foreign currency rates over the last 60 days, including significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major foreign currencies, as well as the significant weakening of the Euro relative to the Swiss Frank. ", "The U.S. Dollar is now 14% stronger relative to the Euro than it was on average in 2014, with similar strengthening across other key currencies, including the Swedish Krona, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and British Pound. At current rates these movements would create an unfavorable impact to our sales results for 2015 of about 800 basis points. ", "With respect to earnings, at current rates the impact to adjusted EPS for 2015 would be approximately $0.14 per share, reflecting a substantial benefit from our cash flow heading program. Absent the impact from the hedges, the earnings headwind from FX would be about double the $0.14 that we are currently facing. These hedges helped to partially blend our FX impact over a rolling 18-month period. While they do not eliminate or reduce the long-term impact of currency changes they do reduce the volatility by essentially gradualizing rate changes. ", "Longer-term, one target benefit of our operating margin improvement initiatives is a standardized production processes across similar facilities, allowing us to flex a portion of our production between plants and geographies based on the number of factors, including currency movements. In the near term we are accelerating targeted actions to address specific costs and pricing opportunities as a result of the currency challenge. ", "As we provided our 2015 earnings guidance I want to point out that this is on a non-GAAP basis, and excludes the impact of amortization, restructuring related activities and fair market value adjustments on derivatives, financial instruments and pensions. ", "As Bret stated, we are establishing our 2015 earnings per share guidance as $2.50 to $2.60 on an adjusted basis. Our guidance reflects the impact of the incremental current headwind of approximately $0.14 per share and the non-GAAP adjustments that I mentioned earlier. ", "In addition, our guidance reflects an anticipated 50 basis points headwind in our 2015 tax rate compared to 2014\u2019s rate and that\u2019s a result of projected unfavorable geographic earnings mix. There may be some opportunity to prove on the tax rate as we move through the year; we\u2019ll just have to see. ", "That completes our prepared remarks. We certainly appreciate your support and we\u2019ll now be glad to take any questions that you might have. ", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.", "Nathan Rich", "Hi, this is Nathan Rich on for Bob today. Chris, first question for you. You just mentioned the ability to maybe shift manufacturing and costs across geographies to offset some of the FX impact. I was just wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail on how big of an opportunity is this, and is there an benefit from doing this assumed in your guidance. ", "Chris Clark", "Yes, Nathan. As we look at that, that\u2019s certainly one of the longer-term objectives associated with the operating margin improvement initiatives. As we look at it, we have plants that make similar products, not always necessarily the exact same product or using the exact same process in terms of manufacturing process. ", "So one of our objectives of the initiative is frankly to standardize that on a much more common basis allowing some plants that are producing similar products to actually produce the same products in the same manner, and that would allow us over time to flex production back and forth based on a number of different factors, including FX. ", "I would say that we have some limited capability to-date to do that. I would say that that is a longer term objective, and while there may be a little bit of help in that in 2015, I would say that\u2019s really more of a longer term benefit that we see from the program. ", "Nathan Rich", "Great. Thanks and then Bret you talked about U.S. growth being a little bit soft, and I understand I guess there was some pull forward ahead of the price increase in October. Could you just maybe talk about your expectations for 2015 in the U.S. Do you see that internal growth rate kind of improving throughout the year and then also internationally just kind of any impact on kind of the sales and earnings cadence around the IDS Show?", "Bret Wise", "Okay Nathan, quickly our U.S. growth was muted for the reasons that both Jim and Chris covered. I do think that the U.S. market has accelerated somewhat as we move through the year, and there is no reason not to expect it won\u2019t accelerate going forward, and that\u2019s why in our comments we said we expect our own internal growth in the U.S. to accelerate as we move through 2015, so we are reasonably comfortable with that. ", "On international and the effects of the IDS, the IDS is not a big selling show for consumables. Meaning, we go to the show, we demonstrate our new products, and then over a subsequent month or subsequent quarters we try to get back to those dentists or those customers and re-engage on the new technology. So, we don\u2019t usually see a big boost in short-term growth from the IDS, in fact what we see is a big boost in spending for the IDS. It is quite an expensive show. ", "So if we look at first quarter, our first quarter, it\u2019s probably going to be the most challenging quarter we have for the reasons stated there, that we are likely \u2013 I think that U.S. growth will accelerate its growth through the year that will help us. It\u2019s probably more back-end loaded than front-end loaded, and spending will probably be front end loaded, both on the efficiency programs and on trade shows, the IDS being the largest. ", "But it usually doesn\u2019t resolve in a quick ramp-up in sales, it\u2019s more a precursor to sales later in the year. ", "Nathan Rich", "Great, thanks for the color. ", "Bret Wise", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. ", "Jeff Johnson ", "Thank you. Good morning guys, how are you?", "Bret Wise", "Good morning Jeff. ", "Chris Clark", "Good morning Jeff. ", "Jeff Johnson ", "Good. Just wondering Chris maybe we could just start on the Russia CIS. You\u2019ve been helpful the last few quarters providing the breakout there, but we are starting to bump-up against the much easier comps there. Should we still expect down -- on top of down comps over the next few quarters or just what\u2019s going on in that business. Obviously the geo-political stuff is still an issue there. ", "Chris Clark", "Yes I think you have a couple of factors going on. Obviously, it is very unstable from an economic situation. We think that the demand levels are continuing to drop. Certainly, we are not seeing any sequentially improvements if they are continuing to decline in double digits, and so from that angle, I think that\u2019s an indication that it really has not stabilized. ", "First quarter, we began to run-up against the base. So, from that angle, we are running against a base that declined as opposed to a base that improved, but I guess I would say that, that base has continued to decline the subsequent three quarters. ", "So again, I guess all I can say at this stage is it\u2019s highly uncertain and certainly we would hope that it stabilizes, and that\u2019s historically been a nice growth market for us, but it\u2019s been a pretty significant headwind, and I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s going to flip around anytime soon. ", "Jeff Johnson ", "All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then Bret going back to some of your comments on the first question there around margins, you know margins continue to impress this quarter. I think it\u2019s seven straight quarters here that you guys have put up some very solid margin improvement. Is it fair to think though, we have to think of those margins kind of flattening out. I\u2019m just trying to read your comments on the IDS spending and the kind of improvement on the U.S. organic throughout the year. Would it be kind of flat to start the year and then some nice expansion as we exit the year or how to think about that margin gating?", "Chris Clark", "Yes, thanks Jeff. You know, I think for the full year, we are comfortable in saying we are going to see continued margin improvement in 2015. Part of that\u2019s our self-help program and part of that\u2019s I think the opportunity for faster growth in the U.S. in particular. I do think quarter is always hard to predict. First quarter, I think is going to be the most challenging for the spending that you commented on. So I don\u2019t really have high expectations for the first quarter for margin improvement. I think it will be more backend loaded in the year this year.", "Jeff Johnson ", "All right, that\u2019s helpful. And then just Chris back on the FX, issues for the year. It sounds like you are saying that about 50% of the impact flows through this year and obviously currency is going to be volatile over coming months and quarters in that, I\u2019m sure. So is that kind of a flow though rate we should be thinking of. I know its varied anywhere from 50% flow-through to a 100% flow through over the last few years. But is that \u2013 with the hedging in place kind of 50% the right number at this point. ", "Chris Clark", "Yes, at this point in time Jeff, that\u2019s correct. I mean recognize that the caveat for this is highly volatile, right. I mean these rates are flipping around significantly, constantly almost hour by hour. ", "So yes, as we sit here today, we think the headwind in approximately $0.14 in terms of earnings at current rates for the impact on 2015. But that includes about that size of benefit in that net number from the cash flow hedges. ", "Those cash flow hedges again, I guess they anniversary themselves, they go away. So again, the gross impact is basically close to double that $0.14. ", "Jeff Johnson ", "Yes, okay. Thanks guys. Yes got it thanks. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Hi guys, thanks for taking the questions. I have one longer-term cash flow question; I guess that would be for Chris. You guys have given us a pretty helpful roadmap for how you think about margins improving over time. The cash flow improvement in 2014 was obviously very strong. Would you be willing to speak to a longer-term view, maybe through 2017, just to be consistent with the commentary on the margin improvement? ", "You know thinking about how you can grow, either operating a fee cash flow over that period of time. We know margins keep improving, but obviously you\u2019ve had some improvements on the balance sheet as well. Can you give us a sense for how that flows from here? Thanks.", "Bret Wise", "Yes, I guess I would say Steve that as we think about the objectives of our self health program as Bret describes it, obviously margins are certainly one of that and the other piece frankly is to continue to improve our ROIC and by basically addressing the asset base, including working capital. ", "We think we have opportunities over time to continue to improve in the working capital side. Again, that\u2019s going to be a gradual improvement, but we think that we showed some improvement, solid improvement in 2014. We\u2019re hoping to continue to, we expect to continue to drive that in \u201915 and beyond. ", "So I think that as we think about the cash flow opportunities, I think the cash flow opportunity is really too full. No one, it improved earnings as a result of the operating margin improvement and then secondly the improvements in networking capital over time. So I mean again, I think that growth certainly drives it as well I guess would be the third factor in the context of as today\u2019s markets improves and internal growth improves and then that\u2019s obviously a factor as well. So those three things would cause me to say over time we would expect that to continue to improve.", "Steve Beuchaw", "And then I want to follow up on implants. I wonder if you\u2019d be willing to give us any geographic and deconstruction of how the growth was looking in your implant business towards the end of the year. How do you see it into next year? ", "And then while we are on the topic of implants, given the amount of strategic activity going on in the implant market, are you seeing any opportunities for commercial traction, incremental share gains or maybe a bit of opportunity to capitalize on attrition given the amount of activity out there? Thanks.", "Jim Mosch", "Yes Steve, this is Jim Mosch. As I mentioned in my comments, I think one of the things that we relied on significantly in 2014 was the EV launch. As I mentioned, we\u2019re probably ahead about 50%, a little more than a 50% conversion level of that system and I will also say that that\u2019s been pretty evenly distributed. We saw continued sequential growth in the U.S., so we\u2019re kind of pleased with that position. I think we recognize that we needed improvement in that area from early in the year. We saw that in Q3 and Q4 and we expect that to continue into 2015.", "Likewise Europe was strong ex-CIS. CIS has been a challenge. That\u2019s a pretty sizable market for us and we don\u2019t expect to see a lot of improvement in that situation in 2015. As Chris mentioned, it\u2019s very, very volatile. From the rest of the world situation we\u2019ve seen improvement in the Pacific Rim through 2014. ", "So as I look at it I believe that we\u2019re well positioned. We\u2019re seeing nice growth in our digital portfolio. We have continued traction in the EV system and we would expect to continue to improve in the overall implant business.", "On the commercial side, I think we\u2019re going to be absorbing EV really throughout 2015. We do have some new opportunities. We will have some product additions that we\u2019ll show at the IDS as it relates to Atlantis and our digital portfolio and we expect to kind of get some continued growth from that segment, but as far as a major commercial shift, I don\u2019t see anything on the horizon.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Very helpful. Thanks Jim.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. ", "Brandon Couillard", "Thanks, good morning. Bret, back on the U.S. business, just to make sure I heard this right, did you say that the hand piece comp was a 80 basis point headwind in the fourth quarter and then could you parse out just the tier side consumables trend and how that shaped up in the fourth quarter relative to sort of the runway we see in the last three periods.", "Chris Clark", "Sure Bran, I\u2019ll take a shot at that and Chris may need to interject here as well. On the small equipment decline year-over-year there\u2019s a couple of factors there. One is that we had a large launch last year. It was Aquasil Cordless was the launch and so that\u2019s a piece of equipment that goes along with an impression material, suite of products that\u2019s called \u2013 that was very successful last year and it created a big baseline for us to get over this year.", "But secondly we saw small equipment generally slow down in the fourth quarter and diverge from the growth rates of consumables. That happens from time to time, but not that often and when it does diverge significantly we call it out. I would assume that that\u2019s temporary and its probably going to play itself out here over the next few quarters as those two growth rates, consumables and small equipment kind of return to a common norm. ", "As far as consumables themselves, the chairside consumable component of our business grew retail quite nicely in the fourth quarter. I would say at a kind of an accelerating pace. Now it was [indiscernible] hidden by the small equipment impact and also the slight destocking coming out of the third quarter price increases. ", "But I think Jim commented that we\u2019re in mid single digits in those products. We had some encouraging reports on that market from one large distributor earlier in the month and like we mentioned, we think that that consumable segment is going to continue to accelerate going into \u201915 in the U.S. So we\u2019re reasonably optimistic about that market.", "Brandon Couillard", "Thanks and then Chris, in terms of the outlook for next year, can you give us some parameters around operating cash flow in CapEx and then just to clarify, does the guidance contemplate any contribution from incremental share repurchases?", "Bret Wise", "The guidance at this point basically includes the share repurchase that had been done as well as offset of future equity dilution. So from that angle that\u2019s pretty consistent with the way we typically provide guidance at the beginning of the year. ", "CapEx, at this point I would estimate that we\u2019re forecasting in the $110 million range for the year and relative to cash flow I would expect I mean obviously we\u2019re coming off an enormous base. I would expect a modest improvement, slight improvement for the year as we continue to make improvement in terms of working capital. But again, it actually would probably not be the same level of improvement that we saw in terms of 2014 over 2013.", "Brandon Couillard", "Super. Thank you.", "Bret Wise", "You bet.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair.", "John Kreger", "Hi, thanks very much. The 1.9% organic constant dollar growth that I think you had in the fourth quarter, can you give us a sense about what the price component of that was?", "Bret Wise", "Yes, as we look at it, let me ask the question John via the margin line, which did improve obviously about 90 basis points in the quarter. Price was a component of that. We did typically take our price increases on many of our businesses October 1. Our price increase overall was in the 1.5% range and we think that most of that appears to have stuck at lease in the quarter. So again, that\u2019s not on all of our businesses globally, but that\u2019s on again I guess our U.S. consumables business and several of our international business. So again, there is no doubt that price is a component of the 1.9% growth, but I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s every bit of it.", "John Kreger", "Great, thanks. So Chris given that, can you just talk a little bit more about this destocking effect that you saw in the U.S. I assume that\u2019s behind you. Do you feel like inventory levels out in the channel are pretty reasonable and stable or might we see any more of that as we move through early \u201915?", "Bret Wise", "Yes, I know. We think at this point John we\u2019re kind of entering the year at a pretty normal basis. We called out on the third quarter call that we thought that again, a few of the distributors might have gone in a little bit deeper if you will in terms of price increased pre buy activity in the quarter. Interest rates were low and that gives us obviously as we take price increases, that\u2019s how they put it through their models and make a determination in terms of what the return in terms of going deeper on key products might be and we call that out in terms of it being a potential impact. ", "Obviously it\u2019s always a little bit hard to tell in the exact amount of that, but again that was pretty much in line I would say in the fourth quarter with what we anticipated on the third quarter call. And again, we think we\u2019re entering unbalanced, entering the year again in a pretty stable position. Again, there\u2019s going to be individual businesses, plus and minus and individual geographies plus and minus, but I think overall pretty balanced.", "John Kreger", "That\u2019s all for it, thanks. Maybe one last one; particularly in the U.S. and Europe, do you have any visibility to the underlying customer type and what sort of growth your seeing into lets say the kind of smaller practice versus larger or/and corporate accounts. Are you seeing any differential in growth rates into those two classes.", "Bret Wise", "Yes, as it relates to that, I mean we certainly recognize that in certain geographies, we see it in the U.S., we see a little bit in the UK. We\u2019ve seen a little bit of activity in Canada, this kind of this rise of Corporate Dentistry. I would say that we\u2019ve had very favorable impact in those type of customers, because we have such a broad portfolio and we are able to leverage that portfolio and our clinical education programs to be able to address the needs of those types of practices. ", "I wouldn\u2019t say at this point in time we\u2019ve seen such a shift and it\u2019s a major, major change where we see a major shift between group or corporate customers versus individual practices. We haven\u2019t seen that phenomena as of yet.", "John Kreger", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Block with Stifel. ", "Ethan Roth", "Hi, thanks. This is Ethan Roth on for John. The implant business was up mid-single digits over the second consequently quarter. Last quarter you provided some commentary on the Astra Tech EV system. You mentioned that one third of conversions were coming from new customers. Are you still tracking towards similar levels of competitive conversions?", "Bret Wise", "Yes Ethan, I would say that that\u2019s probably fallen off a little bit and that\u2019s primary as we\u2019ve gotten into the larger markets of the U.S. and Germany where we obviously have much larger businesses, much larger number of customers, so there is really a capacity issues of our ability to address the needs of those customers. However, we are still seeing a good number of conversions of new customs with our EV system. But I would not say it\u2019s at that one-third level. ", "Ethan Roth", "Okay, great. And then just on the 2017 operating margin goal of 20%, what impact if any has the current changes in the FX had on that and since you are still maintaining that target, does that imply modest improvement you are thinking, just on the core margin expansion. Thanks. ", "Bret Wise", "Yes, as we look at 2014 FX was actually a little bit of headwinds, by headwind overall for the year in terms of operating margin rate. As we looked at 2015 at current rates its actually going to flip around and be a bit of a help as the drag on the top line is going to be a little bit more than the drag on the bottom line. ", "As we think about the 20%, our objective is 20% in 2017, regardless of the FX situation and so you know again, I do think there maybe a little bit of noise give or take here as we have individual periods with FX changes. But again, I think the key core for us is to keep on focusing on the underlying improvement of business and obviously we are pleased with the progress in 2014. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Steven Valiquette with UBS. ", "Steven Valiquette", "Yes thanks, I literally had the exact same question that was just asked. So I\u2019m all set now thanks?", "Bret Wise", "Okay, thanks Steve. ", "Chris Clark", "Thanks Steve. ", "Operator", "And we will take our final question from Erin Wilson with Bank of America.", "Erin Wilson ", "Great, thanks for taking my questions. In implants have you seen any sort of meaningful changes in pricing or the competitive dynamics across the implant business in light of industry consolidation and how do you envision that market evolving over the next year, but also longer term and you can speak to high end versus value as well?", "Bret Wise", "Certainly. From a standpoint of meaningful change pricing wise, we\u2019ve not seen that to-date. In fact as we look at the premium implant segment, one phenomena we have seen is that implant unit growth has increased and certainly it\u2019s taken a couple of years for that to happen. The other thing we see is that average sell prices are fairly stable and in some cases we are seeing increases. So from the standpoint of the premium implant segment it is defiantly improving and I think you see that in the performance of certainly asking some of our competitors. The industry consolidation you speak of, obviously that is actually happening as we speak. So I don\u2019t think \u2013 we\u2019ve yet to see the full impacts of what will happen with Nobel and Zimmer 3i. I think that will come down the road. ", "As far as the longer period of time, I think that\u2019s a little bit difficult to predict. Certainly we recognize that in certain geographic segments value is very important, value implants are very important and you need those systems to have access to broader market. And certainly we will look at those opportunities. ", "Erin Wilson ", "Okay, great and on capital deployment what you are looking at from an acquisition standing? Do you anticipate greater opportunities in 2015 relative to 2014? What types of acquisitions would you be potentially targeting here and on the flip side of that should we anticipate any further divestitures or the emphasis of certain product lines as part of your operational initiatives and would that be incorporated into your guidance. Thanks. ", "A - Bret Wise ", "Okay Erin, on acquisitions, both acquisitions and divestitures we haven\u2019t done yet, are not incorporated into our guidance at all. I would say that we are a little bit more optimistic about acquisitions. The ability to execute acquisitions in \u201915 than we were in \u201914, so we are activity involved in that. I think predicting how much and when is the dangerous game because there is huge timing risk and execution risk on acquisitions. ", "But I think its fair to say that we are interested in growing by acquisition, our balance sheet is in pretty good shape right now. We said in \u201914, we are repeating in \u201915 to the extent that aren\u2019t acquisitions, we\u2019ll likely be more active in share buybacks. You say us pick up the phase in share buybacks in 2014 as well. ", "So to us its kind of an either or type equation right now, to the extent there is transactions available, we\u2019ll probably transact them. Its important that they fit into the our timing for the efficiency program as well, meaning they are stable enough that we could leave them outside the efficiency program for a while or they could easily be integrated while we are doing the efficiency program as well. So we take that into account as another factor. But I think we are more optimist about the ability to pull cash, to create shareholder value that we have been for some time in the business. ", "Erin Wilson ", "Okay great, thanks so much. ", "Bret Wise", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. ", "A - Bret Wise", "Okay, thank you all for your interest in DENTSPLY. That concludes our conference call. If you other questions I\u2019m available today for follow-up, and I look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming dental shows in Chicago and at the IDS . ", "Thanks a lot. Bye.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Derek Leckow", "Thank you, Erin. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International\u2019s second quarter 2015 results. I\u2019m joined by Bret Wise, DENTSPLY\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Mosch, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. I hope you had a chance to review our press release issued earlier this morning.

Bret?", "Bret Wise", "Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone. Thank you again for joining us here on our second quarter call. Overall we were very pleased with how things developed in the second quarter. Certainly we believe the markets are showing some signs of improvement, while our own results accelerated nicely both on the topline and on the bottom-line. Before we get into specifics about our performance, I\u2019d like to provide some brief comments about the regional markets. From our perspective, the US remains quite healthy, stable and growing and given the job growth numbers, we expect that to continue. In Europe, we also saw a notable improvement in demand sequentially. This was most notable in the southern countries, but also in the UK and the Nordics. Russia on the other hand continues to be a difficult market. In the rest of world, I\u2019d say there was more good news than bad. We saw the markets demonstrating good stable growth in the Pacific Rim, the Middle East, as well as in Japan and Australia. ", "At DENTSPLY, as you know, we\u2019ve been focused on how to become more efficient internally, while channeling funds back into initiatives that can drive sustainable growth above the market irrespective of the market conditions. And in that regard we made some important strategic and operational changes that Jim will update you on in his remarks. Thus far, the program is going very well, but our reinvestments have been limited and part to the extent we\u2019ve had reinvestments, those have been focused on actually funding the efficiency initiatives. But in certain cases where we\u2019ve channeled some seed money for growth back into the business, we\u2019re getting good results, nice results and we are now entering a period where we expect to be able to generate additional savings that will allow us to begin to accelerate these investments and growth on a go- forward basis. ", "Moving to our specific results for the quarter, overall internal growth came in at a positive 3.6%. That was led by the rest of world, which was up 7.9%, followed by the US, which was up 3.3% and Europe was a positive 1.9%. The rest of world numbers are quite good and reflect solid internal growth across most of the regions that are included in this total for us. Japan recovered nicely in this quarter as expected given the low base from last year\u2019s Q2 and as you recall, that followed a VAT tax increase April 1, 2014. So there was a movement in 2014 of sales into the first quarter and now the second quarter. So the baseline for this year was rather low. However, even though Japan was strong by comparison, it was up mid-single digits, it was still slightly dilutive to the rest of world number we have here. So the 7.9% number we have for the rest of world is not really bolstered by the Japan number. ", "In US, we saw a solid demand across most of our businesses, which with the exception of lab that was down slightly. Recall that we are discontinuing some products in the lab business, which is muting the reported growth for now. In Europe, we were up 1.9% and that\u2019s despite a continued drag from the CIS region. Ex-CIS we were up 3.1%. This reflects really nice growth in consumables and the specialty categories, while lab again was negative for the same reason it was in the US. It\u2019s reflecting those discontinued products. From an execution perspective, we are pleased with the organic growth in the topline as noted and despite the significant drag from currency; we\u2019ve done pretty well bringing the earnings through the income statement. ", "On an adjusted basis, we delivered 180 basis points of operating margins expansion to get to 21.1% for the quarter. That\u2019s our best performance in five plus years. EPS was up, our adjusted EPS was up 6% in the quarter and that\u2019s despite a significant drag from currency. So overall we feel good about the results and also good about the outlook. One other thing I want to comment on was the restructuring charge we took this quarter. As you know we announced this was coming back in May when we resolved the negotiations with the Works Council in Germany and we\u2019ll now begin to implement this program in the third quarter. To date, there has been a drag on our performance from this program due to the discontinued products, which I\u2019ve mentioned here, but also because of the uncertainty of what the outcome would look like. ", "Moving into the back half of the year, we should begin to see the benefits, including more efficiency, but also more focus, more clarity on which products are important to the future of this business. Also, given our performance to date and the benefits we now see in the back half, we are in good position to begin to accelerate our growth investments while also reaching our margin and earnings goals. We are keeping a close eye on risk from this program of course, because there is the potential for disruption, but we are pleased to date that that disruption has been minimal and we\u2019ve been able to manage through it. We expect to see more benefits from putting our shoulder more firmly behind the growth projects in the program and we believe that can begin to be impactful as we move into next year. ", "So based on our earnings to date, the markets developments as we see them and the outlook for the net benefits coming from the efficiency program, we\u2019re adjusting our guidance range from the 250 to 260 that we established at the beginning of the year to a new range of adjusted earnings per share for the year of 254 to 262. This reflects our confidence in our performance so far in the initiatives we have under way and also the currency drag that we expect based on the rates today and of course also the other points I\u2019ve noted this morning. ", "I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Jim Mosch. Jim?", "Jim Mosch", "Thank you, Bret. I\u2019d like to provide an operational update for Q2 and also provide some further perspective on 2015 initiatives. I\u2019ll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review. As Bret noted, we saw good performance across all regions in Q2. Providing some perspective to this, our global consumables business delivered solid mid-single digit internal growth in the quarter. New products launched in the latter part of 2014 and Q1 of 2015 in both the restorative and preventive areas are driving growth, coupled with procedural selling efforts in the areas of class two and post endodontic restorations. In addition, US retail growth appears to be stable and growing well versus prior year. ", "Our dental specialties business also performed well with mid-single digit internal growth, led by our endodontic and implant businesses. Endodontic businesses have benefited from recently launched products such as WaveOne GOLD, ProTaper Next NiTi Files and new irrigation and root canal filling products. The implant business continues to get strong traction from our new implant system ASTRA TECH EV, SYMBIOS Biphasic Bone Graft Material and additional implant platforms in our ATLANTIS customized abutment business. The prosthetics business was down mid-single digits on a global basis. This was driven by challenging market conditions in traditional lab products and discontinued products as a result of the restructuring of our European lab business. ", "From a geographic perspective, we saw upper mid-single digit growth in rest of world, driven by Asia and Latin America. These regions certainly benefit from new products across all businesses, but in addition we have worked to stabilize these businesses, ensure dealer compliance and invested to strengthen the management teams, as well as expand the selling organizations. From a new product perspective, we highlighted the products we launched at IDS, WaveOne GOLD, endodontic files, the VDW Connect and X-Smart iQ, which is an iPad based endomotor and the Cercon ht Shaded Zirconia milling disk. We saw impact from these products in Q2. However, some of these products such as the new endomotors will begin the formal launch and shipments in Q3 and we expect improved momentum throughout the year. In addition we have a strong new product pipeline and we\u2019ll have new product launches across most of our businesses in the latter part of Q3 and Q4. ", "In the Q1 analyst call, we introduced the formation of three segments. The formation of these segments and more specifically the creation of global businesses, global product platforms and single country operating units, are part of our global efficiency and investment initiative. Our stated objective is to achieve a 20% adjusted operating margin for the full year of 2017 while providing estimates to support the growth of the business for the long term. In Q2, we crossed the 20% threshold at 21.1%. Please note that Q2 tends to be our seasonally largest and most profitable quarter. However, we are beginning to see the results from elements of our global efficiency initiative, including the procurement program which Chris will address. In addition we are proceeding with restructurings of our European lab business as well as other restructurings related to country and global business formation process. This process will accelerate as we close 2015 and throughout 2016. ", "We are confident that these are realizable expense improvements and as we effectively align the businesses and create operational efficiency. As indicated, an important element of this initiative is investment. To date, most of our spending has been utilized to create efficiencies. We now shift our focus to investments for long-term growth. We are planning increasing levels in investment over the coming quarters in areas of in-field marketing resources, salesforce expansion and expansion of clinical education through further investments in field based programs. This investment will support two or three growth drivers, sales excellence and clinical education. The third area, innovation, will see further investment in the future as the global businesses complete formation and alignment. Our objective will be to invest in larger R&D projects and platform technologies which have greater risk, but also significant value. ", "I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Chris for the financial results. ", "Chris Clark ", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to provide some detail on our second quarter results by reviewing key elements of our income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement and also by providing some additional color on capital deployment and highlight a few key related initiatives. ", "For the second quarter, sales excluding precious metals, declined 7.7% compared to prior year as internal growth of 3.6% was more than fully offset by negative currency translation of 10.9%.", "Net acquisition growth was negative 0.4% in the quarter, as the impact of several small divestitures of non-core product lines offset modest acquisition growth. ", "We had strong operating margin performance in the quarter as our second quarter operating margin rate of 21.1% of sales, excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis, improved by 180 basis points over 19.3% in the prior year quarter. ", "This was our strongest quarterly operating margin performance in 28 quarters. This represents the impact of significant internal focus on this measure via our global efficiency improvement initiative, as well as positive benefits from price, mix and currency, partially offset by incremental spending to support our efficiency initiative, as well as lower absorption in the period as we brought down inventory by three days in the quarter, compared with three-day-billed in the second quarter last year.", "Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the second quarter was 60.2% of sales, excluding precious metals and this was an improvement of 170 basis points over prior year. ", "SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 39.1% of sales, excluding precious metals, net down 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2014. The benefits of our global efficiency program are currently skewing more heavily to the gross profit line, rather than the SG&A line at present as is the currency impact. ", "The global efficiency program is increasingly impacting our P&L on a number of areas. I commented last quarter on the increasing momentum of our global procurement initiative and we continue to be pleased with the traction of this effort. In addition, we\u2019re realizing the expected impacts of our earlier restructuring efforts and anticipate accelerating benefits from our more recent restructuring initiatives. ", "In the quarter, we recorded $38.9 million of restructuring and other costs. That\u2019s largely associated with our global efficiency program. The largest impact was from the restructuring of our European laboratory business that we announced in late May. In addition to improving the profitability of this business, this initiative allows us to realign resources on strategic growth opportunities as opposed to less profitable and lower growth non-strategic product lines. As part of the initiative, we are discontinuing some of these low margin non-core products, and in the second quarter, discontinued products deflated internal growth on a global basis by approximately 35 basis points. ", "With respect to our return expectations on restructuring initiatives up this tight, we typically look for ROIs between 20% and 40% on these initiatives. And we expect the savings associated with the European laboratory restructuring initiative to begin to materialize in the back half of the year, with the savings mostly saved in by calendar 2017 with a small incremental amount carrying over into 2018. ", "Our reported tax rate for the second quarter was 32.2%, reflecting the temporary headwind associated with some of the restructuring efforts. Our operating tax rate for the quarter was 22.8%, up 40 basis points above our second quarter rate last year. And as projected, we are seeing a slight continued headwind in tax rate as a result of projected unfavorable geographic earnings mix in 2015 compared to last year. ", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as-reported basis in the second quarter was $44.1 million or $0.31 per diluted share. That compared to $90 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014. These results include a number of items which we\u2019ve listed in the schedules in the release, the most significant of which is the restructuring cost that I described earlier. On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $103.3 million in the quarter, compared to $99.7 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EPS improved by 6% to $0.73 from last year\u2019s second quarter, and currency represented a headwind earnings in the quarter of approximately 5%. ", "Moving on to cash flow, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $145.8 million. That\u2019s down $9.9 million from last year\u2019s record second quarter of $155.7 million, but it represents a 50% increase over the second quarter of 2013. We continue to be very pleased with our cash flow performance, as our trailing 12-month operating cash flow was up 9% versus the previous 12-month period ending June 2014, while our free cash flow yield remains very strong at 6.5%. Moreover, our free cash flow conversion continues to be excellent as our second quarter free cash flow of $129 million represents 125% of our adjusted net income for the period. ", "Inventories finished on 115 days in June. That\u2019s down three days sequentially and down eight days from prior year. We traditionally see inventories creep up in the second quarter, so the sequential improvement this quarter is reflective of our ongoing focus on driving working capital improvements. ", "Accounts receivable were at 58 days in June. That\u2019s flat to prior quarter and on a sequential basis and down one day from last year. ", "Capital expenditures were $17 million in the quarter, while depreciation was $19 million and amortization was$11 million. ", "During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 200,000 shares at an average cost of $51.68 per share. For the first quarter 2015, we\u2019ve now repurchased one -- first half of 2015, we have repurchased 1.9 million shares and our leverage ratio defined as net debt divided by trailing 12 months EBITDA stood at 1.9 times at the end of June. Looking forward, our balance sheet and cash flow generation continue to provide us considerable flexibility to create shareholder value through acquisitions and share buybacks.", "Looking forward, we anticipate the currency headwind to earnings to be a bit more than the $0.07 impact headwind that we experienced in the first half of the year. That\u2019s net of the impact of our cash flow hedges. As you may recall, these hedges helped to partially blend our FX rate over a rolling 18-month period. And while they do not eliminate or reduce the long-term impact of currency changes, they do reduce the volatility by essentially gradualizing these rate changes.", "Finally, as Bret indicated, based on our strong first half performance, we are raising our 2015 earnings guidance \u2013 earnings per share guidance to $2.54 to $2.62 on an adjusted basis. This reflects the strength in momentum in internal growth and our global efficiency program, as well as the additional slight headwind in currency that I just described. I would note that we have a tougher comparison in the third quarter as that was our strongest quarterly performance last year while that comparison eases in Q4. ", "That completes our prepared remarks and we certainly appreciate your support and we\u2019d now be glad to take any questions that you might have. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ", "Nathan Rich", "Thanks. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. First on the lab restructuring, it sounds like you guys can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I think you said it was a 35 basis points drag on internal growth in 2Q. Bret, could you maybe just update on what you have left now that you\u2019ve received the approval to move forward in Germany? And as we think about the back half of the year, should we think about internal growth being maybe higher by a similar amount to that 35 basis points as we think about our models?", "Bret Wise", "Okay, I\u2019m going to take a stab at that and then Chris may have something to add there. Just for reference purposes, we announced back in September last year that we were entering into the negotiations with the works council to restructure the European lab business. Those negotiations took us out till May, so about eight months, eight or nine months we were in a period where the market knew we were going to do something there, our employees knew we were going to do something, but it wasn\u2019t resolved what exactly it would be. So the announcement may allowed us to then move forward and implement the program. ", "In the interim time, there has been a slight drag on growth of this business because the market could see what the options were and start to move away from those product lines that we are likely to discontinue and of course there was confusion or disruption in the employee group because of that also. So this quarter, of course we announced in May and the impact is now known which products exactly will be discontinued, et cetera and the employee base as being [indiscernible] on the products that will go forward. I expect that drag, although I have a hard time quantifying it, I expect that drag from the discontinued products now will actually increase a little bit for a couple of quarters and we\u2019ll probably normalize that sometime after the first quarter next year or so. I don\u2019t know, Chris.", "Chris Clark ", "I concur with that. I think Nathan, the underlying, I would assume that the underlying performance, operational performance of the business would actually improve given the certainty in terms of how we\u2019re moving forward. Obviously, knowing that there\u2019s restructuring that\u2019s being negotiated, that\u2019s uncertain for the employees and obviously the ability to focus on a moving forward basis on really the new business, I think is very much a positive moving forward. The product lines being discounted however there\u2019s now certainty on those and certainly certainty in the marketplace and certainty with customers. I would expect that headwind to continue for the next few quarters and probably a threat, I mentioned increase a bit in terms of the product line discontinuation, offset by really what I would expect to be some improvement in the operating performance, the underlying business as a result of the restructuring, known being known and moving forward.", "Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks helpful and if I could ask one quick follow up. One of the areas of re-investment that you talked about was expanding the sales force. Could you give us any metrics on how big of a piece that is, how many reps will be added, what percent of the total that is? Can you remind us, in the past when you have invested in the sales force, what does the ramp up period look like before the new reps get up to full productivity?", "Bret Wise", "Go ahead, Jim.", "Jim Mosch", "Yeah, Nathan. We\u2019ve taken a review of our global sales organization. Certainly look at some of the areas that we are seeing some good performance and recognize that further investment would give us some upside. More specifically, we\u2019re looking really at the US market and selectively at some of our emerging markets. We\u2019ll make some decision just based on deployment and current levels at to how much that will be. We\u2019re finalizing that at this point in time. From a standpoint of payback for me, it depends on obviously a lot of factors. Market to market segment and obviously quite frankly in some of the emerging markets, the actual cost of a rep, which tends to be lower. But we see a ramp up period of probably 12 to 18 months. We like that to be obviously closer to 12, but that\u2019s a good metric that we look at overall.", "Derek Leckow", "Jim, this is Derrek, Nathan. That\u2019s talking about the earnings implications of the move, right Jim?", "Jim Mosch", "That\u2019s correct. ", "Derek Leckow", "Sales implications happen much earlier than that.", "Jim Mosch", "Sales implication happen immediately, but from a standpoint of us being able to fund the expansion, we typically see that to fully fund that expense or recover that expense, it\u2019s usually a year to year and a half ramp up.", "Nathan Rich", "Have you made a decision on how many reps you\u2019re going to be adding?", "Jim Mosch", "Not specifically, no.", "Nathan Rich", "Okay, thank you.", "Bret Wise", "That\u2019s an on-going program. So as we generate savings, we\u2019ll be deciding. Some of the savings of course are going to drop through in the form of margin expansion, but as we generate savings, that will become part of our normal budget process and in some time, in some instances, it will be mid-year adjustments, off cycles additions. It's hard to telegraph exactly what the number would be at this point.", "Nathan Rich", "Makes sense. Thanks for the questions.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Hi guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. So first question is I wonder if you could spend a minute reflecting on the 2017 margin objectives. It's always nice to hear how the thinking there is evolving and I'd say particularly here, given how strong the margins were in the quarter. Of course we appreciative that you want to continue investing in the business, but then it sort of begs the question, okay, if we have now more flexibility to invest in the business, considering how well we are doing in terms of the efficiency initiatives, then maybe that positions you to think talk a little bit more of how you think about organic growth evolving over the next couple of years. How do you think about the interplay between those dynamics given the progress that you\u2019re seeing here?", "Bret Wise", "This is Bret. I'll take a stab at that. Certainly, we are ahead of where we thought we would be in the margin expansion program. It's beginning to gain traction now, strong traction and that creates flexibility for us, because you might remember, this is not, and you alluded to it in your question, this not just a cost cutting exercises. This is an exercise of taking fixed costs and turning them into variable costs so that we can accelerate investments where we see growth opportunities. That\u2019s probably the most important part of the program frankly, but we are ahead of where our internal targets were on the margin expansion program. That\u2019s going to allow us to bring some of the investments forward and we should generate growth sooner in the program as well.", "I will say, with respect to the 20% operating margin target in 2017, we are ahead of where we thought we would be now. I think you should view that 20% opening margin target as an interim target. We\u2019ll re-assess that target with respect to where we are in the program when we get to that program. Now, we are at 99 for the first six months of this year. We\u2019re doing pretty well which is what's giving us the flexibility to invest in the growth initiatives and move forward. I don\u2019t want to get too far out in front of ourselves here on trying to describe the impact on internal growth, but of course we wouldn\u2019t be making those investments if we didn\u2019t think it would accelerate internal growth going forward. Chris or Jim, you want to add anything?", "Chris Clark ", "No, I think that\u2019s accurate and obviously we are headed where we thought we\u2019d be. We are getting some help from FX on that line, but we\u2019re also getting some good help in terms of the efficiency program. That\u2019s regaining traction and based on the moves initiatives in play, it look like it\u2019s going to accelerate, which is in line with our expectations.", "Jim Mosch", "I would also say there\u2019s transitionally effects too. Obviously as we got through this and we create new territories, we create new positions. We transition businesses. There\u2019s a time phase until those thing become totally efficient. ", "Steve Beuchaw", "Just one follow up to a comment that was made in the prepared remarks for you, Chris. Thanks for calling out the cash flow in the business and how that relates to what's going on in net income. We\u2019ve been wondering about the balance sheet, the extent to which you might, with working capital efficiency, be able to drive faster, free cash flow growth over time. Have you guys thought much about how much or how sustainable that is, the ability to drive free cash flow growth ahead of net income given what you\u2019ve seen on the balance sheet today? Are there any parameter around that that you could share with us? ", "Chris Clark ", "We certainly believe that there\u2019s some suitable improvements possible here for the next several periods. Obviously, it's going to vary quarter to quarter. I don\u2019t want to set the expectation on a quarterly basis, but I think over the next couple of years, you should expect us to continue to make improvements in terms of working capital. We are still in over 115 days of inventory. That\u2019s not exactly world class. That\u2019s better than where we\u2019ve been, but we\u2019ve got some significant opportunities and a number of initiatives in play to drive that down, both in terms of how we operate, but also how we are structured. ", "Again, I think that you should expect to see that gradual improvement, again not necessary quarter to quarter but over time. Again, the fact that historically I think if you went and looked back, last year we improved, we increased inventories in the second quarter by three days. You go back to 2013, I believe they went up by six days in the quarter. To get inventories down by three days in the second quarter, which is typically one of our largest build periods I think is indicative of the traction that we\u2019re getting.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Okay. Thanks again guys. Have a good morning.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Brandon Couillard", "Good morning. Bret, with respect to Europe, if we look back over the last two years, we\u2019ve seen a real I guess saw tooth pattern in the trends there. Realize there\u2019s been several moving parts between CIS and discontinued products, but do you feel comfortable enough at this stage to say we\u2019re perhaps back on more sustainable consistent growth trajectory in that region?", "Bret Wise", "I think that\u2019s an interesting question because the saw tooth pattern, Brandon occurred because of different countries moving in different directions all at the same time, whereas today the pattern is, it's much more consistent, meaning many more countries are moving in the right direction than before there was a balance, more moving down and more moving up, et cetera. Now there seems to be more momentum in more countries. We saw in the results today, we still have countries where there were slight declines in sales growth, but there were many, many more that had slight increases in sales growth and thus it appears to be a more sustainable pattern to us. Now, time will tell. We\u2019ve been surprised before, but I think the region in total seems to be more stable today, seems to be -- they\u2019re still dealing with some issues in Greece and et cetera, but that doesn\u2019t seem to create any contagion to the other countries at this point. It's hard for me to make that call at that point, other than to say what we see right now would tell us that it looks to be more sustainable. ", "Brandon Couillard", "Thanks. That\u2019s helpful, and then maybe one for Jim. I didn\u2019t hear you mention the ortho business. Has there been any change in the ASP environment there and any update you could give us on where you are with MTM in terms of the rollout and the traction you\u2019re seeing there would be helpful. Thanks", "Jim Mosch", "Certainly. Yeah, from the standpoint of the ortho business, I would say that the pattern is pretty similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the past few quarters. The market is still very competitive. I would say that we are seeing some improvement in our North American business. Europe and rest of world still remains very, very competitive. From the standpoint of our MTM business, obviously that is, it is a smaller business, but we are seeing some excellent growth. We are pleased at the case uptake that we see in that business. A lot of it is going to be our continued investment in the clinical education program and our sales efforts to ensure we get continued adoption and increased case volume. But we are pleased with the performance of the MTM business.", "Brandon Rouillard - Jefferies", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we can take our next question from John Block with Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Ethan Roth", "Thanks. This is actually Ethan Roth on for John Block. Maybe first just on the margin expansion, it\u2019s been critical of a story and you\u2019ve exceeded the 2007 goal of 20% in the quarter, which is allowing you to reinvest a portion of the savings fund growth initiatives. I know that you mentioned that you are ahead of plan, but looking beyond 2017, what do you consider to be the peak operating margin for the overall business?", "Bret Wise", "Well, clearly this business can and has produced operating margins above 20% and that\u2019s why we continue to describe the 20% target as an interim target and a net target, meaning it\u2019s net of the reinvestment and it\u2019s an interim target which we would expect to meet on the timeframes we\u2019ve established. But as we get closer to that timeframe, we\u2019ll be able to update that target and the guidance based on the maturity of our efficiency program and what we see the reinvestments generating in returns. So I don\u2019t want to put a stake in the ground on what the maximum operating margins are for this business, but it\u2019s above that 20% target that we have today.", "Ethan Roth", "Okay, great. And then and I know you mentioned that momentum has picked up in the business and the 2Q internal stack growth stepped up a bit sequentially, but your comps get more difficult in the back half of the year. Do you think it\u2019s realistic to think that you can maintain this 3% plus internal growth, just given the momentum of the business?", "Bret Wise", "We don\u2019t publish an internal growth target for the year. Although the reason I went through what we see in the regional markets was to give you some indication of what we see the underlying conditions to be. So at this point, we see stable to improving results in both the US and Europe and that\u2019s, it\u2019s 80% of our sales base, so that\u2019s a big factor. And then the wild card has always been the rest of world countries and there\u2019s 120 countries in that category. So it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to make a firm call on that. But based on the underlying trends that we see in the markets today, we feel pretty good about growth prospects for the back half of the year. And I don\u2019t think I would --We are not too concerned about what the baseline is in making those kind of calls at this point.", "Ethan Roth", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we can take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is open.", "Matt Pfau", "Hey guys, this is Matt. I have a question specifically related to the US market. You\u2019ve seen a little bit of acceleration there. Is that coming from patient traffic spend per visit, or some of the other specialty products? Thanks.", "Bret Wise", "Okay Matt. That\u2019s difficult for us to know what those underlying trends are at the dentists\u2019 office themselves. I mean we buy surveys and so forth and some of those show that patient traffic is improving. But from our perspective, the general consumables, the products we sell through distributors are really the strongest category we have right now and those products really don\u2019t move other than through patient traffic. So that tells us -- I mean if we had to guess, we would say there has been an acceleration of patient visits and these patients are getting back into their office. And generally when that happens, then you see the specialty business pick up on a little bit of a trailing basis. So if we had to guess patient traffic trends have improved from where they were for instance a year ago and with the job growth coming, we would think that that would continue. I don\u2019t \u2013Do you guys have anything to add on that.", "Jim Mosch", "I think that\u2019s right.", "Chris Clark", "That is correct.", "Matt Pfau", "And if I could ask a follow up relative to margin in the quarter. You said price, mix and currency were some of the reasons as to why you got some expansion. Have you guys broken that out as to the contribution?", "Chris Clark", "Yeah. If you look at the 180 basis points in the quarter, a bit over half is currency. Again recognizing that with the cash flow hedges, the impact on our bottom line is less than the translation impact to the headwind on the top line. About a third of it, a little over a third on a gross basis is the efficiency program and pricing mix are helpful, but then we had headwinds from reinvestments and then also headwinds from absorption as I mentioned earlier where again last year we built inventories by three days and this year we brought it down.", "Matt Pfau", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We can take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is now open. ", "Jeff Johnson", "Thank you. Good morning guys. Congratulations on a very good quarter here. Just want to ask on organic growth, I want to make sure I understand. Bret, are you saying that you\u2019re going to absorb some of those inefficiencies as you\u2019ve shut down some of these lab stuff and that\u2019s just going to get absorbed into organic growth? You\u2019re not going to drop that out to any kind of discontinued operations or anything where you\u2019d ax that out of your organic growth rate?", "Bret Wise", "Jeff, we didn\u2019t intend to do that. As those products come out, it does create a slight drag on internal growth. Our plan was to report internal growth to you each quarter and then let you know what the drag was, but we were not going to attempt to normalize it for a product dropping out here or there and we\u2019ve quantified the range of that drag going forward here. Of course that\u2019s a temporary drag because once we anniversary those discontinuances, then that\u2019s going to drop out. ", "Chris Clark", "There are also new products being launched in that business as well. ", "Bret Wise", "Yeah, correct. ", "Jeff Johnson", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I just wanted to make sure so I\u2019ve got my model set up. And then in the US, the 3.9% organic growth, this is going to sound like a very picky comment in the context of a very good quarter, so it\u2019s not meant to be, but a little bit slower than last quarter\u2019s 4.5%. End markets seem to be getting better. Is that just normal fluctuation? Anything to think about there in the US number?", "Bret Wise", "Jeff, that\u2019s a very picky question. ", "Jeff Johnson", "I know it is. ", "Bret Wise", "I think it fluctuates around -- a lot of things can affect that. Dealer inventory is going to affect that and so forth by 50 basis points here. Yeah, 50 basis points to 100 basis points. We\u2019re not troubled by the -- we\u2019re slightly stronger in the first quarter. It\u2019s a little bit, just a little bit weaker here, but overall this year we\u2019re up around 4% organically in the US, probably a little bit above the market. If we had to guess in the market, we\u2019d say somewhere 3 and 3.5 is what the market is growing. We\u2019ll know a lot more than that as we\u2019ve seen more distributors report, et cetera. But we feel pretty about the number. We feel good about the momentum. The execution is good and the seed investments we\u2019ve put in are bearing results here. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re overly troubled by the US number. ", "Jeff Johnson", "Understood and then last question for me just, Jim, anything you can give us by geography on maybe the dental implant numbers? We\u2019re still seeing some nice pick up in North America and maybe you already talked about this. I\u2019ve been jumping between calls, but just any geographic details on the dental implant. Then maybe I didn\u2019t hear you here say anything about the medical business this quarter. ", "Bret Wise", "I\u2019ll take implants. You want \u2013", "Jim Mosch", "Medical, yeah.", "Bret Wise", "You can comment on medical. Implant unit growth was pretty nice for us in the US in the second quarter. If I had to characterize it regionally, I\u2019d say the rest of the world was our strongest region and that followed by Europe and the US. The trends seem to be favorable there. It varies by technology at this point, but we think we are picking up momentum on implant unit placements and that\u2019s being driven by the new product that we\u2019ve been talking about for the last year or so on these calls, ASTRA TECH EV. Did you want to comment?", "Jim Mosch", "Yeah. Jeff, as it relates to the medical business, we are seeing really good mid-single digit growth in that business. We\u2019re pleased with the performance. We\u2019re seeing some nice growth in our US market and in addition we have some fairly significant new products coming in in the coming quarters. So we look for continued improvement in that business. ", "Jeff Johnson", "And Bret, with EV being the main driver and pricing on that product has to be pretty good at this point, you refer to unit growth and I can understand why you might for Asia PAC, but I would assume in US and even in Europe, unit growth doesn\u2019t differ a whole lot from dollar growth?", "Bret Wise", "Yeah, the unit growth does differ a little bit, meaning the point that you raise is important and that is that the price is higher on EV than some of the legacy products. So as the mix shifts to EV, the effect on revenue is a little bit higher than the effect on unit growth. So I\u2019m using unit growth here to give you a perspective on what\u2019s happening to the number of our own dental implant screws that are getting placed, irrespective of which brand it is.", "Jeff Johnson", "All right, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. At this time, there are no additional questions. I\u2019d turn to turn the program back over to our presenters.", "End of Q&A", "Derek Leckow", "Thank you all very much, everyone. That concludes our conference call today.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International\u2019s third quarter 2015 results. I\u2019m joined by Bret Wise, DENTSPLY\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Mosch, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.

I\u2019m going to give some brief overview comments on our results and our strategies and then turn over the call to Jim and Chris for more details on both the operating objectives and the financial results. ", "As an overview, DENTSPLY continues to execute well and consistent with our strategy in a global market that we view as stable. With what we had seen earlier in the year, this market view is generally consistent across most of the geographies, although I would add that the third quarter is always the most difficult read through on trends, particularly in Europe. For DENTSPLY specifically, we\u2019ve been executing on our strategy to first create a significant improvement in the efficiency of our global platform and then once the program gains momentum, to use a portion of those savings to accelerate growth investments. As you\u2019ve seen in recent quarters and I think will be evident again today, we\u2019ve been very successful in significantly improving our margin profile and I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re well ahead of plan that we put forth to you early last year. ", "In order to have us on the same base line, you\u2019ll remember that in April 2014 or about 18 months ago, we announced the global efficiency program with an objective to increase our margin profile to 20%, our operating margin profile to 20% by2017 and that would have been a 240 basis point improvement off of the 17.6% margin we reported in 2013. The second objective of the program and perhaps the most important objective, was then to use a portion of the savings generated above this objective to reinvest in growth opportunities while still meeting or exceeding the operating margin target. The operating margin target was a net target, net of the reinvestment. The results of the program are now very apparent. Using our first nine months of 2015, our adjusted operating margin is at 20.3%. It\u2019s now up 270 basis points from the 2013 base line and has exceeded the interim target of 20% that we set for 2017. We\u2019ve gotten there quite a bit earlier than we\u2019d expected. ", "This quarter, like the second quarter, was very strong with operating margins up 220 basis points and adjusted earnings per share up 6.5% and that\u2019s despite a very big headwind from currency on the topline, but also on the adjusted EPS line. Actually the headwind on currency on adjusted earnings per share was in the mid 6% range. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS, the adjusted EPS improvement this quarter would be well into the double digits. Two other important points on margins. Although currency is a negative on the absolute amount of earnings or operating income, is actually helpful in the percentage operating margin measure. It\u2019s important to note that about a third of the improvement this quarter in the operating margin percentage is from currency. ", "The second important point is thus far in the program we\u2019ve been reinvesting a portion of the savings to facilitate the program itself, that being an investment in systems, consultants et cetera. The need for these investments to facilitate the program will now diminish a bit while the savings will be accelerating. At this point, we\u2019re somewhat of an inflection point in the program where additional funds will be available for growth investments and I\u2019ve asked Jim to give you more of that in a moment in his comments.", "This is an exciting time internally as we\u2019ve been doing a lot of very hard work to get to this moment when we can begin the growth investments in earnest. It\u2019s also important to note that although we\u2019ve designed the program implemented thus far to minimize the impact on the commercial organizations and thus minimize the impact on sales growth, there certainly has been some negative impact. I can\u2019t really quantify that for you, but I think it\u2019s important to note that as we now turn to growth investments, we can help mitigate that impact and more and begin to reap the benefits both on the top and bottom line as we enter 2016. ", "So turning to growth, internal growth in the quarter was a positive 1.7%. Regionally it was up 1.6% in the US, up 0.3% in Europe and up 4.8% in rest of world. I have just a few analytical comments to help you with that. On the global measure, the impact of discontinued products from our lab restructuring was about 50 basis points negative, while the US component of that impact of discontinued products was the largest at 100 basis points. We said on earlier calls that we\u2019ll give you this impact. However, we are not adjusting the reported internal growth for the discontinued products or services at this point. So that headwind is in the reported numbers. ", "In Europe, the reported number is a positive 0.3. This was negatively impacted by the discontinued products by about 25 to 30 basis points. CIS was also still negative. It was down. It reduced the European number by about 30 basis points in the quarter. In rest of world, we were pretty happy with the growth in most of the countries. The one notable exception was the group of countries we call the Pacific Rim, which is included in rest of world, which was up mid-single digits on a reported basis in the quarter. ", "However, this is well short of recent performance and the expectations we had going into the quarter. The main reason for this was the temporary loss of our production facility and our distribution facility in Tianjin, China. Our facility is in very close proximity to the port where the chemical explosion occurred back in August and we did sustain substantial damage and our facility was unavailable for either manufacturing or logistics and shipping for five to six weeks in the quarter. We\u2019re back up with both production and shipping now and we expect this disruption to be temporary. However, it did have a meaningful negative impact on our rest of world growth in the quarter. ", "As we enter Q4, we have a pretty good pipeline of new products coming over the next several quarters and as Jim will note in a moment, we\u2019re now starting to implement our growth investments. Both of these of course should help accelerate our topline moving into next year. Just one last comment. This change towards growth investments for me is really important as we\u2019re now at a point where we have the most flexibility to invest in growth than really any other time since the recession. Now this of course is due to the hard work and dedication of our more than 11,000 employees around the world and we\u2019re all very pleased that we can now move to the next phase of the initiative. ", "On guidance, we\u2019re once again increasing the earnings range for 2015 by bringing up the bottom end of the range by $0.04 and the top of the range by $0.02. This brings us to a new range for adjusted EPS of $2.58 to be at $2.64 for the year. On the operating margin target, of course we\u2019ve already exceeded the goal we set back in early 2014 and we\u2019ll be looking at that and we\u2019ll give you further guidance on the target on our year end call. Needless to say there\u2019s good upside to the target that we had set earlier and of course now achieved. ", "Of course our discussion this morning would not be complete without a few comments on the Sirona merger. As you know, we announced a historic merger with Sirona back in September. This is a very exciting event for both companies, but also for our markets. By bringing together the best in technology equipment and consumables, we believe that we can deliver more innovation and more value to our customers than either company could deliver on its own. We\u2019re of course currently in the process of filing for regulatory approval and have pending shareholder approval for both companies and we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016. Although we\u2019ll not say a lot more about the merger in this call, it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re very enthusiastic about the potential of this transaction and also the future we have together with Sirona and their employees. ", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Jim to speak to our operating initiatives. Jim?", "Jim Mosch", "Thank you, Bret. I\u2019d like to provide an operational update for Q3 and also provide some further perspective on 2015 initiatives. I\u2019ll then turn it over to Chris for the financial review.", "In looking at our Q3 sales performance, our global consumables business grew mid-single digits and we believe above market, with growth led by rest of world, solid growth in the US and also positive in Europe. Our procedural selling programs and new product launches continues to support our consumable business globally. ", "Dental specialties grew low single digits, with growth somewhat impacted by generally slow conditions in Europe, continued price competition in the orthodontics market and contraction in CIS and the specialties. These factors were favorably offset by several new products in our endodontic business, Ortho volume growth in the US, expansion of our line of business and continued good performance with our EV Implant system introduced last year. ", "Our lab business was down mid-single digits in the quarter, which was heavily influenced by the impact of discontinued products. We have outlined previously the global restructuring of our lab business, which includes discontinuing certain commoditized lines, selling some product lines, and or businesses and also right sizing the cost structure away from what had historically been a precious metal based market. The restructuring will be substantially completed at the end of this year. However, there will be an impact through the middle of next year as we anniversary the discontinuation of several product lines. We have now initiated all major elements of the restructuring and are confident that this will lead to improved commercial focus and profitability, driven by a streamlined portfolio and transition to higher growth and more profitable laboratory materials. ", "As we move to Q4, we have several new product launches planned across our businesses. Our restorative business launched CeramX Universal in the month of September and has generated over 1,000 new users. This is a universal composite with natural aesthetics due to a unique sphere tech, spherical filler technology. CeramX provides superior handling without compromising the long term performance characteristics. Also within our restorative group, our Midwest division will launch the Midwest Tradition Plus. The original Tradition high-speed hand piece is one of most recognized and utilized hand pieces in the North American market. The new Tradition Plus incorporates superior features, improved reliability and significant improvements in power, with superior vibration and noise reduction. ", "Our preventive business will launch the Cavitron Touch Ultrasonic scaling unit with Steri-Mate 360. This will be one of the most significant upgrades of our market leading Cavitron Ultrasonic Scaler in several years. The Cavitron Touch will be a much smaller footprint, incorporate a touch screen interface, a lightweight petite cord and superior swivel feature, enabling improved access and ergonomics for the clinician. We anticipate solid uptakes of these products in Q4, but certainly greater impact as these products are rolled out globally over the ensuing quarters. ", "In addition to the products noted here, we have several other product launches planned in the quarter and into 2016, which will be on display at the Greater New York Dental Meeting in November and also the Chicago Midwinter Meeting in February. From an overall perspective, we see the pace of new product launches pick up substantially in 2016. We\u2019re excited about the pipeline of new products coming to market over the next couple of quarters, certainly more than normal products flow. ", "As Bret outlined, we continue to make good progress against our 20% margin operating goal and in some aspects, we\u2019re ahead of schedule. At this point, we would like to provide more detail on our reinvestment initiatives to support long term growth as identified as part of the global efficiency program. As indicated previously, within our manufacturing segments, we will focus on global product platforms by clinical discipline. An important element of this is to translate global portfolio strategies to commercial execution through the regional commercial organizations. Structurally, this requires the addition of in-market expertise by each global portfolio. We are making investments under which each business discipline will have dedicated resources located in the respective geographic markets to support technical market and competitive development and we anticipate staffing more than 50 individuals to support this requirement by the end of Q1 2016. ", "We have also highlighted our commitment to sales excellence, which is training and develop as well as sales force expansion. We continuously review our sales force alignment and deployment and we have concluded to add sales representatives across multiple businesses and geographic regions. We are beginning this activity now and we\u2019ll have some personnel in place by yearend, although the majority of these positions will be filled by Q1. In an effort to support sales expansion and effecting and our sales cores globally, we have launched a global sale excellence program, which will seek to standardize and expand our sales training development efforts on a global basis. A complementary strategy to this is to expand clinical education, which is also underway. With several innovation approaches to design and deployment, this investment will be based on clinically relevant training and education, with a particular emphasis on procedural consistency and enhanced performance. ", "Finally, as we noted previously, we are moving to independent businesses in country to fully integrated DENTSPLY country organizations, which will result in five countries going live by January 1, 2016. While it is early in the process, we\u2019re seeing leverage of critical mass and the collaboration of a single country management team that we believe will accelerate common customer strategies and commercial success as the country organizations develop. ", "At present, it\u2019s safe to say there\u2019s a lot of activity at DENTSPLY. It is both satisfying and exciting that we are now at an insertion point in our efficiency program, as almost an exclusively cost driven focus now becomes more balanced as we turn to investments and growth initiatives. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move forward.", "At this point, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Chris Clark for the financial review.", "Chris Clark ", "Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to provide some detail on our third quarter results by reviewing key elements of our income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement and also provide some additional color on our margin improvement initiatives. For the third quarter, sales excluding metals declined 7.7% compared to prior year as internal growth of 1.7% was more than offset by negative currency translation of 9.1%. ", "Net acquisition growth was negative 0.3% in the quarter. That\u2019s primarily reflecting the impact of several small divestitures of non-core product lines that more than offset the impact from acquisitions. Also as Bret mentioned, the impact of discontinued products reduced the quarter\u2019s internal growth rate by approximately 50 basis points. ", "We continued our very strong operating margin performance in the third quarter as our operating margin rate of 20.9% of sales, excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis, improved by 220 basis points over 18.7% in the prior year quarter. This represents the accelerating impact of our global efficiency improvement initiative, which I will provide more perspective on in a moment. ", "For the first three quarters of 2015, our adjusted margin operating rate of 20.3% represents 170 basis points improvement, over the same period in 2014. Approximately one third of the operating margin improvement this quarter was the result of currency, which continues to be a headwind to our sales and earnings, but is a tailwind currently to our operating margin rate. Currency will become a headwind to our operating margin rate in 2016 if rates remain similar to today, but will be more than offset by savings from the efficiency program. At this point, we would expect margin expansion next year despite this. We will update you more when we report our year end results. ", "Gross profit on an adjusted basis in the third quarter was 60.1% of sales, excluding precious metals and that\u2019s an improvement of 240 basis points over prior year. SG&A expenses on adjusted basis were 39.2% of sales, excluding precious metals, and that\u2019s up 10 basis points, compared to the third quarter of 2014. We are seeing benefits from the global efficiency program in both our cost of goods sold and also on OpEx, with a disproportional amount of the enabling investments also going through the OpEx line at this point in time. ", "As I mentioned, we continue to be very pleased with the progress of our global efficiency program as the P&L impact from our aggregate efforts continues to accelerate. Our initiatives driving these impacts represents significant changes to our structure and to our operational approach and they allow us to better leverage our underlying asset and expense basis. We continue to move forward with implementation of the restructuring of our lab business that we discussed on last quarters call and we\u2019re pleased with the sequential improvement in operational result associated with our actions, as well as the forward looking orientation of that business, now that we\u2019ve moved from planning into implementation. Of course, as mentioned, this is creating a drag on our topline due to discontinued products, but the operational leverage gained is significant and is on plan. The savings from this effort will continue to build over the next several quarters as will the drag on internal growth. ", "In addition, in the third quarter, we closed one additional manufacturing location and announcement the impending closure of a second and this was consistent with our objective of divesting or discontinuing less profitable or non-core product lines, while also driving increased utilization of a smaller number of manufacturing facilities. ", "Our global procurement initiative also continues to gain momentum, allowing us to realize the benefits of leveraging the buying power of a $2.8 billion company, as opposed to smaller decentralized business units. ", "As Jim indicated, we have also largely implemented out global SVU structure, providing increased strategic and operational constituency, while also realizing synergies associated with running our verticals on a global rather than a regional basis. We\u2019re also moving forward with our country operating model in a number of geographies and that allows us to maintain the benefits of our SVU specific sales focus while also realizing the strategic and cost benefit of utilizing common country support structures. In addition to driving operating efficiencies, we believe this will significantly increase the level of collaboration across our businesses and thereby increase the value we can provide to common customers. ", "Finally, we\u2019re moving forward with the consolidation of back office functions, including shared services supporting transactional accounting and also the initial phases of our logistics consolidation initiative. The impact of these strategic initiatives on our P&L on aggregate is accelerating and is a key driver of the strong operating margin performance we\u2019ve been discussing. In addition, this provides us the confidence to now increasingly pivot our focus to also include reinvestments in growth as Jim discussed. ", "Our reported tax rate for the third quarter was 21.1%. Our operating tax rate for the quarter was 22.7%. That\u2019s down 10 basis points compared to the third quarter rate of last year. For the first three quarters of the year, we continue to see a slight headwind in the tax rate of approximately 20 basis points as a result of unfavorable geographic earnings mix compared to prior year. ", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as-reported basis in the third quarter was $84.6 million or $0.59 per diluted share. That compares to $75.3 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014. These results include a number of items which we\u2019ve listed in the schedules in the release. On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $93.5 million in the quarter, compared to $83.9 million in the prior year quarter and adjusted diluted EPS improved by 6.5% to $0.66 from last year\u2019s third quarter performance of $0.62. ", "Currency represented a headwind to earnings in the quarter of approximately 6.5% and the full year impact from currency based on current rates is estimated to be approximately $0.15 per share, which is about a penny per share worse than what our assumption was that was embedded in our initial guidance for the year.", "Moving on to cash flow, our operating cash flow for the quarter was $159.7 million. That\u2019s an 8% increase over last year\u2019s third quarter of $145.7 million. This represents a record third quarter cash flow performance and year to date our cash from operations now stands at $371 million and that\u2019s also a record for the first nine months of the year. Our free cash flow yield, which is calculated by taking operating cash flow less CapEx divided by market cap, was 6.9% at the end of the third quarter. Cash flow conversion continues to be excellent as our third quarter free cash flow of $141.4 million represented 151% of our adjusted net income for the period. ", "Inventory finished with 115 days in September. That\u2019s down four days from prior year. Accounts receivable were -- I\u2019m sorry, were 60 days in September. That\u2019s also down 2 days from prior year and payable days improved by 7 days compared to prior year. Overall we\u2019re pleased with the status of our initiatives to improve working capital performance. Our overall operating results, combined with our improved asset turns, have driven solid results, solid improvements on our return on invested capital performance.", "Capital expenditures were $18 million in the quarter, while depreciation was $23 million and amortization was $11 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 240,000 shares at an average cost of $56.12 per share. The first nine months of 2015, we\u2019ve repurchased 2.1 million shares. Our leverage ratio, defined as net debt over a trailing 12 month EBITDA, stood at 1.5 times at the end of September. We continue to see capital deployment as a driver of shareholder value through acquisitions and share buybacks, supported by our strong balance sheet and cash flow regeneration. ", "I\u2019d like to provide a brief update on the timing of certain filings that we expect to complete in the coming days. In light of the upcoming merger with Sirona and related capital market activities, we will be filing a revision to some historical financials to conform to the segment reporting that we initiated in March of this year. As such, you will soon see a revision -- this revision in the form 10-K that will be filed shortly. In addition, we also anticipate refiling the S-4 Proxy Statement and our form 10-Q for the third quarter shortly thereafter.", "Finally, as Bret indicated, based on our continued strong earnings performance, we are raising our 2015 earnings per share guidance to $2.58 to $2.64 on an adjusted basis. This reflects the strong momentum from our global efficiency program, the cost associated with the growth in investments that Jim mentioned and also a continued currency headwind of approximately $0.04 in the fourth quarter based on current rates.", "That completes our prepared remarks, we appreciate our support and now we would be glad to take any questions that you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operators Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first from John Kreger with William Blair.", "Rob Metzger", "Good morning guys. It\u2019s actually Robbie filing in for John today. Thanks for taking the questions. Just starting on the marketing steps, thanks for the detail and some of the onetime items that impacted growth in the quarter, but even adjusting for those, it seemed like there was a little bit of a deterioration in internal growth. Can you help us understand that? Are you seeing any packets of weakness or any particular areas where things seem to be slowing?", "Bret Wise", "Robbie, I\u2019ll take a shot at that. I think we prefaced our comments by the third quarter is probably the most difficult to evaluate trends in because we have extended vacation periods, particularly in Europe and then also the US can be affected by that as well. I think if you adjust for the discontinued products, the US probably is a little bit light this quarter. We don\u2019t recognize -- we don\u2019t see some overlying trends that caused that. It\u2019s just a few of our businesses were a little bit weaker than we thought they would be. We think that\u2019s probably timing. ", "Europe was only up slightly in the quarter. Of course it was depressed by the CIS, although that\u2019s diminishing. In southern Europe, we saw continued growth. In northern Europe, it was more flattish, but that\u2019s where the impact from the discontinued products is hitting. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any material change in trends there. And in the rest of world category, we were in pretty good shape, except for this disruption we had in China because of the plant, the explosion of the plant at the port. Our plant didn\u2019t explode, but we did lose the access to that plant and the plant was damaged. Those factors would affect the rest of world. So I don\u2019t really -- I don\u2019t read a lot into the trends that we saw. I think the markets are stable and we are looking now to reinvest in certain markets where we see good growth potential.", "Rob Metzger", "Great. And on that point, it sounds like there were a couple of things that you mentioned in terms of new product introductions stepping up next year, rep additions increasing in Q4 and Q1. Can you give us any more detail on that? Maybe just contextualize how many more new products are expected, how many reps you expect to add and then maybe when you expect to see some of these reinvestments and growth to show up on the topline. Will it be a more 2016 event or more of 2017? Thanks. ", "Bret Wise", "Okay, I\u2019m going to take a stab at a couple of those questions and then ask Jim to address the new products. We gave you some insights on the number of technical people we are putting into the markets as part of the reinvestment Jim did this morning. With respect to the rep expansion, we are going to withhold that for now because that\u2019s competitively sensitive, but it\u2019s a meaningful addition that we\u2019ll be going in between now and the end of the first quarter. I don\u2019t think it will have any real effect in the fourth quarter, meaning we have to hire these people, onboard them, get them trained and get them out in the field. So I think it\u2019s more of a 2016 impact at this point, not a 2015 impact. Jim, you have some insights on the new product questions he raised?", "Jim Mosch", "Yeah, absolutely Robbie. From a standpoint, obviously what we outlined is we have a couple of key launches that are happening in Q4 of this year. I mentioned the Midwest can piece and also the new Cavitron. These are equipment products. They have a higher ticket price than our general consumables and it\u2019s always favorable that they have those launching at the end of the year and we expect some good performance from those. Obviously those products will carry going forward. In addition, as we look at next year, I think typically, ideally you\u2019d like to have a situation where you have this constant, consistent stream of new products. ", "The reality is, is that there is somewhat of an ebb and flow to that process. And really what we are seeing right now is, we are seeing a pretty large wave of products that will be coming out in the first quarter. I can say that those are pretty much across all of our segments. We have a couple of notable additions in our healthcare business, also within our preventive business as well. So I believe that what you\u2019re going to see in really the first half of next year is pretty consistent new product additions across all segments.", "Rob Metzger", "Great. Thanks very much guys.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeff Johnson", "Thanks guys. Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Bret, let me just start with you on the topline kind of going back to Robbie\u2019s question. If we do the math and adjust per the China port issue and the lab divestitures, maybe organic growth 2.5%, a little north of that potentially. Probably a little bit below market at this point, although we\u2019ll see when some of the others report here if that\u2019s true or not. As we think about these investments and the new product flow Jim was just talking about, are those investments as we get into 2016, you think to drive the growth rate back up to market or nicely above market? Just how do we judge that and how should we scorecard you guys on that over the next few quarters?", "Bret Wise", "Okay, I\u2019ll take a shot at that, Jeff. At this point the only data point we have is one of the manufacturer that\u2019s reported and that sounded like their growth, organic growth was about like ours for consumables. So we\u2019ll know more of course when we have the two major dealers report and we get a couple of the other industry participants reporting. But I would guess we are close to market absence the things that were specific to us, like the discontinued products and the loss of the plant in China. ", "The new investments, one thing I commented on in my prepared remarks was, we've been fighting this fight since the recession, meaning there hasn\u2019t been robust organic growth which means there is not excess earnings to put into growth initiatives. You might remember when we started this efficiency initiative, one of the major themes was to get our fixed cost down to give us flexibility to put money into growth initiatives. We are at that point now more so than any other point in the period since the recession. ", "So I'm more optimistic now than I have been for probably five or six years that as we get these excess earnings and the ability to reinvest, we\u2019ll drive our organic growth above market. I don\u2019t want to concede that we are below market now. I'm not sure we are. I think that the one data point we've seen thus far says we are at about market right now. But I think the key is some variable spending that will allow us to push that higher and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to start to see as we move into 2016.", "Jeff Johnson", "All right, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then Chris, maybe just a couple of quick P&L clarifying questions. One is, as we think about the FX headwinds to margin rate or margin percentage next year, I know you don\u2019t want to give 2016 guidance, but can you talk just about kind of, are those going to be -- Should we be thinking about 30 to 50 basis points of headwinds from the margin, from the hedge issues or how should we think about the quantification of that?", "Chris Clark", "Yeah, if you look obviously the rates are moving around a lot, so it\u2019s going to be pretty variable. We\u2019ll give you a more formal update when we provide the guidance on the next call. At current rates it would be basically at the higher end of that range that you indicated. And again, it\u2019s -- At this point in time, that\u2019s based on today\u2019s rates and these are highly volatile.", "Jeff Johnson", "Yeah, understood. And then my last two, just I want to make sure the equity and affiliate lines, the $10.8 million, I think all that was excluded. That\u2019s probably a DO adjustment. I think all that was excluded in the non-GAAP EPS. Just want to confirm that. And then what drove the interest in other line down about $7 million year over year and then how did that impact or play into EPS?", "Chris Clark", "There is a couple of things going on there. You\u2019re right; the vast majority of the affiliated equity did pull out in the context of non-GAAP adjustment. That really relates to a transaction relative to DO where we redeemed the convertible bonds. We still are a minority shareholder, but the bonds were on the turn and we made the decision that it was not in our best interest at this stage to go ahead and redeem those at this point in time. Based on that, there are some mark to market elements that float through both that line as well as the interest and other. So those are the bulk of the adjustments.", "Bret Wise", "And those are pulled out.", "Chris Clark", "Those are removed from non-GAAP result, correct.", "Jeff Johnson", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Erin Wilson", "Great, thanks. Can you elaborate on what you\u2019re seeing regionally across the implant business? Have you been seeing any sort of meaningful changes in pricing or competitive dynamics just in light of the consolidation or actually as the disruption or integration processes actually helped you and how do you envision that market kind of evolving over the near and longer term?", "Bret Wise", "Okay, I\u2019ll take \u2013 Jim, you want to take a stab at it?", "Jim Mosch", "Yes, absolutely. Erin, I think form the standpoint of the implant market, I think we would say that it\u2019s been fairly stable over the last couple of quarters. Obviously we haven\u2019t seen a lot of reporting from the other implant players, so it\u2019s a little bit difficult to gauge their results. But overall, like I said we would say that the market has been fairly stable. Obviously the US is probably stronger versus Europe. Europe has been a little bit of a mixed bag, but really hasn\u2019t changed over the last couple of quarters. From the standpoint of the market overall, I think we would expect it to continue at its current pace. It might improve slightly next year. Competitive factors as far as pricing, average sale prices, some pressure on average sale prices, but not significant.", "Bret Wise", "The thing I\u2019d add to that is that our new system continues to get good uptake and it\u2019s a premium system. So we are getting good conversions from that new system at the price point that we got it marketed at. So that\u2019s a favorable data point I think. ", "Erin Wilson", "Okay, great. And you briefly touched on this, but can you speak to just the broader underlying demand trends in the US and how we should think about the quarterly progression here?", "Bret Wise", "Erin, I\u2019d say it\u2019s consistent with what I said before. In the US, August isn\u2019t a really great month to gauge. I would say the quarter probably started a little bit stronger than it finished, but we are talking a few basis points here. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that I would read any material trend into. We are still getting good interest in new products that we bring to market. Our reps I think are doing a good job of maximizing those. So I think the trends are stable as we said in our prepared remarks in the US.", "Erin Wilson", "Okay and just one quick one. What\u2019s embedded in your expectations as far as it relates to the discontinued products in the fourth quarter?", "Bret Wise", "The fourth quarter I think is Christmas in fact.", "Chris Clark ", "It\u2019s accelerating. So as we look at it, we've got -- we obviously don\u2019t provide internal growth guidance basically. But included in our expectations for the quarter is an increasing headwind from the discontinued products.", "Bret Wise", "That will be a little bit heavier in Q4 and Q1 and then by midyear next year it will start to abate.", "Chris Clark ", "It will begin to come back down.", "Erin Wilson", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one for Bret. Bret, I\u2019d like to open the floor up and give you a chance to talk about what it is you\u2019re seeing in your dialogue over the last several weeks with investors as it relates to the Sirona transaction. Where you feel like you wanted to invest or needed to invest the most time to help people understand the merits of the deal, the parameters of the deal just to help people get comfortable as they think about the story.", "Bret Wise", "Steve, we are in the regulatory approval process right now and the process of filing for a trust approval and also shareholder approval. I think on this point we've got to stick to the script that we had at the time we did the announcement. The two companies are still operating independently of each other at this point. And so I think I\u2019d refer you back to the slide deck that we have from the announcement in mid-September. I don\u2019t think we can go any further than that on this call this morning.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Okay, I had to try. Then I\u2019ll ask just two quick clarification questions. One on trend in the quarter. Setting aside the impact of discontinued operations, did you see anything in the channel as it relates to inventory in the distribution channel that might have been impactful on the results of the quarter?", "Bret Wise", "I'm going to start this and Chris if you have something to add. No. I think that we had a price increase October 1, which we do annually on October 1 and we saw kind of the same activity from the channel that we normally do. So no, I don\u2019t think I saw any material difference.", "Chris Clark", "No. Steve I guess I\u2019d add, I think our price increase was pretty similar to the rate it\u2019s been in prior years. Generally in that point to point and a half range. I think the behavior of our distributors was very similar to what it\u2019s been. There are some businesses that might have been a little bit longer or shorter in the context of the pre-buy but those tend to average out. And so I\u2019d say, overall pretty similar impact to what we've seen in the past.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Okay and then last one for me actually relates back to Tianjin. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that it was offline for five to six weeks and I believe you mentioned that that was in August. Have we seen any of that impact recapture and do you have a rough sense for the magnitude of the impact in the quarter? Sorry if I missed that in the prepared remarks. Thanks.", "Bret Wise", "I don\u2019t think we quantified that in the prepared remarks. I'm going to start this and then Chris if you want to quantify you can. The plant got back up and running and also we got availability of the inventory that was in the facility in late September. So we lost a good five weeks, maybe even six weeks, but it occurred, the explosion was in early August and by the time we exited the quarter, we had full access to the facility again. I just want to make clear that in a country like China where we import product into and we hold it in a logistics point, we don\u2019t have the flexibility to do a rush of new products into the country because they\u2019ve got to clear the port. So the fact that we lost access, not only the manufacturing, but to the inventory to ship, is what caused this disruption.", "Chris Clark", "Yeah. I think roughly the difference in trajectory on that business alone had about a 60 basis point impact approximately on the total internal growth number and about 300 basis points on rest of world. So again, it\u2019s hard to tell but if we look at the difference in trends, that\u2019s the impact.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Guys, thanks again. Have a good morning.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from David Stratton with Great Lakes Review.", "David Stratton", "Good morning. I just have a housekeeping question regarding the current liability. That jumped about 40% and I just want to make sure that that is all attributable to the long term debt drop being transitioned into current portion of long term debt. Thank you.", "Chris Clark", "That\u2019s exactly right. Yeah, you got it.", "David Stratton", "All right, thanks.", "Bret Wise", "I would add those liabilities will likely be refinanced.", "Chris Clark", "Yes, Correct. Our intentions are to refinance these in the near term, but they did move in the quarter from long-term to current.", "Operator", "[Operator instructions]. We\u2019ll take our next from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.", "Brandon Couillard", "Thanks. Good morning. Chris, on the working capital front, you made considerable progress of bringing down inventory. Should we expect that trend to level out as you build stocks for the new product launches coming up over the next say six to 12 months? And then could you give us a revised view on CapEx for the year?", "Chris Clark", "Yeah, sure. On the inventory obviously we don\u2019t provide guidance on a quarterly basis, but I guess I would say over a period of time, we've brought it down gradually. I would have the expectation that it continues to come down gradually. We may have an individual quarter where it may stay stable or come up a little bit based on either transitional items, transitional initiatives we have in the near term relative to the margin improvement initiatives, or quite frankly new products as you mentioned. ", "But I guess they\u2019d take a longer time or moderate, intermediate term view on it Brandon to say that I would expect -- we've got considerable room to continue to bring this thing down. Relative to CapEx, at this point in time our CapEx expenditures are relatively modest based on historical trends so far. I think that that is an area again relative to our asset turns that we are focusing on. And I guess I would say for the year, I would anticipate it being in the $65 million to $80 million range for the year.", "Brandon Couillard", "Super. Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Bret Wise", "Thank you all very much for your interest in DENTSPLY. That concludes our conference call. I\u2019ll be around today for follow-ups. Thank you.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference.

Roth - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Operator", "Good day, and welcome to the DENTSPLY International Fourth Quarter Year-End 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Derek W. Leckow - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Vicky. Good day, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss DENTSPLY International's fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 results. I'm joined by Bret Wise, DENTSPLY's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Clark, our President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Mosch, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "I hope you had a chance to review our press release issued earlier this morning. A copy of that release and a set of supplemental slides and information relating to non-GAAP financials are available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.dentsply.com, under the heading Quarterly Results.", "Of course, the Safe Harbor language and U.S. GAAP reconciliation contained in today's press release also pertain to this conference call. We may make forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties that are described in the release and in our SEC filings.", "It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we may make today. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this call.", "With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bret Wise. Bret?", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our year-end call. I will start with a few overview comments, and then I've asked Jim to comment on our new product pipeline and our growth investments. Those growth investments being funded by our efficiency program. And Chris will close with a deeper dive into the financial results.", "Before we start, I have a few comments on our historic merger with Sirona Dental Systems, which was first announced back on September 15 last year. As of today, we've received approval from both sets of shareholders from the U.S. antitrust authorities and also from the Ukraine. We saw a couple of hurdles to clear including the EU. We continue to believe that the merger is on track and will close this quarter. Our team remains very enthusiastic about the possibilities presented by the merger, and we're looking forward to clearing these last hurdles and completing the transaction.", "Beyond this brief update, today's call will be focused on the results of DENTSPLY's business, standalone. Also, as the merger is pending, we will not be providing 2016 guidance at this time but rather we will provide that after the close of the transaction in due course.", "So, starting with our markets, this quarter the U.S. market continued the trends we saw earlier in the year with consistent growth in demand. It's clear that U.S. dentists continue to invest in their practice and remain highly interested in new and innovative ways to improve patient care and their workflows.", "In the EU, we continue to see mixed market development. Overall, we saw some slowing particularly in the north, while there was some improvement in Southern Europe in the quarter. As far as the rest of the world, currency is creating some headwinds particularly for imported products in the many markets; however, for the most part, we see steady demand trends on a local level.", "Moving on to our results for the fourth quarter, top-line growth was once again hit pretty hard by the currency devaluation around the globe. Total growth XPM was down 6.5% on an 8% negative currency impact. Constant currency growth was up 1.5% of which 1.0% was internal growth and 0.5% was net acquisitions, and we had both acquisitions and divestitures in that number, none of which were individually significant.", "Regionally, the U.S. was up 3.1%, Europe was down 2.1%, and the rest of world was up 4.6%. The global internal growth rate disclosed here includes about a 1% drag or headwind from the discontinued products that we discussed on our last call.", "In the U.S., the strongest categories were chairside consumable, dental specialties and our healthcare business, while lab was negative in the mid- to high-single digits. The discontinued products reduced the U.S. growth rate by 120 basis points in the quarter and, of course, that's in the lab segment that I just mentioned. Both the U.S. and European growth rates were impacted by the discontinued products in the quarter, and I'll let Chris provide you more details on that.", "In Europe, we came up against a strong baseline where we grew almost 4% last year in the fourth quarter. In that region, each of chairside consumables, dental specialties and our other category which includes medical were essentially flat, while lab was down double digits. And again, that's driven heavily by the discontinued products in that segment.", "The other factor that continues to hurt us here is CIS which was down high-single digits in the quarter. The currency devaluation happening in that region, as well as the economic situation in the CIS continues to negatively impact the dental market and our results as noted here. Rest of world, as mentioned, was up mid-single digits internally, it's led by Pacific Rim, Middle East, Australia and Latin America.", "Staying with the fourth quarter, our operating margin expanded 220 basis points on an adjusted basis in the quarter and adjusted EPS was up 8% despite a net 8% drag on the bottom line from currency. So, currency neutral, it would have been much stronger, of course. This brought us to adjusted earnings for all of 2015 to $2.62, that's up 4.8% or about 11% on a currency neutral basis. This 2015 result is a couple cents above the high end of the range that we provided at the beginning of the year, and that's despite additional headwinds coming from currency as we move throughout the year.", "So, let's take a step back and look at these results in context. As you know, we've been very focused on improving the efficiency of our business over the past two years. In early 2014, we established a public target to attain a 20% operating margin by 2017 and that was off a 17.6% baseline at that time. In addition, we targeted improvements in asset turns, and as a result, a meaningful improvement in ROIC.", "In 2014, we boosted operating margins by 80 basis points to 18.4%, and this year, we boosted them another 180 basis points to 20.2%. So, for the full year of 2015, we have achieved the target we had set out for 2017, only a couple of years in advance of the target date. At the same time, we were able to improve the asset turns, accelerate cash flow and grew our ROIC from the 8% range at the end of 2011, back firmly into our target zone of 12% to 15% where we exited 2015. This improvement happened without a lot of leverage from market growth, particularly in the EU.", "This required a lot of hard work and creativity on the part of our employees, and I want to thank them for all their efforts they put forth to accomplish this result. We do feel pretty good about these results, although we acknowledge there's been some inconsistency on the top line, and in part, that does reflect some distraction and some disruption from the global efficiency program that we've implemented.", "As we move into 2016, we're now implementing growth investments designed to accelerate internal growth. These investments will be funded from further savings from the efficiency program which is now entering its third year. And of course, this is the exciting part of the program and our employees are highly engaged and energized by the opportunity to reinvest and grow at a faster pace on the top line.", "Before passing the call on for additional remarks from Jim and Chris, I'd like to add that our balance sheet is now in a very good shape. In 2015, we effectively paid down another $240 million on a net debt basis, and our net debt to cap ratio is now in the 27% range and the leverage ratio is below 1.5 times.", "Said another way, I believe we're in very good shape to use our balance sheet more aggressively as we move forward. So, overall we feel like we're in good very place in which to build our future with Sirona. I would add that we are very excited and highly engaged and preparing for our future together with the Sirona employees and executive team. Our pending merger has very high potential and together we believe we can advance dentistry at a much faster pace from single visit dentistry to new and improved packaged solutions and workflows. We truly believe that the new DENTSPLY SIRONA will set the bar very high and be able to drive additional advancements for dentists and patients, increased opportunities for our employees, and of course provide a compelling value proposition for our shareholders.", "With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Jim.", "James G. Mosch - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Bret. I'd like to provide an overview of our R&D efforts, update the status of the global efficiency initiative and outline the resulting reinvestment as part of this initiative. I'll then it over to Chris Clark for the financial review.", "From an R&D perspective, Q4 saw the launch of Ceram.X Universal, a new universal composite with a unique SphereTECH filler technology. Also, the Midwest Tradition Plus high-speed handpiece offering improved reliability, power and noise reduction and the new Cavitron Touch Ultrasonic Scaling Unit providing a smaller footprint, digital user interface and improved ergonomics.", "In addition, earlier endodontic launches of the X-SMART iQ and VDW.CONNECT motor platform and the ProTaper Gold and WaveOne Gold endo files continue to be registered and launched in expanded geographies. Each of these launches exceeded expectations and will carry momentum into 2016. As we look at 2016, new product development will be an area of significant activity. In Q1, we will launch SureFil SDR Plus. This will be an advancement of SDR, the number one bulk-filled global composite, and will provide higher wear resistance, expanded shades and increased radiopacity. We will also launch Calibra Ceram, the next-generation cement-specific for ceramic restorations including DENTSPLY CELTRA CEREC Block.", "In addition, our healthcare business will be entering a new category bowel management with the launch of NAVINA. Often patients that utilize self-catheterization due to spinal cord injuries, cancer therapies and MS also have bowel management issues, which NAVINA provide a unique solution.", "As Bret outlined, we made excellent progress on our global efficiency program launched in 2014. During this time, operating margin has moved from 17.6% in 2013 to a 2015 full year margin of 20.2%. This initiative has touched every area of the business, inclusive of procurement and supply chain, logistic consolidation, key business restructuring, formation of strategic business units, creation of single country organization, and process and system alignment across most functions. We've made great progress, but we have more to do and we will work in 2016 to meet the program objectives.", "While the goal to improve operating margin was a mandate, equally important was the requirement to create funding for investments to drive long-term growth. This is an imperative on what has been a lower growth dental market. We began these investments in Q3 of this year, but they will accelerate as we enter the 2016 budget year.", "In 2016, we will expand R&D investment to address the broader range of projects to drive long-term growth. Additional investment in clinical education programs will expand web and e-learning based program development, as well as program curriculum. We have identified sales excellence as a key driver of share gain. Our investment will support development of global sales training programs, tool development and global CRM implementation.", "Finally, we will invest in sales expansion on a global basis in both developed and emerging markets. In total, we will increase our global sales force by more than 5%, our largest single-year expansion in over a decade. We strongly believe that these investments will improve the top-line growth trajectory of the business, while we seek to further expand the operating margin through the ongoing global efficiency initiatives.", "I'd now like to turn it over to Chris Clark to review the financial results.", "Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to provide some detail on both our fourth quarter and our full-year results by reviewing key elements of our income statement and also by providing some additional color on both our balance sheet and our cash flow.", "For the fourth quarter, sales excluding precious metals declined 6.5% compared to prior year as internal growth of 100 basis points and net impact from acquisitions of 50 basis points were more than fully offset by unfavorable currency translation of 800 basis points. Reported internal growth of 1% was negatively impacted by approximately 110 basis points from product lines that had been discontinued in conjunction with our global efficiency program.", "Gross profit rate on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 58.9% of sales excluding precious metals, and that was an improvement of 150 basis points over prior year. This reflects favorable impacts of our global operational improvement efforts, currency and price.", "SG&A expenses on an adjusted basis were 38.9% of sales excluding precious metals, and that's down 70 basis points compared to our rate in the fourth quarter of 2014, also reflecting impacts of the global efficiency improvement initiatives", "Operating margin for the quarter improved by 220 basis points to 19.9% of sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis, compared to 17.7% in the fourth quarter last year, reflecting the gross profit and the SG&A impacts that I just described.", "Currency represented a headwind to earnings in the quarter of approximately $0.05 per share. It was approximately $0.015 worse than what we anticipated on the third quarter earnings call. This reflects in particular the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and the Swedish krona over that period.", "Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.1%, while our operating tax rate was 23.2%, which was 110 basis points above our fourth quarter rate last year and about 40 basis points above our average operating tax rate for the first three quarters of 2015. This increase in the operating rate for the quarter was primarily the result of unfavorable geographic mix in the period.", "Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International on an as reported basis in the fourth quarter was $58.5 million or $0.41 per diluted share. And that compares to $84.7 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. These results include a number of items which are listed in the schedules in the release.", "On an adjusted basis, net earnings were $92.6 million in the quarter, up nicely from $86.6 million from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.65, up 8% from $0.60 in the last year's fourth quarter. On a constant currency basis adjusted earnings per share increased by approximately 16% over last year. That reflects the significant impact of our global operating efficiency improvement initiatives. We're very pleased with this performance and as we mentioned, are now focusing on driving reinvestments into the growth initiatives that Jim described.", "Transitioning now to the full year 2015. Sales excluding precious metals declined by 7.6% compared to prior year. This internal growth of 2% was offset by headwinds from currency translation of 950 basis points and net acquisitions, divestitures of 10 basis points. Internal growth included the headwind from discontinued products of approximately 50 basis points on a global basis.", "Internal growth for the year in the U.S. was 3.1% including the impact of approximately 75 basis points from discontinued products. For the year, the internal growth in Europe was negative 0.3% which included about 50 basis points from the discontinued products and a slightly larger headwind from the CIS region.", "Internal growth for 2015 and the rest of world region was 4.9%, reflecting internal growth of almost 8% in the emerging markets within that region. For the year, the U.S. comprised 37% of our global sales, while Europe represented 41%, and the rest of world region, 22%.", "Operating margin for the year improved by 180 basis points to 20.2% of sales excluding precious metals on an adjusted basis. And that compares to 18.4% last year. This reflects the full year impact of our global efficiency program, as well as the currency benefit moving through our cash flow hedges. On an adjusted basis, net earnings for the year increased to $373 million from $361 million in 2014, and adjusted earnings per share grew by 5%, to $2.62 per diluted share in 2015, from $2.50 per diluted share in the prior year.", "Our results for the year include the negative impact from currency of approximately $0.16 which is about $0.02 worse than what we anticipated in our initial guidance for the year. On a constant currency basis adjusted earnings per share for the year increased by approximately 11% over 2014, and we're very pleased with this operating performance for the year.", "Moving on to cash flow, we're also pleased with our operating cash flow for the year of $497.4 million, although this trails 2014's record $560.4 million. Our cash flow performance reflects comparative headwinds versus prior year from four items. The timing of cash tax payments, payments associated with the restructuring plan, acquisition and merger-related cost and also the prepayment of the long-term bonds that we refinanced in December.", "Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $425 million for the year, and our free cash flow conversion was 169% of reported net income for the year. As of year-end, inventory stood at 110 days which is down 5 days compared to September and down 3 days compared to December 2014. This was a pretty solid inventory performance for us in the quarter, although as a result, we had lower absorption in our plants and slightly higher cost in inventory as we come into the new year.", "Account receivable days were 54 days at the end of December, that's down 6 days from prior quarter and down 1 day compared to December 2014. And the improvements in primary net working capital contributed $40 million to cash flow for the year, and that's on top of $38 million contributed in 2014. So, as I've indicated on previous calls, we believe we can continue to make significant progress over time in the net working capital area as a result of the global efficiency improvement efforts.", "Capital expenditures for the year totaled $72 million; depreciation was $79 million for the year while amortization was $44 million. We did not execute any share buybacks during the fourth quarter. For the full year the company repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares at an average price of $52.50 per share.", "We ended 2015, as Bret mentioned, with a pristine balance sheet as net debt to capital now stands at 27.1% at year-end compared to 32.3% at the end of 2014. And our leverage ratio of net debt-to-EBITDA now stands at 1.45 times compared to 1.87 times at year-end 2014. This obviously provides us tremendous flexibility as we move into 2016 on a combined basis with Sirona.", "As we move into 2016, we are pleased with the operating performance of the business, particularly the traction from the efficiency program and now our ability to translate that into growth investments in addition to operating margin improvements.", "A headwind to keep in mind is currency. And while rates are fluctuating rapidly, at current rates, we would anticipate a headwind to earnings of the DENTSPLY stand-alone business in 2016 of between 5% and 7%. Currency also flips from being a tailwind to operating margin rate in 2015 to becoming a headwind to that ratio in 2016. While, as Bret mentioned, we're not providing guidance at this time, I would state that we would expect positive year-on-year operating margin rate performance in 2016 despite the impacts from the currency and the growth reinvestments that were discussed earlier.", "That completes our prepared remarks. We appreciate your support. We'd now be glad to take any questions that you might have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We'll go first to John Kreger with William Blair.", "John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks very much. Bret, could you talk a little bit more about how Brazil and China are doing and maybe kind of the more emerging markets in general? Are you seeing any signs of deterioration given all the headlines we've been seeing?", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, John. I'd be glad to do that. I would say that China remained stable and a growth market for us. We haven't seen a lot of movement or weakening. It seems like dentistry is still kind of an emerging profession in China. The number of dental schools there that have opened is significant. The number of people entering the profession is significant, and dentistry is moving from kind of a street corner profession into a professional environment. So, the growth there is still good.", "We saw continued growth in the quarter in Brazil as well, although we're watching that economy very closely. I'd say for us, that's a little bit higher risk than the Chinese situation at this point, although we continued to perform pretty well during this most recent quarter.", "Emerging markets in general, I would say, are stable. The one exception to that is the CIS region which is kind of getting hit very hard on two sides. One is on the currency, and the other is on the economics coming from the dependency on oil. And that market continues to contract. But outside that region, I would say, the emerging markets still look stable to us and they're growing.", "John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you. That's helpful. The other question I had, if you think about your organic growth in the quarter of 1% \u2013 you talked a lot about new products. Could you sort of break that growth down between, let's say, price kind of your legacy line and what kind of contribution you think you got from new products in aggregate in the quarter?", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't have that kind of an analysis at my fingertips. And then I frankly don't think we do break it down that way. I will say that on the quarters \u2013 the growth for this quarter, the disappointment for us was Europe which was weaker than we had anticipated. And as I stated in my opening comments, it was more Northern Europe than Southern Europe this time that kind of disappointed us.", "The other thing that's holding our growth rate back, of course, is those discontinued products in the lab sector. But as far as quantifying the amount coming from new products, I don't have anything that would allow me to give you that at this point.", "Chris, you have anything...", "Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer", "No, I don't.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I apologize for that but that's not something we have at our fingertips.", "John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Bret, just following up, I guess, on your last point there. I mean, can you dig in at all in trying to figure why or try to give some reasons why Europe was disappointing this quarter? It seems like with some of the general consumables numbers out there from the distribution side that market held in fairly well. So, any color you can provide there on Europe?", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The two data points I have at this point are, one, the very large manufacture came out with, what they said, was low-single digit growth or close to zero growth. And we don't know, but I'm presuming that was impacted by Europe, because I would think their U.S. number would have been reasonably strong. So, the data point I have is our number, that manufacturer's number and then one distributor's number, I don't have any other distributors.", "The one distributor that's out had very strong growth in their rest of world category, I don't know the breakdown between Europe and other regions. But if the implied European growth rate is close to what the rest of the world growth rate was, then I would say that was clearly above market. The other factor for us, of course, is CIS plays a pretty big role in our European number, and I'm not sure that it plays much of a role in the other numbers that we've seen out there at this point.", "James G. Mosch - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "I'll also say, our base was pretty strong. We're going up against.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "True. We had 4% baseline from the prior year. So, that's the color I can give you on that, Jeff, at this time. I do view that market as kind of flattish for the most part. Outside the lab sector, we were kind of flattish in most of our categories, so I think it's just a slow market right now or continues to be a slow market.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Understood. And I know you guys don't guide organic growth, you're not even \u2013 obviously, not providing guidance today, and you don't historically provide organic growth guidance anyway. But as Jim talked about some of the sales force investments that will be going in or sorry maybe that was Chris but as the discussion on the sales force investment some of the other things, would it surprise you over the next twelve months as a standalone company if organic growth didn't accelerate to a certain extent and to a decent extent at this point?", "Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I got a couple of comments on that and I'll pass it over to Jim. The region economically seems to be kind of a constant state of flux and we see that for comments coming out of the EU. In general, I would say that the dialog we have with our general managers in Europe is not negative, it's positive. So, they are still upbeat. They see opportunities to grow. I would like to see that come through our numbers as we move into next year.", "Jim, I'll let you comment on reinvestments, what impact you think?", "James G. Mosch - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks. Jeff, yeah, I think one of the things we see and I think one of the benefits of the global efficiency program is the ability to make long-term investments. I think oftentimes you're in a situation where you're making investments within a year with the hopes of seeing a return in that year, those investments quite frankly are difficult to find. The global efficiency initiative has allowed us to make those longer term investments like sales force, like clinical education programs. The reality is those things have a pretty significant ramp. We don't see sales reps paying back in less than a year. Sometimes it takes time for them to get training up to speed. We can expect maybe a little bit of a lift but, overall, it is an operating investment certainly in this year. But, obviously, the longer term prospects are very good and those have been the kind of investments we need to make.", "Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I'll just add to that that, although, they don't breakeven in the first year, you do start to see some sales growth come out of them probably in the back half of their first year. It's just not sufficient enough to cover the fixed costs.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Correct.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And my last question, just can you remind us the timing here of when some of the headwinds from these divested products start to fall off, I think it's midyear, I just want to make sure as I'm building out the model, that's the accurate way to look at it.", "Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Jeff, it's Chris. Some of those will come off midyear, some of those larger ones actually will start peeling off late in Q3. So, again, they're kind of staggered, but the anniversary, basically, again, midyear to late Q3 timeframe at this stage in the game.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer", "You bet.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.", "Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Sorry to go back to Europe, but just wanted to ask on the impact of discontinued products on Europe in the quarter specifically, I'm not sure if you guys gave that in the prepared remarks.", "Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. It was just over 100 basis points for the quarter.", "Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up to that, I'd be interested to get your thoughts on whether you think the discontinued products in lab or having any sort of residual or cross-over impact to other categories, I just wanted to know if this might be weighing on growth.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think it would have a lot of cross-over impact into other non-lab categories. But the restructuring we did in the lab category itself, including the discontinued products, could have, for a short period of time, some disruptive effect on other products in the lab category. But I don't see much possibility that it would stream over into other areas of the business.", "Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Sure.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with UBS.", "Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Steve.", "Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC", "My question just in relation to any upcoming 2016 guidance, and you did mention previously that the Sirona merger would be modestly accretive in the first year. I guess when you do give that guidance, I'm just curious, should we still assume, first of all, that that prior notion of modest accretion will still hold, and then do you know yet whether you'll quantify it or will this be kind of a sort of that general qualitative commentary around the accretion? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of what to expect when you guys do provide that. Thanks.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I don't have details on what will be provided at a later point. That will be based on agreement of the new management team and so forth. Timing of transaction close \u2013 uncertainty of timing of transaction close weighs on that question of whether you get accretive in the first year or not because it does take some time to ramp up the synergies. But at this point, I think it's fair to say we believe we're close to a close date, and we believe the best pathway for us here, for the combined management team, would be to defer on the guidance and bring that out after we've closed in due course and had time to work together on it.", "Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Then the other quick one, just in the press release you mentioned that you stated that the business is performing well fundamentally and see opportunities to accelerate the top-line growth as you move in to 2016. Just curious how much of that is maybe your own programs versus just what seems to be a fairly evident trend now that the overall industry is enjoying some accelerated top-line growth. Your comment there is sort of a combination of both of those or just curious to get what your thoughts on that as well? Thanks.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, that comment was meant to leverage off the fact that we're putting these reinvestments in now, which as Jim noted is probably the largest reinvestment for growth that we've had in this company for some time, maybe close to a decade. So, that was more driven towards the fact that we have some options that are within our own control now to invest for growth and we would anticipate we will see some pick up from that in a short period of time, certainly by the time we exit 2016.", "Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. I think just for the U.S. market in particular, there had been a lot of other companies in the dental sector that have talked about an expectation of the acceleration of organic growth for 2016 just from the \u2013 just the macro trends. Do you endorse that view right now for U.S. specifically, or do you not want to make that prediction right now?", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I wouldn't be surprised if that happened. The dentists today seem open to listen to new ways to invest in their practice and drive their own productivity or improve patient outcomes. And you see that evidenced in the growth rates that the dental companies are experiencing in the U.S. I wouldn't be surprised to see it accelerate because of overall macro trends. Although when you read the Wall Street Journal, and you wonder what the macro trends are really going to be for the next year.", "So, again, our comments were \u2013 our view is we're trying to improve our position despite what the market does. And these reinvestments I think will do just that, allow us to grow above market irrespective of what the macro trends are.", "Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel.", "Ethan T. Roth - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great. Thanks. This is Ethan Roth on for Jon Block. I have two questions here. The first is on rest of world, I think we were a little bit surprised to see the internal growth not pick up from last quarter when you called out a temporary loss of production at a facility in China. I think we had that maybe about 300-basis-point drag. Did that swing back the other way and positively impact your growth this quarter as some of the product went out the door?", "Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer", "No. Ethan, it's Chris. I would say it was a pretty normal quarter for us relative to China. I mean we're back in production. We probably did lose some sales over that period of time as customers probably went to other brands during that brief period we couldn't supply. But no, we didn't really expect nor did we see, I would say, an incremental snap back. We saw a return to, what I would say, to be pretty normal consumption. If you look at the high 4%s in terms of internal growth rate for the rest of world region, that's pretty much what that region has been doing on average over a reasonable period of time here.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Kind of mid-single digits. And we need to keep in mind that when we say rest of world, it includes many developed markets, not only emerging markets. So, there's a balance there between the two categories in that number.", "Ethan T. Roth - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Great. And the second just more of a housekeeping question. I noticed acquisitions were actually a net benefit this quarter, whereas you've had some divestitures that were a drag to the first part of the year. Can you share with us any details on either what the acquisition was by product or in which geographies? Thanks.", "Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. We purchased a small prosthetics business in Latin America.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. That was driven by one single acquisition that's now offsetting the divestitures, none of which were really material individually.", "Ethan T. Roth - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.", "Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Hey, guys. It's actually Michael Clerico on for Steve today.", "Bret W. Wise - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Michael.", "Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Could you just quantify \u2013 hi, guys. Could you just quantify the benefit from currency on the operating margins this quarter as well as the \u2013 what was the drag from CIS on European growth?", "Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Relative to the quarter, about a fifth of the operating margin improvement was related to currency.", "Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay.", "Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer", "The rest again \u2013 the significant amount came through as a result of the global efficiency improvement program as I noted.", "And I'm sorry, Michael, the second question?", "Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah. And the drag from CIS on the European growth rate?", "Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer", "For the quarter \u2013 I'm sorry. It looks like about 50 basis points maybe, maybe 50 basis points to 60 basis points, in that range.", "Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it.", "Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then my second question, on working capital, you've made some nice improvements. Could you talk a little bit about going forward on standalone basis efforts to keep that improvement up and things that you're doing? If you could just comment on what the initiatives there are and how you view that going forward?", "Christopher T. Clark - President & Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. Again, there's a significant focus in this area. I think we talked about that it in previous calls as well. Number one, these metrics \u2013 we've had metrics in place from a management standpoint to focus in on that. Again, that's certainly \u2013 those targets have \u2013 I think that focus has helped.", "Secondly, as part of our global efficiency improvement program, the synergies associated with reducing distribution points moving to coordinated global inventory planning and control, again, all those common processes, point rationalization as appropriate, I mean, these \u2013 all these movements significantly streamline and simplify a pretty complicated supply chain.", "So, again, we believe that there's still significant room to go. This is a gradual effort. I don't think you should measure it on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but you should measure it over multiple quarters and expect continued progress. And, again, we're pleased with the progress thus far. But, again, we're early in the mid-innings in terms of that metric at this stage in the game.", "Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We have no further questions in queue. So at this time, I turn the call back over to Derek Leckow for any additional or closing comments.", "Derek W. Leckow - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Okay. Thank you, all, very much for your interest in DENTSPLY. That concludes our conference call, and if you have any further questions, I'm around today for follow-up. Thank you. Good-bye.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference.

Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Operator", "Good day and welcome to the Dentsply Sirona, Inc., First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being record.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joshua Zable, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communication. Sir, you may begin.", "Joshua Zable - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 conference call. I would like to remind you that an earnings slide deck presentation relating to this call is available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com.", "Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements on slides two and three of our earnings slide presentation. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We take these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.", "And with that, I'll now turn the program over to Jeffrey Slovin, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Josh. It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our first quarter and first ever conference call as Dentsply Sirona. Also joining us on the call today, Ulrich Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Chris Clark, President and Chief Operating Officer of our Technologies business; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "I'm delighted to report that our first quarter was a very successful one. We seamlessly completed our merger and begin working on the great opportunities ahead of us. Rather than being distracted by the merger, the team came together and was energized to perform.", "In our first 67 days together, Dentsply Sirona team has much to be proud of. We've rebranded our company, announced our leadership team, and created an operating model to help optimize our growth. As you can see on the earnings presentation, we have organized our self into two segments: Dental and Healthcare Consumables; and Technologies.", "Our Dental and Healthcare Consumables business is comprised of our endodontics, preventive, prosthetics, restorative, and instruments division, along with Wellspect, our healthcare business. Our Technologies business is comprised of our implant, CAD/CAM, imaging, treatment center and the orthodontic businesses.", "We organized these segments to maximize efficiency and product development and cross-selling opportunities. In addition to developing new stand-alone products, our segments will introduce integrated solutions to improve workflow in advanced patient care.", "Within Technologies, our loyal install base of CAD/CAM and imaging has been expanding to incorporate more specialty procedures. For decades, we have a proven track record of using technology to allow the dentists to advance patient care, both in terms of outcome and treatment times.", "Now, we are moving towards integrated solutions, using technology combined with clinical products to provide dentists with end-to-end solutions and advance their own service capabilities. This was first evident in restoratives, but is now moving rapidly into implants, orthodontics, and endodontics. These capabilities, further facilitated with Dentsply Sirona's world-class clinical education platform, creates a powerful basis for advanced learnings in clinical settings.", "Along the same lines, specialists are demanding more high-tech equipment, like 3D imaging and digital impressions. Our relationships with these practitioners will help drive adoption of our technologies.", "From a product development standpoint, combining the experience and knowledge of our strategic business units, will enable the development of integrated technologies. Furthermore, by collaborating innovation should come faster and offer more to practitioners than ever before.", "In Consumables, the majority of our revenues are operatory-related and often used in conjunction with one another. We are focusing on offering practitioners end-to-end solutions based on particular procedures. All root canal procedures require multiple tools and are completed with restoration. Dentsply Sirona is the only manufacturer with RestoDontics strategy, offering all the necessary instruments, equipment and consumables to diagnose and complete a root canal from start to finish.", "As you can see, the goal of organizing into these segments was to accelerate adoption of all of our products, which will translate into top-line growth.", "By driving growth and increasing productivity of our sales and service infrastructure, we will leverage our sales to deliver strong bottom-line growth as well. With so many opportunities ahead, we have created an integration management office to work hand-in-hand with senior management to oversee the seamless merging of both companies and cultures.", "In order to capture our synergies, we have formed multiple teams to actively manage our cost of revenue initiatives. Feedback from these teams have been overwhelmingly positive. Ideas are being shared across organizations and plans are being implemented to ensure these synergies come to fruition. We are confident that we can deliver on our promise of $125 million in synergies by year three of our merger.", "Capital allocation will also be important part of our go-forward strategy. Our company generates a significant amount of free cash flow and we have a large and flexible balance sheet. As always, our priority is to invest in growth drivers for our business. We will also use our cash flow to make acquisitions, repurchase our stock and support our dividend.", "During the quarter, we executed on the $500 million share repurchase, consistent with the announcement we made at the time of the merger. We continue to have 3.6 million shares authorized for repurchase. We have flexibility to pursue multiple avenues of capital deployment, all of which will drive value for our shareholders.", "The opportunity ahead of us is more significant than anything, either Dentsply or Sirona ever had on a stand-alone basis. We have never been in a better position to grow and deliver shareholder value.", "Turning to the first quarter, Uli will explain some of the technicalities on the reported revenue growth. I will focus my comments here on the underlying growth of our two combined businesses. Although the merger closed on February 29, I think it is more meaningful to discuss the performance of our business during the full quarter.", "We achieved strong results, with our combined businesses growing 6.5% constant currency. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products, internal sales growth was 5.5%. Geographically, we have solid growth across all regions.", "Rest of World led our growth, delivering 8.4% constant currency, driven by internal sales growth of 7.5%. There continue to be a number of challenging environments around the globe, but we are much better positioned after the merger in these areas. We expect our Rest of World region to be the fastest-growing region this year.", "The U.S. grew 8.8% constant currency, driven by internal growth of 5.7%, led by the Technology segment. Europe grew 3.1% constant currency, with internal sales growth of 4%, driven by solid growth in both our Technology and Consumables segments.", "On a segment basis, our Technology business led our growth with 9.6% constant currency growth. Internally-generated sales grew 6.8%, led by strong growth in our high-tech products. CAD/CAM was particularly strong ahead of our new Zirconia product launch. In Q1, Dental and Healthcare Consumables generated internal sales growth of 4.5%. Growth was driven by operatory-focused consumables.", "First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.69, representing 17% growth. We achieved strong financial results while investing in R&D and in our sales and service infrastructure. We will continue to ramp these investments in Q2 to better position our accelerating growth. Innovation and best-in-class customer service will be two key pillars of our new organization. Overall, we reported a very solid first quarter.", "I'll now turn the call over to Uli, who will review our first quarter financials.", "Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss our GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP results, including the sales performance of our combined businesses for the complete three-month period of the first quarter 2016 as if the businesses had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. I walk through the earnings performance. I will also point out any impacts of merger accounting on earnings.", "In the first quarter, our reported revenues increased $116.3 million to $772.6 million, up 17.7% reported. The consolidation of one month of Sirona contributed sales of $128.9 million, which were reduced by $8.8 million to $120.1 million as a result of purchase accounting.", "This reduction from our normal revenue recognition practices results from a one-time treatment of deferred income on service contracts, where any deferred income at the time of the merger is removed from future revenues and income. This one-time treatment reduced revenue by $8.8 million this quarter and will reduce future revenue by about $8 million in the aggregate over the next six quarters.", "As of March 1, any new contracts are again being treated as they have been historically. For non-GAAP reporting, we will treat all the contracts existing at the time of the merger under the ongoing policy as if incurred in normal course of business.", "For the full three-month period ending March 31, 2016, adjusted sales of our combined businesses excluding precious metals grew 6.5% on a constant currency basis, internal growth was 5.5%, excluding 1.7% favorable impact from net acquisition and 70 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were a headwind to revenue of 2.6%.", "Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth for the complete quarter come together.", "U.S. GAAP gross profit was $418.9 million, up $45.5 million from $373.4 million in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 360 basis points to 55.5% from 59.1% in the prior year.", "As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by about 500 basis points due to the roll-off of merger-related fair value adjustments. The company generated benefits from its global efficiency program which were largely offset by negative foreign currency impacts.", "Reported SG&A expenses, which include R&D, was $342.1 million, up $71.8 million versus last year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metal, increased 250 basis points compared to prior year. Merger-related expenses negatively impacted the rate by about 500 basis points, partially offset by savings from the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona.", "SG&A expenses were favorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately 100 basis points. Restructuring expenses were $4.1 million, down $1.3 million from last year.", "In total, GAAP operating income was $72.7 million, representing 9.6% of sales, excluding precious metals. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, the adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, which compares to 18.7% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona.", "Due to the strong performance in March, the benefit from the consolidation is more pronounced. Had we consolidated Sirona for the complete three-month period, our adjusted operating margin would have been approximately 150 basis points lower. We believe this is more representative of the current performance level of our business.", "Net interest expense for the first quarter was $8.7 million, $1.3 million lower than prior year, largely driven by lower average debt levels. Other income in the first quarter was $3.4 million, with the biggest impact coming from a small business divestiture, which was removed from adjusted income.", "For the three months ended March 31, 2016, income taxes were a net benefit of $57.9 million versus an expense of $18.9 million last year. As part of the merger, we will be able to generate an early synergy by recovering previously reserved tax assets of $76.1 million. This is the single biggest driver of the favorable development and will be recovered in cash in future periods. We have removed this benefit from our non-GAAP results.", "As a result, Q1 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona was $125 million, up 95.3% from the prior year. First quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.70 compared to $0.45 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up 16.9% from last year. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS please see our earnings press release.", "Cash flow from operating activities during the three months period ended March 31, 2016, was $0.7 million compared to $65.6 million during the three months period ended March 31, 2015. The year-over-year decrease was primarily related to a $56.9 million larger increase in accounts receivables due to stronger revenues in the month of March and payments of approximately $40 million of merger-related transaction fees and integration costs.", "Cash provided by investing activities was $504 million favorable, which reflects the assumed cash in the merger with Sirona of $522.3 million. These funds were largely used to execute the $500 million share repurchase which, in exchange, is a major driver behind the $472.8 million cash used in financing activities. The company's cash and cash equivalents increased by $38.5 million to $323.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016.", "Now, turning to guidance, for fiscal 2016, we expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following assumptions: constant currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%, excluding precious metals. This includes a 1% benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products and internal growth in the range of 3% to 5%.", "At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues, excluding precious metals, of $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. Please keep in mind that growth comps get more difficult in Q2 and Q3 related to last year's record international dental show and strong performance in our consumables business.", "At the current exchange rates, we would expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our EPS range implies a full-year share count of 220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares. Our share count will increase to 238 million as we move into Q2.", "I will now turn the call back to Jeff.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Uli. We are in the very early days of our journey as Dentsply Sirona, but we have a lot to be excited about. The key driving force behind our merger was growth. By accelerating the adoption of our products, we can bring about the full impact of digital dentistry in the dental practice. We can integrate equipment and consumables to meet the growing need for more efficient workflows. We will set new standards of care while meeting the growing demand for end-to-end solutions.", "At Dentsply Sirona, we are the only company that can further drive these trends and are best positioned to benefit from them. Our installed base of equipment is the largest in the world. Our customers are loyal and supportive. They understand that our products are built to help them become more successful, which is driving our growth.", "Every day, around 600,000 dental professionals use Dentsply Sirona product. Our reach is unparallel, and our brands are the most well-known in the industry. Dentsply Sirona is associated with quality and innovation.", "We have the broadest clinical education platform in dentistry. Each year, we train more than 300,000 dental professionals on our products. Training builds loyalty to our company and our products, especially when they make procedures easier or more efficient.", "We also are able to deliver all of our offerings around the globe with largest sales and service infrastructure in the industry. We are supported by 4,000 sales professionals and around 5,000 distributors around the globe. We also heard combining all of our capabilities create synergy opportunities. From a cost perspective, coming together will create opportunities to leverage our supply chain and cost structure.", "Building off the legacy Dentsply efficiency program, we already have a platform to evaluate opportunities and the team to execute on them. We are evaluating ways to improve our processes and manufacture more efficiently. We have begun cutting redundant corporate expenses and consolidating some of our countries. All of these actions will generate tangible cost savings and create a more leverageable cost structure. We expect to achieve these savings while continuing to invest in R&D and our sales and service infrastructure.", "With more innovations and farther reach, we can cross sell to our mutual customers or create bundles that specifically cater to each customer. We have been working closely with our distributors to develop plans that create growth opportunities for ourselves and our partners.", "Some of these successes involve sales people coming together to move the combined business forward. We already have a number of stories from the field, of reps introducing customers to our expanded portfolio. We have a large sales organization around the globe and they've been meeting to find more ways to collaborate and accelerate growth while working with and respecting a wide range of distributor relationships that we have in place.", "These are win-win scenarios for Dentsply Sirona and our distribution partners. The more significant opportunities will require investment in both R&D and infrastructure. While these take time and will mean that some of our revenue synergies are backend loaded to our third year, we are extremely confident that we can deliver them and they will be significant.", "While these integrated solutions are in development, our R&D engine is continuing to introduce innovation to drive penetration of our products. We've recently introduced a number of new meaningful products to the market. Our SureFil SDR+ builds on our revolutionary market-leading bulk fill composite platform. The product has enhanced radiopacity in interproximal layer.", "In our Healthcare business, the new Navina bowel management system provides a novel approach to irrigation in a rapidly expanding market. Early feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.", "During the quarter, we launched our CEREC Zirconia package, which was well received by the market. The Zirconia package includes the new CEREC SpeedFire, our unique high speed sintering furnace and combination with the CEREC chairside CAD/CAM system. It allows for a single visit dentistry of Zirconia crowns and small bridges. In the past, using conventional furnaces, Zirconia needed about two hours for sintering. Therefore, Zirconia was exclusively processed in the dental lab.", "CEREC SpeedFire brings sintering time down to about 15 minutes and opens up the possibility of processing Zirconia chairside. Zirconia is the most popular ceramic material for crowns in the U.S. Having this material available for CEREC will substantially expand the addressable market for CEREC.", "In conjunction with our launch, we also introduced CEREC chairside Zirconia blocks and our new Calibra ceramic cement, a first Dentsply Sirona cement to address CAD/CAM restorations. As part of our launch, we also provided a materials and accessories starter kit for all new users of Zirconia packages.", "Combining these new products with our CELTRA Duo blocks means that we can now offer dentists the tools and materials for all of our chairside restorations. And to complement this, we have outstanding relationships with our material partners that we'll continue to build on.", "We will continue to invest in new CEREC consumables specialist sales force to work hand-in-hand with our equipment specialists to deliver a full value proposition to dental professionals. They now can source all of their CAD/CAM needs from Dentsply Sirona. Our efforts are already paying off. Our CELTRA and Zirconia lines are growing rapidly. This is the first example of Dentsply Sirona's leadership in both equipment and consumables coming together to drive growth globally.", "We will continue to launch over 30 new products every year. Our new product pipeline is robust. We provide best-in-class equipment and consumables. We can accelerate adoption of technology and drive sales of our entire product portfolio.", "We have a number of additional opportunities to quickly integrate our technology and consumable offerings. Orthodontists are rapidly adopting 3D imaging and digital impressioning systems. We have the most open orthodontic camera on the market, and we can benefit from our seamless integration with our own MTM Clear Aligner brands.", "Coupled with our brackets and wires, orthodontists can now treat a patient from diagnosis to treatment. From the initial x-ray to impression and then to treatment, orthodontists can choose from an array of Dentsply Sirona products to effectively treat patients. With CEREC meets 3D, we offer the safest and easiest chairside implant planning.", "As I mentioned, our implant sales force is already generating leads for imaging and CAD/CAM and planning joint clinical education events to train doctors on the Dentsply Sirona implants line.", "An important part of our clinical education strategy is partnering with dental schools around the globe. In the U.S. Dentsply Sirona products are in virtually all dental and dental hygiene schools. Our Endo business currently partners with 100% of U.S. Endo residency programs. Today, Dentsply Sirona is training the next generation of dentists on products and introducing them to best-in-class solutions. Once they graduate and enter the workforce, they will demand technology and integrated solutions. Dentsply Sirona is the only manufacturer that can meet this growing trend and we will.", "To deliver all of our solutions to the market, we'll continue to invest in our sales and service infrastructure. This quarter we built out our infrastructure in Mexico and continued expanding our presence in China and India. While we will leverage our infrastructure to sell more efficiently, we remain focused on accelerating long-term top-line growth.", "Overall, I am excited to see the Dentsply Sirona team unite and deliver a strong first quarter. As the dental solutions company, Dentsply Sirona will transform the dental market.", "I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for Dentsply Sirona. We are pleased to recognize our distribution partners for helping us achieve our very successful quarter. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our 15,000 employees who work hard each and every day to improve the lives of dentists and their patients. Together, we will change dentistry for the better.", "We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question will come from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you. Can you hear me okay, guys?", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Perfect.", "Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "All right. Great. Congratulations, guys, on a good first quarter here. Jeff, just wanted to start with you and then I have a follow-up for Uli. But I know you've only been in the seat now for a couple months here running the combined companies. But as you put everything together, any sense yet on kind of how you're thinking about the next several years from a top line perspective or maybe from an earnings growth perspective, just how you're seeing the two companies come together?", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "New company, same old questions, right? Look, first of all, it is early days and I have to tell you I'm thrilled with what the team's been able to do together. Frankly, one of the nice surprises is to see how talented we are across the globe in sales, marketing, R&D and certainly our functional areas, HR and finance. It's a big deal when two of the largest companies come together to make sure that you have the right cultural fit.", "But one thing is for sure that we aligned on is really on our mission, Jeff, which is to empower dental professionals to deliver better, safer and faster dental care. And this idea of end-to-end solutions is where we feel the market is going. So a key fundamental to the merger was growth. So we expect to grow faster in the future. And the reason for that is we're better together to be able to accelerate the adoption of technologies and digital dentistry.", "Frankly, when we look at what is possible on the synergy side, as you look at our specialty areas as well as our technology, there's a lot of things that we see early days that are just going to continue to play for us. And, of course, single-visit dentistry is just getting stronger. It's difficult to say if we're at a tipping point yet, but we feel better about that and our ability to work with CAD/CAM and implant, and ortho certainly gives us a strong feel for our ability to mobilize our synergy opportunities. So there's a lot of genuine excitement here. And I think it's truly great for the dental industry and our distributor partners, because we're going to do a lot of great things together.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "All right. Great. And, Uli, maybe my follow-up question. As I look at the EPS guidance over the balance of this year, it looks like it's kind of low-single digits EPS growth. We don't have the pro forma net income, pro forma operating income from last year. But when I mash your two models together and look at kind of the net income, operating income growth this year, it looks like even on a pro forma combined basis this year over last year, it's going to be much higher than that low-single digit. So what am I missing there between the operating income and net income good solid growth and the EPS growth that looks like it's going to come in lower than that over the balance of the year?", "Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "Yes. I think, Jeff, the best way to think about it or to bridge it for you is if we start with Dentsply's stand-alone EPS last year of $2.62, right? And we take the midpoint of our guidance this year, $2.75, so this would be a $0.13 increase, or a 5%, which we will probably refer to as low-single digits, right? Then I told you that we expect FX headwinds of about $0.10, which would add another 4%. And as you know, we've issued Dentsply shares in exchange for Sirona shares. And with the multiple difference we issued, depends on if you look at it trailing or forward-looking, but somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 million, 16 million more shares for the same earnings than had we issued the shares at the same multiple.", "So this gives you a diluted impact for the full-year of somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.15 to $0.17, say $0.16 for argument's sake. So that's another 6%. And if you add this up, you look at EPS growth excluding FX and excluding the difference of the multiples on the issuance of about 15%. And if you use this, I think you can back into our earnings growth from there. Does that answer your question?", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yes. I'll go back and check my math, but that's helpful. Thank you, Uli.", "Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "Thanks. You're welcome.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Tyler Harris - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hey, guys. It's Tyler Harris in for Bob today. It looks like you guys had pretty impressive internal growth rates across the board in the quarter. Can you give us any additional color on specific countries markets growth rates, especially in regards to Europe and Asia Pacific?", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So I think we were across the board strong. No question about it. Rest of the world led the way for us. And of course, in the rest of the world, let's start there, a number of those areas are challenged. Japan, of course, is a very important market for us. But it has its challenges, but we continue to perform well. You'll start to hear a theme here, Tyler. China also had some challenges, but very pleased with what the team was able to accomplish there. And even Brazil, which certainly has its challenges, we were able to do particularly well in the consumables area, which is pleasing for us.", "We expect the rest of the world to be a growth driver for us for the rest of the year. In Europe, we did well. We haven't seen anything really change over the last six months. Frankly, Russia still has some challenges, but I was pleased with how the team was able to perform, especially looking at our pipeline ahead, we have a number of projects there. Southern Europe seems to be picking up for us, albeit it's a low base. Germany performed but did not lead Europe. And then we saw strong growth in both Technologies and Consumables in Europe. But I would caution that our second quarter will be a difficult comp because of IDS last year. And keep in mind that IDS was a record for us.", "In the U.S., again, very strong growth led by Technologies and also up operatory consumables. We feel good about what we're able to accomplish. We also see that the U.S. market is improving and the underlying demand for our products are strong.", "Tyler Harris - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks for the questions. The original view was for the deal to be accretive in year one. Now, Jeff, that you've had a little bit more time, not a ton, but a little bit more time to put the companies together and evaluate, as well as evaluate the synergies a little bit more deeply, can you maybe just give us a better sense of what you're seeing as far as the accretion or what your expectation is as far as the accretion will be in 2016, specifically?", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, specifically, we're not going to get into that. But we'd say we're not backing off of our being accretive over the first 12 months, absolutely. We see such positive ability to grow together. And, of course, we've had a little headwind that Uli has talked about, but by and large, everything is on track or doing better.", "Again, 67 days into this, pleased about how the team has mobilized together. We've certainly got some FX headwinds, and as Uli, I think, did a very nice job earlier talked about the share count headwind as well. But from a standpoint of growth in this market 4% to 6%, we think is leading the way. And we feel good about our prospects for the rest of 2016. And we started our year with a very solid quarter. So I think we're in a good place, Bob.", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Got it. And then I guess just one specific one on the Technology segment. Really nice growth there in the quarter. Was wondering if you could comment on the sales of CAD/CAM specifically? As your channel partner in North America had talked about carrying a higher level of inventory coming into this year, I'm just trying to get a balance between what may be they're holding versus what the end-market's really doing. Any comments around that will be very helpful.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, certainly, Technology led the way at 6.5% for the quarter and certainly was leading the way in the U.S. as well, and that was led by CAD/CAM. And so the proposition has not changed with regard to us believing that along with Patterson that CEREC will become a standard-of-care, and we're on the appropriate trajectory for that. Keep in mind also that we launched the new Zirconia Blocks, but more critical to that was our SpeedFire. So there was a lot of interests ahead of that, and I think that it's a situation where we've got a lot of opportunities for CEREC in North America and we'll continue to. Uli, do you want to comment...", "Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "No, thank you. You mentioned it with the launch of the SpeedFire, I think people geared up to be ready to deliver, right? And we had a really good growth in CAD/CAM. I think there was nothing to be ashamed of, right? Very solid growth.", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "No, I agree. Thanks so much for the comments.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks. You're welcome.", "Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.", "Roberto V. Fatta - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Robbie Fatta in for John today. Thanks for taking the question. As we think about the new segment structure, is there any additional detail you'll be giving going forward on some of the sub-segments? I know we just talked about CAD/CAM a little bit, but imaging or implants or any of the traditional sub-segments that we used to get more detail on, will we be getting any going forward?", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, we'll certainly give you color for how they performed and certainly talk about new products. The idea is we spent a lot of time thinking about how best to structure our organization, how could it be most meaningful for our organization to grow, to create value, to be able to untap both cost and revenue synergies. And so that structure also means that when you look at our overall business that there isn't any business that is really more than 15%. So going down to our smallest, which is instruments. So we're trying to get people focused on Technology and Consumable, but certainly we'll deal with the strategic business units within it. You had mentioned imaging. Imaging had a solid quarter and grew above the technology average. It was across all regions. So it was pretty strong growth.", "Roberto V. Fatta - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Great. And if we could just focus on implants for a second then. Can you give us a sense what the growth was for that in the quarter? And then maybe our sense is that the potential synergies that you could generate is pretty big and the implant group's maybe the biggest out all of them. Is that a fair...", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let's start with that, because I think that is absolutely an on-point comment. We think implant is a strategic fulcrum for us. We see how it relates to both our CAD/CAM and imaging business. We believe we are well positioned with our product offerings there. We think this is a category that will continue to grow. We have certainly a strong product offering there. When you couple that with CEREC, ATLANTIS, SIMPLANT and ISUS, it's a robust offering.", "Rest of the world did better for us there. We were pleased to see the volume come up, pick up a bit for us there. We saw some challenges in Europe, and certainly a market that we're very excited about that we think we can do a lot more in is in the U.S. Chris, you want to make a few more comments?", "Christopher T. Clark - President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies", "Yes. Absolutely. Thanks, Jeff. I think I agree with all of those comments. I think this is one where both parties came with very significant and meaningful assets to come together. If you think about, again, the implant is going digital. Obviously, we have the CEREC, we have all the imaging coming from the Sirona side, we've got the ATLANTIS, SIMPLANT, ISUS coming from the Dentsply side.", "And I would say, I'm very pleased with how these teams have come together, both from a standpoint of longer term or middle term, if you will, as well product synergies. But in addition to that, some nearer-term opportunities in terms of lead sharing, KOL sharing, et cetera, that, again, there's a lot of excitement, a lot of movement and a lot of energy. And, again, as Jeff mentioned, we've got expectations here that this really does accelerate implant growth rate and also, frankly, helps imaging and CAD/CAM over time as well.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. When you just think about the clinical education, the engagement of our KOLs, the possibility of what we're able to do together with our technologies and in implant are pretty substantial.", "Roberto V. Fatta - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Matt Miksic with UBS.", "Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Vik in for Matt. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had a couple over here. So can you help us understand the puts and takes on gross margin? I know you had mentioned FX in your global efficiency programs. Anything in particular on product mix, for example? And then how should we think about gross margin for 2016? And anything in particular we should keep in mind over the next three quarters?", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, let me start and then I'll hand it over to Uli on that. But you need to understand that product mix and regional mix can have a significant impact in any quarter. But now that we talk about our businesses, no business being greater than 15% coming all the way down to 3%, it should take some of that lumpiness out of it. But, nevertheless, in the quarter, it can have the impact of more than 75 basis points, over 100 basis points, depending on the mix. So mix does play a role, no question about it. But the way to start to think about that is how we talk about how the consumables or the technology businesses grew in the quarter. That's the first thing you need to think about. But we're trying to also get you focused on our operating income, which we think is a better lever to understand our businesses. But go ahead.", "Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "Yes. I think, if you look at our margins in Q1, we provided you with the rec tables. I talked a little bit on the prepared remarks on the GAAP versus non-GAAP items. So, I think, what you see on the rec table is the margin a little bit over 60% reported for the first quarter after these adjustments.", "I did mention that the fact that Sirona has a very strong margin. We only consolidated one month of Sirona, pronounced a little bit the benefit of the merger. So that also helped the gross profit margins. They were probably a tad higher in this recording than they would have been on the complete month. I also said this on the remark to operating margins. And the other thing to think about is the exchange rates. We're now at $1.14. The first quarter was a little bit lower. So that will hurt our gross profit margins, especially on the Technology segment, literally almost all of our manufacturing is euros, Swiss franc or Swedish krona based, right? So, for the full year I would expect them to be quite a bit lower than the 60% we saw in Q1. Again, due to FX and due to the fact that we will not always only have the best month of the quarter in the numbers.", "Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. And just one more, if I could. Can you give us a sense of some of the areas that you're monitoring that could potentially put you at either the bottom or the top end of your guidance beyond what you've seen in a very strong first quarter? Thank you.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think the way to think about it is the markets continue to hold up. We continue to see that our early wins on our revenue synergies accelerate faster than we had expected. We certainly have some tough comps ahead of us on Q2 and Q3. So how we are able to execute in those quarters will have a lot to do with the ability to go beyond. But, of course, as we were just talking about, the impact from sales and margin mix will play a big role in that.", "Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we'll move next to Jon Block with Stifel.", "Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great. Thanks, guys, and good morning. Maybe, Jeff, just the first one for you, the balance sheet is, obviously, very strong. You completed the $500 million share repo. I think you're still only in and around one times levered debt-to-EBITDA. So just maybe at a high level, if you can talk about the company's ability to do acquisitions, even small ones, over the next 12 months or so, and I'm asking more from the capabilities around an integration standpoint, obviously, more so than financial.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right. Okay. First of all, let me tell you one of the truly gems of Dentsply Sirona is our business development team. We have exceptionally capable people there that can process and digest a lot. The fact that we've been working at the global efficiency and now have a formalized integration office to deal with this puts us in better stead. We know which countries are the most stable and ones that it might be a little bit longer away to contemplate a M&A position there.", "But by and large, I will tell you that our strategic plan is all about continuing to do acquisitions. It's day 67 and I can tell you we are right up to speed on what the possibilities are to go out there. Of course, when you are in the midst of this type of transformational merger, you do take into consideration your ability to integrate and how quickly we'd be able to do it. So that's all part and parcel for that. But from the standpoint of myself, the management team and the board, we believe we've got a lot of room that can grow through acquisition.", "Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Perfect. Very helpful. And just one more quick one for you, Uli. I don't believe the $2.70 to $2.80, I don't think that assumes much more in the way of share repos done this year. So can you just talk about that a little bit? If you guys go ahead and do incremental share repurchases, should we view that as marginal upsides to the $2.70 to $2.80? Thanks, guys.", "Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "Yes. I think we told you that our guidance is based on a share count range of 220 million to 225 million. And as we leave Q1 and if our share price doesn't change anymore, because this has an impact of the diluted part of the options, we would end up the year about in the middle of what we told you, around 223 million shares. We gave you the range, because we still have an authorization left. We have about $3.6 million left on our buyback authorization. We do intend to execute on this. Timing depends on the availability of our cash flow and our other plans. So it does include the possibility that we buy back a bit more in the course of the year.", "Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks for your time.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Jon.", "Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP", "You're welcome, yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Nice to have the gang back together here. First question is on synergies. Jeff, you reiterated the $125 million by year three that you laid out with Bret in the call last September. It'd be helpful just to hear at a high level how your thinking around the $125 million is evolving and then how you think about the pacing. You mentioned in a prior comment that you see the sales piece of that as a little bit more back-half loaded. Could you comment on the cost piece of that as well?", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. I would say that we've already started on some of the cost. Cost is easier to identify, and you can go at it a little bit quicker. Certain corporate costs we've evaluated and come after insurance audit fees. The other thing is when you're doing country consolidations, there are overlaps with regard to software and duplication in functionality and functions. And, certainly, also from a sourcing perspective, we are at that, there are some quick wins that we've been able to talk about.", "But equally, I think, we've spent a lot of time with our team. And, in a moment, I'm going to have Chris talk to you a little about that, because he's been leading the way with revenue synergies, and we're really pleased to see how well the teams have come together to collaborate. Again, keep in mind it's day 67, but the type of wins that we're talking about that make sense for the dental practitioner, for our distribution partners, for Dentsply Sirona are really coming up.", "From a perspective of the three years, the $125 million. Again, we're not backing away from that. We're very confident about it. But to give more color at this time about what we'll map in as far as year two and year three, I don't think we're \u2013 well, I know we're not going to talk about that today, Steve. But we tried, in my prepared remarks, to really give you a lot of things that we're working on that will have a big impact. Chris?", "Christopher T. Clark - President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies", "Yes. I guess, Steve, I'd characterize it is follows. As I mentioned on the implants discussion that there's a lot of energy here and that's true, frankly, for all of the different work streams that we have going and these are numerous. You should think about the work streams really being both within the two segments and then across the two segments as well.", "You should think about them being focused on product synergies, again, being probably more a little \u2013 think of that a little bit more innovation-based or R&D-based. There are some that are probably intermediate term, some longer-term. But again, those are probably going to be on the tail-end, if you will, or at least the back half of the three-year period. Some may be a little bit before then. And a lot of energy going there, again, when we get our scientists together, when we get our marketers together, and really think about the possibilities in terms of combined solutions.", "On the other hand then, in the nearer term, on the commercial synergies think about, again, our sales and marketers getting together and talking about programmatically what can we do to drive more value with our customers together. And, again, you can think about that in terms of promotions, in terms of how we present ourselves to our customers, in terms of, as I mentioned earlier, KOLs, clinical education, et cetera. And so, again, there's a lot of energy, many, many work streams here. But, again, we're excited about how our people are engaging. And I think that bodes well for the trajectory and where we head, frankly, not just this year but over the three-year period and beyond.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Again, digital dentistry, clinical education, if you just, Steve, think about how many trainings and educations we do where we never had any of our products also in the room when you're doing a training on ortho, implant, endo, where that can play in. And it works both ways. And, certainly, nobody's done better than Dentsply Sirona in clinical education, and that is valued highly by the dental professional.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks for all that color. Just one follow-up, actually, to a comment that you made earlier, Jeff, the language you used was something to the effect of our corporate strategy is all about M&A. I can't say it's a terribly surprising comment, but it would help given that comment and context to hear how you and the rest of the board think about your priorities and commitments around M&A, how do you think about the returns that you would require and what sort of strategic imperatives are you really trying to address there on the street? Thank you.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I mean, look, this is certainly from a standpoint of the bigger picture what we look at. We are first and foremost a innovator, right? And so, technology matters, so we're out there, we're looking at businesses that maybe need a larger company infrastructure. They've got something that they're either just finished with or they need more resources to finish that, that's something that's very important, something both companies have done extremely well.", "And then, we take a look at what can we add to our SBUs? What would be a additional add-on that would help growth or the adoption of the technology or sell more of the consumables certainly. And let's not forget the regional play which is why I said we have to look at each country within the stability level there.", "Certainly, again, we look for the acquisition to be accretive. And if it's not going to be accretive, we've got to be able to explain to you very quickly why this will get there in a fast enough form that is necessary. ROIC has always been something that is significant to us and hasn't changed. I think we have a very robust process internally that we go through.", "Frankly, I wanted to highlight it earlier because I think the team's truly extraordinary. And that was something that I can tell you from a standpoint at Sirona, we were good, Dentsply is great. And so, coming together on that makes a big difference. Also, we've been able to have discussions with our board about that. We recognize that capital allocation is a critical component. We think that we're one of the few companies that can be a true consolidator in this industry. And so, there's a lot of room for that to take place over the years to come.", "And as you know, like anything, you have to be ready to seize the opportunity when it becomes available. And I think that's the point that we want to stress. Yes, we have to integrate. Yes, we understand that priority. And our 15,000 know our first and foremost is to them and to our shareholders and stakeholders to make sure our nucleus is strong but after that, we just see plenty of opportunities. Now, we're going to stay disciplined. That doesn't change. But that's part of our roadmap. And I want to be crystal clear about that.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks so much, guys.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Thanks. I want to go back to one of the questions earlier on CAD/CAM. I understand you guys don't want to give numbers for the quarter. But I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about underlying market growth for that market. You've got a number of dynamics here with the Zirconia workflow and obviously, some of your competitors. So, can you maybe just talk about how you see the growth trajectory for CAD/CAM for the next couple of years?", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Tycho. Nice to hear from you. I mean, look we did give color that CAD/CAM led technology grew faster than the overall technology. And that's because single-visit dentistry is here to stay. You're hearing it more and more. In ortho, it's growing the fastest, I would say, around the globe. But you won't hear from the dental community or distribution a disagreement about chair side becoming the standard of care. We've heard more about digital impression only but that's typically in ortho. And, of course, our Zirconia, it's really a game changer. When you think about this material and the strength of it, and also the aesthetics and how it compares to others, typically, Zirconia has been something that you would only do through the lab and of course, our Cercon ht is a product that we're excited about that will deliver through the lab as well. But from a chair side perspective, you never considered it because it took two hours to sinter. Now, with the SpeedFire, it's 15 minutes.", "Why is this so significant? Because Zirconia is a terrific material for molars and certain bridges and actually very popular amongst dentists. And so, to be able to have this type of ceramic be available at chair side just truly opens up our addressable market. And by addressable market, we're not talking about adding 2,000 or 3,000 more dentists who are interested. We're talking about tens of thousands of dentists that will now take a look at this opportunity where they wouldn't have before. So, we believe that's just another reason why CEREC makes sense.", "But the other thing, frankly, is the fact that, now, everybody is talking about not just restorative, but we're talking about what you can do with CEREC on an implant and ortho side. And I have to say that we were at the AAO and in a second I'm going to ask Chris to tell you about that flavor. But you just see the appetite for digital impression and what the possibilities are for all types of applications. And I think that was a bit of the story at the AAO.", "Christopher T. Clark - President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies", "Absolutely, Jeff. I mean, there's no doubt that a lot of energy regarding digital at the orthodontic show. Obviously, we're there and well positioned with the Omnicam. And, again, I think that as we look at the synergies of these companies coming together, there's no doubt that similar to implants, ortho is really one of the key fulcrums and one of the key opportunities. So, we're excited about that. I think that we're well positioned for where this market is headed. And, again, I think that really, as we move forward, I would expect that to be one of the key synergies.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I mean, it's a beautiful thing that the ortho to be the most open and also to have a clear aligner in our MTM for the anterior, which is exciting for us.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Christopher T. Clark - President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies", "Thanks, Tycho.", "Operator", "And there are no further telephone questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you very much for joining us on our first ever first quarter conference call as Dentsply Sirona. Very excited what we have ahead of us. Our 15,000 strong are ready to go and have another strong quarter in Q2. So, I look forward to joining you in August to discuss our second quarter results. Thank you and have a great weekend.", "Operator", "And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Joshua Zable, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Sir, you may begin.", "Joshua Zable", "Thank you. And good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2016 conference call. I would like to remind you that an earnings slide deck presentation relating to this call is available on our website at www.DentsplySirona.com. Before we begin please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slides 2 and 3 of our earnings slide presentation. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results.", "We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.", "With that, I will now turn the program over to Jeffrey Slovin, Chief Executive Officer of DENTSPLY SIRONA.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Thanks, Josh. It is my pleasure to welcome you all to our second quarter conference call. Also joining us on the call today Uli Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Our second quarter represented our first full quarter as DENTSPLY SIRONA. We're now at day 168 of the merger and after seeing the progress we've made and the talent we have I'm even more optimistic today than I was on day one. Our culture remains a top priority for myself and the management team. We're already seeing the benefits of our focus on this priority. We're designating resources to ensure that our people come together as a high-performance organization.", "During the quarter, we selected culture champions and have begun to hold workshops. Our 15,000 employees are embracing our mission, vision and values which are all aimed at accelerating growth and having a greater impact on the dental community. I am also pleased with the rollout of our new DENTSPLY SIRONA brand. Across the globe our employees are embracing being one global team. From recruiting to trade shows Toronto to Tokyo our employees are welcoming the opportunity to put forward a unified brand. We're on track to hit our synergy target of $125 million by the end of our third year. We're beginning to ramp up investments in these opportunities and are confident that they will deliver strong returns.", "Later on I will share some early success stories. Integration and synergy capture are high priorities but we also remain focused on the business at hand. Turning to the second quarter, constant currency revenue growth of 3.4% was driven by internal growth of 2.4%. Rest of World led with 7.5% internal growth, showing strength in both consumables and Technologies. I am particularly pleased to see the strong performance of our team in challenging geographies such as China and Brazil. Our U.S. business grew 3.8% with 1.2% internal growth driven by consumables. Our Technologies business came off a strong Q1 while we continue to lead in the digital sensor category with our Schick brand. Our second quarter growth was negatively impacted by lower shipments of intraoral sensors.", "In Europe we managed to grow on top of our 9% growth in Q2 last year. We were pleased to maintain the high level of revenues in this region with consumables offsetting declines in Technologies. As a reminder, our equipment business grew strong double digits in Europe last year associated with a record IDF. Turning to our business segments, Dental and Healthcare Consumables delivered constant currency growth of 3.4% and internal growth of 3.8%. Growth was broad-based across all Dental and Healthcare product categories. We're particularly proud of the rebound in our prosthetics business following last year's reorganization. They are energized to take advantage of the opportunities presented to the lab business through the merger.", "Our Technologies segment grew 3.3% constant currency with 1% internal growth. As noted earlier, this follows double-digit growth in the prior year and strong growth in Q1. Regionally growth in rest of the world offset declines in Europe. Adjusted EPS of $0.76 grew 4.1%. Net income growth of 75% offset the impact of additional shares issued in the merger. During the quarter we also delivered on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.", "We bought back in additional 1.6 million shares for $100 million and paid $18 million in dividends. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the flexibility to pursue multiple avenues of value creation. In June we announced the agreement to acquire MIS Implants for $375 million. MIS is a leading value implant manufacturer with a strong brand across the globe. This acquisition represents our entry into the growing $1.5 billion value implant market. MIS will play an important role in many of our dental solution strategies.", "Overall, I am pleased with what we accomplished in a very short period of time, both operationally and strategically. I will now turn the call over to Uli who will review our second quarter financials.", "Uli Michel", "Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. This morning I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. In the second quarter our reported revenue increased $324 million to $1.022 billion, up 46.4% from last year. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses, excluding precious metals, grew 3.4% on a constant currency basis. Internal growth was 2.4% excluding a 1.5% favorable impact from net acquisitions and 50 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products.", "Foreign exchange movements were a headwind, revenue of approximately 70 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if it had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together. U.S. GAAP gross profit was $526.9 million, up $127.2 million or 31.8% from 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 680 basis points to 52.4% from 59.2% in the prior year. As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 780 basis points, mostly due to the effects of step-up amortization and other merchant-related items.", "On an adjusted basis, gross profit margin was 60.2% for the quarter. The Company generated benefits from its global efficiency program which largely offset negative foreign currency impacts. Reported SG&A expense which includes R&D, was $402.1 million, up $127.1 million or 46.2% versus last year. This equates to 40% of sales excluding precious metals, 80 basis points below prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of SIRONA'S lower operating expense rate and savings from the global efficiency program, partially offset by increased amortization expense and other costs related to the merger. Adjusting for these non-GAAP items, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metals, was 37.1% compared to 39% last year. The ratio was largely unaffected by FX.", "Restructuring expenses were $3.6 million, down from $38.9 million last year. In 2015 the Company reorganized portions of its laboratory business and associated manufacturing capabilities within the Dental and Healthcare Consumables segments. In total, GAAP operating income was $121.2 million, up $35.4 million or 41.3% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, up 190 basis points compared to 21.2% last year.", "Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency program and the consolidation of SIRONA. FX had a negative impact of approximately 80 basis points on the rate. Net interest expense for the second quarter was $8.9 million, $200,000 lower than prior year. Other income in the second quarter was $11.5 million, up $11.2 million from prior year. During the quarter, there were significant foreign exchange movements which provided a $13 million tailwind to other income. Approximately $9 million of this amount reflects unrealized gains on intercompany balances caused by currency movements following the Brexit vote at quarter end.", "For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $17.9 million versus $24.8 million last year. The 2016 expense is based on a full-year adjusted operational tax rate of 23%, in line with last year's rate. Due to U.S. GAAP net income attributable to DENTSPLY SIRONA was $105.4 million, up 139% from the prior year. Second quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.44 compared to $0.31 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income grew 74.6% to $180.9 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.76, up 4.1% from last year as net income growth more than offset the impact of additional share issuance related to the merger. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release.", "Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $187.4 million compared to $145.6 million last year. Cash used in investing activities was $18.1 million compared to $14.4 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increases were primarily related to the consolidation with SIRONA. The sum of operating and investing cash flows resulted in free cash flow of $169.3 million compared to $131.3 million last year. As you can see, we used the free cash flow in Q2 to settle repurchases of shares and to pay dividends to our shareholders. We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $311.6 million.", "Now turning to guidance. We reiterate our previous guidance. For fiscal 2016, we still expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following key inputs. Constant currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6% excluding precious metals. This includes a 1% net benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products and internal growth in the range of 3% to 5%.", "At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues including precious metals of about $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. Please keep in mind that we continue to face a challenging comp in Q3 related to last year's record International Dental Show and strong performance in our consumables business. At the current exchange rate, we would expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%.", "Our EPS range implies the full-year share count of 220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares and FX headwinds up to $0.10. Our guidance does not include the impact of MIS or any other prospective acquisitions.", "I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff?", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Thanks, Uli. With our second quarter behind us we have even more confidence that DENTSPLY SIRONA is ideally positioned to benefit from six megatrends in dentistry. First, positive demographics are driving the need for more dental care around the world. With the broadest portfolio of products and the widest geographical coverage, DENTSPLY SIRONA is in an outstanding position to capitalize on this trend. We're actively driving two other megatrends, the adoption of digital dentistry and single visit dentistry. It is broadly agreed in the industry that both of these will become standard of care. While everyone is trying to jump on the digital wave, just offering a product in the category isn't enough. Brand, technology and service are key differentiators.", "As the innovator and market leader, DENTSPLY SIRONA uniquely provides the confidence to dental professionals to go digital. We're committed to keep investing in R&D to maintain and extend our leadership position. Last week we saw another good indication that these trends are accelerating. In Berlin the German Society for Computerized Dentistry opened a digital dental academy. This establishment is the first of its kind in Europe. They chose to partner with DENTSPLY SIRONA for equipment and consumables. This organization will work with leading universities and facilities to privately train on digital workflow. Additionally, we see dental labs increasingly partnering up with dentists to assist them in buying our Omnicam. Digital impression is proving to not only be positive for the dentist and the patient but for the lab, as well.", "Another megatrend is the general practitioners are expanding their practice and performing more specialized procedures. To do so, they require technology as well as training and education. DENTSPLY SIRONA has the broadest clinical education platform in the industry. Each year we train over 300,000 clinicians covering all procedures and treatment categories around the world. We have developed this capability over decades with significant investment resources.", "We also work with dental schools around the globe to ensure adoption of our best-in-class technology. In the U.S., DENTSPLY SIRONA products are in virtually all dental and dental hygiene schools. Our vision to improve oral health around the globe will be driven by the next generation of practitioners who are learning on our products today. During the quarter we announced a collaboration with the NYU College of Dentistry. We're providing a fully equipped endodontic clinical suite. We will employ the most advanced educational and patient care technologies available with equipment and consumables from DENTSPLY SIRONA. This synergy came as a result of the teamwork within our organization and the innovative products we offer.", "Another megatrend is the expansion of group practice. Groups understand the value of efficiency and consistency of care. They are gaining greater appreciation of the competitive advantages associated with single visit dentistry. Therefore, exceptional technology, training and education are critical when selecting manufacturing partners. As DENTSPLY SIRONA, we're best positioned to meet their needs.", "Last but not least, integrated workflows is another megatrend. One key rationale for our merger was the convergence of consumables and technology to address this trend. Next week's SIROWORLD event will provide thousands of dental professionals their first experience with the power of our integrated solutions. With our current product portfolio and commitment to innovation, DENTSPLY SIRONA is the only manufacturer with the ability to offer end-to-end solutions to dental professionals.", "As I promised earlier, let me now share with you some early integration success stories. On the cost side, we're well into the country development process. Where combining organizations in multiple countries to form country and regional teams. This will reduce costs, improve collaboration, cross-selling, leverage customer resources and relationships. We have recently kicked off a major initiative focused on creating a best-in-class support structure. We're currently establishing the appropriate baseline for general and administrative resources for future growth. Building on our past success in procurement we have established a global team that is focused on saving opportunities with vendors on both materials and services. While becoming more efficient is critical to our success, our merger will be defined by our ability to accelerate growth and drive revenue synergies. With the largest sales and service infrastructure in the industry, we're uniquely positioned to deliver on our offering.", "Leveraging 4,000 sales professionals and 5,000 distributors around the world, we're introducing commercial strategies to capture revenue synergies. We have established a project management structure to drive execution. During the quarter communication and teamwork between DENTSPLY SIRONA equipment and consumables specialists resulted in us winning an international hospital vendor. Thanks to their teamwork we offered a much stronger proposition to the hospital. As a result, we ended up selling double the amount of product.", "Another way in which we're driving revenue synergies is through product innovations. During the quarter, we introduced multiple solutions to the marketplace. These products will have impact for years to come. In chairside consumables we're beginning to launch Aquasil Ultra PLU.S., a new best-in-class impression material that makes taking impressions quicker and easier. In endo we're rolling out our new Reciproc glue, next-generation endodontic file to do root canals faster and safer.", "In ortho we launched our new Omni PLU.S. and BioForce PLU.S. brackets and wires. We're in the very early stages of transforming this business. These new products along with others will help us grow and gain market share. One of the unique opportunities for DENTSPLY SIRONA is the collaboration and development of new fully integrated solutions. As you know, earlier this year we launched our zirconia package with both equipment and consumables. CEREC zirconia package is driving robust demand for both equipment and consumables.", "We continue to expand our materials offering. The ability to do zirconia chairside is opening up new customer base and creating additional interest in CEREC. The large community of zirconia users can now offer single visit dentistry to their patients. Overall, I am pleased with our accomplishments to date. We're all looking forward to SIROWORLD next week. This will be our first major event as DENTSPLY SIRONA. The team is very excited to interact with dental professionals and demonstrate why DENTSPLY SIRONA is The Dental Solutions Company. I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for DENTSPLY SIRONA. We're pleased to recognize our distributing partners for their loyal support.", "I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our employees who daily show their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients. Together we will change dentistry for the better.", "We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from John Kreger with William Blair.", "John Kreger", "Jeff, can you maybe just address what you see in terms of any changes in the markets, particularly given what Schein said yesterday about the U.S. tailing off in the last few months? Thanks.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Certainly. Well, of course, you know Schein is a very important customer to us and we take their insights seriously. I have to tell you I'm pleased with the growth in our quarter in both of our segments. Certainly to see consumables lead the way in the U.S. showed solid growth. Saw some really nice rebound from our lab business and ortho there. We would say that the market is stable and we continue to be optimistic about it as we progress through the summer.", "Keep in mind that there is ebbs and flows in the summer and there can be some spottiness with that. We're excited about the demand we see for our CEREC world event next week which seemed to pick up the attendance in June and July, so we think that's positive.", "Certainly we're announcing a number of new products which I think is always critical to driving growth. So can't really comment on seeing too much softness, but certainly in parts of the business we can understand why that could be said.", "John Kreger", "Thanks, Jeff and maybe just one quick follow-up. I know it's early days but can you talk about where you are seeing the greatest traction initially in your revenue cross-selling efforts? Curious if you're seeing more pull-through on the consumables side or on the technology side? Thanks.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "It's a great question and something we're working at across the globe. Keep in mind that we've set our organization up in five regions, so each one is distinct. And, of course, there are opportunities across -- we found that there is some real opportunities on both the consumable and the technology sides through the cross promotions and sharing of leads and cross KOLs.", "The fact of the matter is that the world is going digital and there is a clear connection between our endo business and 3D and intraoral which is playing out well for us. Also with regard to implant we're seeing some nice bundling opportunities with our 3D there and also on custom abutment. But I would say that we're looking to show balance throughout. What you have to keep in mind is that we've got over 100 initiatives that we're working through. And it's still early days and I would say that you will still see the 80/20 rule that 20% of our programs will drive it but it's too early to say. I'm very impressed with the collaboration and the creativity of our teams on the commercial and SBU side to work together at this stage.", "Operator", "The next question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.", "Robert Jones", "Just to push a little bit more, Jeff, on the internal growth in the U.S., obviously a noticeable slowdown from recent trend. If I think about your portfolio you have products that go through distribution through distributors and obviously as well as products that go direct. When you look at your sales data for 2Q did you see any difference in the sellout rates for products that went through distribution versus direct?", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Well, look, I think that we certainly came off a good first quarter and specialty did grow a little bit faster which is our direct business than through distribution. But not extraordinarily faster, but we're pleased with what we saw with lab. You've got to remember that lab has been a drag on our business and I want to commend our team for really dealing with the restructuring and getting back to business. And another business of ours that has been going through a longer term restructuring is our ortho and it showed solid numbers and, of course, we can always count on our endo business to do well. But by and large, I thought it was a solid quarter for consumables and Chris, any comments from your side?", "Chris Clark", "No, I think you hit it. I think that clearly ortho, specialties did nicely in the U.S. in the quarter. Consumables did well. We had some pretty strong first quarter on some of the technology side as well as in some cases a tough comp. So, again, I think you've hit pretty much the relevant players.", "Robert Jones", "And then I guess just a quick follow-up on the operating margin. Pretty strong performance in the quarter, trending now above that 22% for the year. Yet I noticed you maintained the 21% to 22% for the year. Just wanted to see if there was any factors that we should be thinking about that might make the back half from an operating margin standpoint regress a bit to get back into that 21% to 22% range? Thanks.", "Uli Michel", "Yes, maybe that's a question I can address. Look, we were very pleased with the margins in Q3. We sold a pretty good mix of product. We've not redeployed some of the investments we had intended to make from the global efficiency savings and some of the early costs we saw coming out as a synergy. So we will invest a bit more in the second half of the year. Then if you look at the seasonality of our business, Q2 is traditionally probably the highest quarter in the year. So we have higher revenues, a lot of our costs are fixed and do not fluctuate that much with revenue. So that gives us a bit of a lift in the second quarter.", "Every year you will see a bit of a downturn in the third quarter from this. And in the balance of these two factors we guided to the EPS number we did. And we based on margins that should be somewhere between 21% and 22% for the full year.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Keep in mind, Bob, that mix plays a critical role for us. And as we look to the rest of the year we wanted to be prudent how we thought about our range.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.", "Jeff Johnson", "So Jeff, maybe a question, coming out of yesterday's call from Henry Schein the other thing I think other than the U.S. market that came up is Europe actually sounded a little better for them. I know you had tough comps but maybe you could walk us through your view on just general end market conditions in Europe.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "So I think Europe fundamentally has not changed since our last call except for something called Brexit which certainly adds another level of uncertainty. We had some early benefits that really highlighted a bit from it, but that would be a change. What I would tell you is that Europe did well for us in general from a perspective that Germany was a drag. We could not expect with the extraordinary year we had last year which was truly a record, that we could grow on that.", "I wouldn't say we lost any market share there. And as I look -- if you take Germany out of Northern Europe, it was rather solid for us. And certainly as we look at Southern Europe very solid and feel good about what we saw growth in France, Italy, Spain, a positive quarter for us in Europe.", "Jeff Johnson", "And Uli, maybe just a modeling question for you. EPS guidance in the back half of the year seems to imply basically flat. I know you said a $0.10 headwind from currency. I think that currency headwind has gone up. Can you just confirm that, number one? And number two, even if we adjust that out I guess trying to figure out after two solid quarters here of EPS beats just what maybe drives a slowing of EPS growth in the back half of the year. Thank you.", "Uli Michel", "Maybe we will start with the FX impact. When we last spoke to you we said that the guidance implies about a $0.10 headwind in FX. We've had for the full year we've had a $0.04 headwind in Q1. We've now had an all-in $0.01 headwind in Q2. But that includes this one-time impact from the Brexit moves. What happened is that we supply out of Europe into South America, Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, many of these countries products and we have receivables on our euro books in Brazilian real, in Japanese yen, in Australian dollars, South African rand, you name it. And all these currencies suddenly strengthened to the euro when the Brexit vote happened. And we realized about, we didn't realize, we record about a $9 million gain on these in the Company receivables. Now who knows whether these will stay or whether the exchange rates will move back. Guidance does not give everything else being equal full credit to this gain.", "Now if I look what is happened since quarter end we probably lost somewhere between $0.005 to $0.01 again on these gains by currency movements. If they stay that is a positive. Now when we give guidance we weigh all the pros and cons very carefully and we try to give you the best estimate and a balanced judgment of what we see. And there is upsides and downsides and sometimes we end up being too optimistic, sometimes too conservative. Maybe on the FX point we've taken a bit of a conservative view. But on the other hand, our guidance does not include a deterioration of end markets in the second half of the year. And you know, you've heard one of our biggest customers yesterday expressed more concerns.", "We looked at it, as Jeff mentioned we saw the spottiness and softness in parts of the U.S. consumable markets going into the summer, as well. But when we look at the big picture, the macroeconomics for North America, very strong. Job creation is good, especially white-collar jobs. So we sat here and we said look, fundamentally we do not really see why there should be a major deterioration. So we did not include this in our guidance and in the forecasts we had prepared. So if we weigh all this we do think it is a realistic and weighted guidance that we gave you.", "There's a range. You can apply judgment yourself, if you believe based on the factors we explained to maybe we might end up rather on the upper end or on the lower part. But we try to be transparent with it and we apply our best judgment we can based on all the facts and circumstances we see and we know. And it was a lengthy answer. But I hope it helps you think through the things, Jeff.", "Operator", "The next question is from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw", "I might take the same tack that Jeff took and ask for some reflections on the puts and takes on the balance of the year. I ask the question because here with a 4% to 6% organic growth outlook it implies a pretty big range of possibilities in organic for the back half of the year. It seems like consensus might be in the lower half of the range. Can you give us a sense, given that it sounds like Jeff you're pretty comfortable with where the markets are trending, what you're looking at as the bigger puts and takes in terms of organic for the balance of the year?", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Look, right now the UK which is about 5% of our business is flat, but I think nobody knows exactly where that's going to go. The aspect of the real uncertainty in the overall macro market it's still out there. Russia has not improved. While we're pleased about what we're able to do in Brazil and China, those markets are challenged. The Middle East continues to have some difficulties. So we have to put that in the overall perspective. We heard from Schein yesterday what they are viewing. We can't discount it, although we don't see it but we see it a little bit spotty way.", "And then we talk about the bigger issues which is the macro trends and the megatrends which we talked about earlier in the call which are all working our way and plus and the ability for our team to come together which I think is very positive with what I'm seeing. And you can't emphasize enough how good it is to recognize some of our businesses that have taken a little bit of time to get back like lab and ortho starting to progress. Remember we set Rest of World would be our driver of growth this year but as we go into the third quarter, remember that's a pretty tough comp record. IDS and CEREC 30 was strong. So we've got to keep that all in our consideration.", "And I think that's my perspective of pulling out some of the stuff that Uli was saying and that's built into our range. We will certainly, are we optimistic that next week's SIROWORLD will be -- sorry, Steve -- will be a very positive event for our organization? Absolutely. ", "But we've got to move through this summer and see how we finish up. And we've decided it's appropriate to keep the range that we have given all of those issues. But we don't see a fundamental change in our business proposition that we have. In fact, we would say that we're seeing more and more indications that being The Dental Solutions Company and being able to offer these integrated end-to-end solutions is exactly what the dental profession is looking for.", "Steve Beuchaw", "I wonder if you could reflect for just a minute in a little bit more detail on the thinking around the MIS Implants transaction. When you look at your customer base, Jeff, now that you have a premium implant brand, what do you think the percentages of doctors out there that are using a value and an implant brand simultaneously? How do you size up that opportunity and are there any regions where you think having a value offering can make you stronger, materially stronger as a Company in terms of your commercial reach?", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Good. In a moment I'm going to let Chris comment as well because he's worked so hard with the team on this acquisition. But let me just tell you MIS is an organization that both companies were looking at prior to the merger. Actually saw a management team that would fit the culture, an innovation cycle that we had thought and has the ability to lead the way in the value segment. So very exciting opportunity for us specifically to get into the value segment which we know is growing faster than other segments in dental. And a $1.5 billion market size is something that's significant when you're talking about a market that's maybe $25 billion overall in dental in the space that we play in.", "I think when you cobble that together with the installed base of customers we have, there's a lot of room. We do see a trend that more and more dentists are having a dual brand strategy to meeting their implant needs. And from a perspective of making a decision in this category, we thought MIS had the best brand that cut across multiple regions and countries. Most value brands are country specific. MIS is unusual to that and is an exciting product to add to our portfolio. Chris, let me hand it over to you.", "Chris Clark", "Steve, I would basically just emphasize a few of these key points. Again, there aren't too many $1.5 billion segments in dentistry we're not in. That's certainly very attractive. Certainly the value segment has been growing faster in this market than the premium segment. There is some overlap of customers, but there is also we view this as a distinct segment in a lot of ways.", "And with that we think a separate go-to-market approach is going to be very effective for us here. We view this as a key opportunity in emerging markets. They've got a very strong presence in a number of these and we're very excited about that. And again as Jeff mentioned, they've got a pretty similar culture. We're impressed with the management team, we're impressed with their ability to drive success both within Israel but outside of their home market, as well. And, again, I think this will be an important part of our implant strategy moving forward as we look to drive market leadership.", "Operator", "The next question is from Matt Miksic with UBS.", "Vik Chopra", "This s Vik Chopra in for Matt. Just a couple of questions over here. So with the recent MIS deal that you guys announced, can you help us understand how you think about future M&A at this point? Are you still open to additional tuck-ins?", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Absolutely, we're. We've said that as part of our overall strategy. Again, we always have to balance the major integration that we're in right now, continuing to drive our current business and the possibilities for the future. But continuing to consolidate and have tuck-ins is a very important part of our strategy moving forward.", "Vik Chopra", "Just one follow-up if I could. Just in terms of where you are looking at, is it technology specific or geographically-based? And then how should we think about synergies at all on the MIS deal? Thank you.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Look, being the largest player with the widest portfolio and actually coming together as technology and consumables, I'd have to say we look at just about everything. But there's a lot of criteria that has to fit. And I don't think we need to get into that on this call. But I would say that the MIS was a really important acquisition for us because we believe with the value proposition that we have in the geographic reach and when we take a look at our customers, this is an area that we just didn't play in. And as both Chris and I have said to not play in a $1.5 billion market that has a faster growing profile than most of the others is just something that we felt was inappropriate for our organization and felt that we needed to do it. And I'm excited we've been able to do that.", "Operator", "The next question is from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse.", "Robert Willoughby", "Jeff, did you comment on any residual capacity constraint issues around the zirconia line? And then a real hard-hitting one, do you have an accounts payable balance for us at the end of the quarter?", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Look, we did have some constraints in the quarter on our zirconia package, if you will. And certainly it's always the case when we're ramping up a new product. Unfortunately, we're not making hundreds of thousands of these. So the ramp-up to get the quality in place does take quarters to do that, but I'm happy to say that the team's worked hard and we're open for business and orders. With regard to payables, Uli is tracking that number down for you.", "Uli Michel", "$227.1 million.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jon Block with Stifel.", "Jon Block", "Maybe just a couple of cleanups or follow-ups. So Jeff, on the value implant market you've called out $1.5 billion. Is the overall $3.5 billion to $4 billion? And then sort of how do you see the growth rates of those two markets? And then Uli, I don't think you've talked about timing and the close and maybe the level of accretion from the MIS deal in the first 12 months. And then I just have a quick follow-up. Thanks, guys.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Chris, do you want to take the first bite and I will take the second?", "Chris Clark", "You bet. Jon, relative to the relative market sizes I think that $3.5 billion to $4 billion overall is probably pretty close when you combine premium and value together . It also includes additional products in there, for instance regenerative products, etc., that we would view the overall global implant market in retail in that $3.5 billion to $4 billion range. ", "Relative to relative growth sizes, again if you look over a longer time period value implants generally are growing in the mid to high single-digit range, probably skewing over a longer period of time in the high single-digit range. And as you look at premium implants, they would be in the low to mid single-digit range. So again, from that angle you will look at it. Quarter to quarter or year to year it may fluctuate slightly, but over a longer period of time that's probably pretty typical.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Jon, my follow-up would be that we fully expect MIS to grow in the high single digits and then surprise in quarters growing even more than that with the product offering we have. We certainly did not pay a cheap price for this. So we have high expectations and we believe that it's the brand and our overall ecosystem will be able to support that growth.", "Uli Michel", "It comes to timing. There's two approvals still outstanding as conditions to closing we're waiting for. We do anticipate that this should still happen this year. On the first 12 months, the acquisition will be accretive to adjusted earnings per share, but the few months we might get into this year probably doesn't swing the needle much.", "Jon Block", "Then just as a follow-up, Jeff, yesterday's news at Schein was I think surprising to most. So maybe your thoughts or any color you can give on the distributor ordering patterns so far in the third quarter in North America? Again, they talk to the slowdown in June that largely persisted into July. So have you seen any change in the cadence of distributor ordering patterns so far in the first six weeks of the quarter? Thanks, guys.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Look, I think we've got to keep in mind that we're talking about a market that's right now in the GDP plus or minus on it which means you can have some fluctuations in a month and it's difficult to tell whether that has started a pattern. We certainly don't have the same visibility that Schein does on this but it's not been an unusual summer for us. But I would also say we did highlight when we gave guidance and we're reinforcing it today that Rest of World is the fastest growing area for us and our biggest driver.", "Operator", "The next question is from Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Matt in for Matt today. Thank you for taking the questions. Can you talk a little bit about the impact DSOs are having on your business and are they executing on chairside opportunity? Thank you.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Group practices are certainly having an impact in our business. I think that's why we highlighted it as one of the six megatrends. Now you're talking to the CEO, Matt, here and I would tell you that we're never happy about doing enough in the group practice area. We do believe that they appreciate everything that DENTSPLY SIRONA has to bring to the group practice to their individual operatories.", "I think our 360 program has been extraordinary. The ability to educate and train is something that we've differentiated ourselves. We've got world-class brands and we're able to help them with the procedures. Certainly I would see more and more that group practices appreciate the impact that digital dentistry and single visit dentistry has on their practice. It's our belief you are going to see more of that in the quarters and years to come.", "Chris Clark", "Matt, it's Chris. I might also add that as the synergy teams come together focusing on the revenue synergy opportunities, one of the areas that they are particularly focused on and excited about with a tremendous amount of energy is, in fact, DSOs and group practices. They see the unique opportunity of the combination here driving unique value to this customer group. And, again, it's exciting to see their excitement. So I think you will hear more and more from us in this area as we move forward.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "And I think, just to add to that, this is becoming more than a North America phenomenon. Chris is really highlighting what we're seeing around the globe.", "Operator", "The next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.", "Sachin Kulkarni", "It's Sachin in for Brandon. Uli, would you quantify the expected CapEx outlays in 2016 and what type of free cash flow conversion do you expect to realize for the year?", "Uli Michel", "Yes, the CapEx number we would expect in the range of $110 million to $125 million for the year. And CapEx conversion as we said before should clearly be above net income. We should convert more than 100% of our net income to free cash flow.", "Sachin Kulkarni", "Jeff, would you provide some color on the Rest of World markets? This geography has been growing in line to above your composite average for some time. So just curious if that's puts and takes driving that performance and the potential runway remaining?", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Sure. I think Australia continues to be strong for us in the quarter. Canada is in Rest of World for us, so real positive driver. Pretty pleased to see Latin America, including Brazil, hold up and grow solidly. And then China. With all the talks about what's going on in China, I would say that we've put together very solid growth and the reality is that 7.5% is significant.", "Uli Michel", "We can probably say Middle East is a bit more challenged. We can say Jeff--", "Jeffrey Slovin", "I said it earlier, yes, that's right.", "Uli Michel", "We do see this in our business.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "I think on the long term, a critical market for us and we're all excited about is Japan. Japan showed some slowness in the quarter, multiple reasons for that. I think we're on track. Feel good about the team we have there and the product offering, but Japan has got to be a long term driver for us. So we would have done better had we gotten more there. But understand what's going on there, as well.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Leckow, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional remarks.", "Derek Leckow", "Thank you all very much for your interest in DENTSPLY SIRONA. We're looking forward to updating you on our next call in November and if you have further questions we're available for follow-ups. Enjoy the rest of the summer. That concludes our conference call. Goodbye.", "Jeffrey Slovin", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

LLC", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC", "Operator", "Good day and welcome to the Dentsply Sirona First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 conference call. I would like to remind you that an earnings slide deck presentation relating to this call is available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com.", "Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slides two and three of our earnings slide presentation. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about the future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.", "And with that, I'll now turn the program over to Jeffrey Slovin, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona. Jeff?", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Thanks, Derek. It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our first quarter 2017 conference call. Also joining us on the call today Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies; and Joshua Zable, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Before I begin, please note that our CFO, Uli Michel, will not be on the call today to attend to a medical issue. We look forward to his return next time.", "Turning to the call, our results this quarter were far from stellar, but I am pleased that we are able to deliver on critical strategic objectives. We are now better positioned to accelerate our short and long-term growth. In March, at the International Dental Show, Dentsply Sirona set the standard for what it means to be a total solutions provider for the dental professionals and labs.", "We unveiled how an enabling technologies integrated with procedural solutions provide better clinical outcomes. We also reinforced our position as the innovator in the industry. At the Show, we launched 50 new products which will drive our growth for years to come. This morning we also announced our plans to expand distribution in the U.S. market. We are excited to expand our partnership with Patterson, with a new long-term U.S. distribution agreement that will help drive adoption of our digital technologies and solutions for years to come.", "Together, over 20 years, we've created CEREC as the standard for single-visit dentistry in the U.S. We are also excited to expand our relationship with Henry Schein in North America, with a new three-year agreement beginning in September, under which Henry Schein will begin selling our leading equipment brand in the U.S. This should benefit all of our product lines, including Schick Sensors, Treatment Centers, extraoral imaging, and of course, CEREC as well.", "Both Patterson and Henry Schein will be critical drivers in accelerating adoption of our digital technology and our unique integrated solutions. We firmly believe our now new go-to-market strategy in the U.S. will accelerate our growth for years to come. I will discuss this in more detail later. Our merger-related initiatives are on track. We will ramp cost and revenue synergy activities throughout the year, driving top and bottom-line growth for 2017.", "Turning to the quarterly results. First quarter internal sales declined 4.7%, driven by decline in technology. Consumables and Healthcare grew 2.4% this quarter. Our Consumables business grew in each of our three regions. Technologies declined by approximately 13% or $57 million. Growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately $40 million as a result of quarter-over-quarter changes in net equipment inventory levels at certain distributors in North America and Europe, related to the transition in distribution strategy in North America. The remaining decline is attributable to weaker retail performance. The largest contributor being the U.S., where the transition to our go-to-market is having an impact.", "Turning to geographies. This quarter Europe led the way with 2.2% internal growth. Consumables growth offset, no growth in Technologies. Revenue synergies are creating momentum for us in Europe. Based on our assessment, our Consumables outpaced the market for the second quarter in a row. Technologies in Europe was essentially flat. We were able to compensate for the unfavorable impact of a $5 million change in net equipment inventory and the slowdown ahead of the International Dental Show.", "As a reminder, in Europe and in Germany in particular, many of our customers wait for the Show to purchase new equipment. We are pleased to report that we had a record order intake at the event. Our success at the Show across both Technologies and Consumables highlighted the power of our merger. Rest of World was down 5.2% on top of last year's 7.5% growth. $5 million or 220 basis points of the decline in Q1 was driven by a change in net equipment inventory level at a distributor in Kennedy associated with the transition of our distribution strategy in North America.", "The remainder of the decline was driven by the Technologies segment, where we had very strong growth in certain countries last year. In Q4 2016, the region grew almost 10%, driven by Technologies. We continue to expect the Rest of World region to be our fastest growing region this year. U.S. sales were down 11% driven by decline in Technologies, as I already discussed, the primary driver of the decline was due to equipment inventory changes and to a lesser extent distributor retail performance.", "Our North American Consumables business grew low single digits. We were pleased to see the business accelerate sequentially from the fourth quarter. We continue to believe that North America market is stable and showing modest improvement. During the quarter, we continue to do our active capital allocation program; we bought back another $85 million of stock and announced a small, but strategically important acquisition, using our strong and flexible balance sheet will continue to be a lever for us to increase shareholder value.", "I'll now turn the call over to Josh who will review our fourth quarter financials and outlook.", "Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. In the first quarter, our reported revenue increased $127.9 million to $900.5 million, up 16.6%. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses excluding precious metals, declined 2.2% on a constant currency basis. Internal growth declined 4.7% excluding a 250 basis point favorable impact from net acquisitions.", "As Jeff already explained, overall sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately $40 million or 430 basis points as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels at distributors related to our transition and distribution strategy in North America.", "Foreign exchange movements were a headwind of revenue of 130 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if the merger had been completed on January 1, 2016. Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segments. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together.", "U.S. GAAP gross profit was $492 million, up $73.1 million or 17.5% from $418.9 million in 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of sales excluding precious metal content, decreased by 20 basis points to 55.3% from 55.5% in the prior year. As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 360 basis points, mostly due to the effects of step up amortization and other merger-related items as compared to 510 basis points last year.", "On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 58.9%, down 170 basis points for the quarter. The majority of the decline is associated with a lower gross profit rate on equipment associated with the timing of the merger. Last year's gross margin was favorably impacted by the consolidation of only the strongest sales month for the quarter for Sirona, with a more favorable product mix. Reported SG&A expense, which includes R&D, was $404.7 million, up $62.6 million or 18.3% versus last year. This equates to 45.5% of sales, excluding precious metals, 20 basis points above prior year.", "Reductions in business combination related costs, fair value adjustments as well as amortization of purchased intangible assets and similar items benefited the rate by 330 basis points. These benefits largely compensated for rate increases driven by the lack of revenues associated with equipment inventory reductions, biennial trade shows and other selling events as well as the effects of acquisitions and foreign exchange.", "Adjusted for non-GAAP items, including amortization expense and other costs related to the merger, SG&A expense was $377.3 million or 42.3% of sales excluding precious metals, representing an increase of 390 basis points. This year, IDS and selling events added approximately 135 basis points and lower sales from dealer inventory reduction also impacted the rate by approximately 180 basis points. FX and acquisitions cost us about 50 basis points. The rest of the increase is the balance of investments in selling and R&D, offsetting savings in G&A.", "Restructuring expenses were $3.1 million, down from $4.1 million last year. In total, GAAP operating income was $84.2 million, up $11.5 million or 15.8% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 16.6%, down 560 basis points compared to 22.2% last year.", "As discussed, the gross profit margin rate was down 170 basis points with favorable impacts from the timing of the merger last year and unfavorable impacts of from equipment distributor inventory reductions this year. In addition to this headwind, operating margins for the current year were impacted by higher operating expense rates by 390 basis points as discussed a moment ago. Net interest and other income and expense for the first quarter increased by $2.3 million compared to the prior year.", "For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $16.9 million versus a $57.9 million benefit last year. As a reminder, last year's first quarter taxes benefited from a $76.1 million valuation allowance release related to the merger. This year we have $6.3 million of discrete excess tax benefits related to employee share-based compensation. Per our existing policy, we exclude discrete tax items from adjusted earnings.", "On an annual basis, we now estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 19.2% compared to 23% in the first quarter last year and 20.8% for the full year 2016. Our lower tax rate is a benefit resulting from the complementary tax attributes of the merged companies.", "Q1 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona was $59.8 million, down 52.1% from the prior year. First quarter diluted GAAP EPS was $0.26 compared to $0.70 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income declined 7.1% to $113.7 million. The decline in net income reflects the lack of revenue largely associated with changes in net equipment inventory levels at certain distributors.", "Adjusted earnings per share was $0.49 compared to $0.69 last year. The $0.20 decline in adjusted EPS was driven by the effects of the higher share count, partially offset by additional two months of Sirona and the effects of the distributor equipment inventory changes. In addition, FX created a $0.03 headwind. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release.", "The year-over-year comparisons in the cash flow statement are less meaningful this quarter, given the timing of the closing of the merger in February last year. I will discuss elements of the cash flow statement this year highlighting the key drivers. Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $82.5 million. Cash used in investing activities is $41.1 million. Capital expenditures were $31.1 million for the quarter. We continue to expect CapEx for the year to be in the range of $120 million to $140 million. During the quarter, we paid $78 million for share repurchases and paid $18 million in dividends.", "Now turning to guidance. For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.80 to $2.90. Our guidance includes the following assumptions: Constant currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%. This includes approximately 150 basis points of net benefit from acquisitions' divestitures, implying internal growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues, excluding precious metals, of $3.95 billion to $4.03 billion. We now expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be 19.2%.", "Our EPS range implies a full year diluted share count of approximately 231 million to 233 million shares versus 222 million in 2016. This reflects approximately $0.09 of headwind at the midpoint and is simply a function of the timing of the merger. We still anticipate FX headwinds of $0.08 to $0.10 for 2017. As we explained on our last call, we will continue to experience headwinds associated with inventory reductions. For now, the inventory reductions are expected to continue to negatively impact our net sales into the third quarter of 2017 by approximately $50 million to $60 million in total.", "As other market channels are brought online in the third and fourth quarter, sales through these channels could offset the majority of the mentioned inventory reduction resulting in a net of $10 million to $20 million unfavorable impact on our revenues for the remainder of the year. We expect this to translate into a much stronger back half of the year. As always, I suggest our investors evaluate our business on an annual basis as our quarterly progression can vary.", "I will now turn the call back to Jeff.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Thanks, Josh. As the dental market grows, Dentsply Sirona will truly be the partner of choice to deliver better, safer, faster dental care to meet the growing demand. Dentistry's importance is being recognized as a critical driver of overall health. In the past quarter alone, multiple studies have confirmed the importance of oral health. At the American Stroke Association's international conference, research was presented linking periodontal disease as a potential cause for stroke. A large study in Japan found that patients who retain more of their natural teeth were less likely to develop dementia.", "In March, the Journal of The American Medical Association published an article highlighting data that showed that poor oral health can trigger autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. In both developed and developing markets, a heightened awareness about the importance of dental care is driving increased demand. Coupled with sustainable demographic trends, our industry has a long runway of growth ahead.", "A significant part of our market is private pay as other health care providers brace for health care reform, our customers can focus on how to best serve their patients. At the IDS, it was clear that dental professionals want to treat their patients with best-in-class integrated solutions. Dentsply Sirona can best support the individual practitioners and group practices, with efficient and effective end-to-end workflows.", "As many of you know, group practices are the fastest-growing segment of the market, and an area where Dentsply Sirona is significantly underpenetrated, particularly in terms of equipment. One of the rationales per the merger was that by coming together, we could offer groups an unmatched value proposition. With the broadest clinical education platform, end-to-end solutions that create more efficient practices and technologies that greatly enhance the patient experience, Dentsply Sirona is an ideal manufacturer partner for the groups.", "In Q1, we expanded our relationship with Aspen Dental, which has 600 practices across 36 states. Clinicians in Aspen branded practices made the decision to implement our new Nupro Freedom Cordless Prophy hand piece throughout their offices. They were one of the first groups to embrace the advantages of the product, which includes one-of-a-kind infection prevention, reduced noise and exceptional ergonomics for hygienists.", "We have a solid foundation with group practices, but we have a significant opportunity to bring more value to current customers and to bring on new ones. We will continue to focus more resources there and develop products that can better support our customers and differentiate us from the competition. This fact was evident at the International Dental Show in March. We launched 50 new products and solutions at the Show itself. At the Show, we unveiled our new root to crown solution. As the market leader in imaging and doing restorative products, Dentsply Sirona can now provide an end-to-end integrated solution for root canals. This makes treatment better, safer and faster. Dental professionals understand that enabling technologies are the key to providing integrated procedural solutions.", "At the IDS, it was clear that digital dentistry is happening today and Dentsply Sirona is best positioned to accelerate the benefits for this megatrend. 3D imaging and single-visit dentistry are both at the tipping point. With the launch of our low-dose mode for the Orthophos SL, we are another step closer to making 3D imaging a standard of care. With lower radiation levels, we've made using our 3D imaging safer, while still offering best-in-class X-ray quality.", "For the first time at the IDS, we announced opening up CEREC systems to enable export of our STL files. Without compromising the integrity of our unmatched Chairside system, opening up the Omnicam will accelerate adoption of our product for digital impressions. Many digital labs have gone from being opponents to digital to supporters. Digital impressions makes labs workflows more accurate and efficient helps them better serve their customers. By opening up the system, we have facilitated better coordination between dental labs and individual practitioners.", "Now as dentists go from impression materials to digital, our Omnicam represents the best choice in terms of quality, ease-of-use and effectiveness for both dentists and labs alike and we still have the number one selling impression material. Awareness and acceptance is not only rising in professional community, but among consumers as well. Single-visit dentistry is differentiating dentists to their patients who are beginning to ask for CEREC by name.", "In May, we launched a direct-to-consumer promotional campaign in conjunction with 1-800-Dentist to celebrate Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales to raise the profile of our technology and educate potential U.S. patients on the benefits of CEREC and single-visit dentistry. We also ramped up our efforts to reach different demographics by appearing on well-known stations such as MSNBC, CNN and ESPN.", "The other critical component to accelerating adoption is the partnership of our distributors. This morning we announced a new go-to-market strategy in the U.S. The U.S. market is the largest in the world and critical to our long-term success. In September, Patterson and Henry Schein, the two largest distributors in the country, will have access to our full distribution product line.", "Our consumables have been part of both Henry Schein and Patterson since the early days of dental distribution in the U.S. We have a unique and important relationship with Patterson, who has been an exclusive partner selling equipment and technology in the United States. Together we have been a driving force in the adoption of digital technologies and our new agreement ensures that our companies continue driving penetration of digital technologies and solutions in this important market.", "We're also excited to expand our relationship with Henry Schein and are confident that adding our equipment lines to their sales and service infrastructure should be complementary, as they already know us and our products well. Schein can leverage the knowledge and success they've had selling our technology in Europe. With both distributors carrying our full distributed product line, we will expand our reach into the U. S. market. Awareness about the digital and single-visit dentistry will increase and expand the market.", "With CEREC only 17% penetrated and 3D even less, there is significant room for growth with both Patterson and Henry Schein. Equally important with both Patterson and Henry Schein, carrying our full distributed product lines, we will be able to reach the majority of U.S. dental professionals with our end-to-end solutions. As they adopt our full solutions, we will grow faster. As our installed base increases, we will have even more opportunities to cross-sell our product portfolio.", "A critical component to cross-selling is also integrating our products. Our leading Treatment Centers are now integrated with our endodontic and implantology systems, further differentiating our products. Dentsply Sirona Treatment Centers are truly the centerpiece of the dental office and critical hubs in our ecosystem. We had another record quarter before the IDS in Q1.", "We also continue to have success selling our Celtra Duo Blocks and other CEREC consumables to new users of our technology. This is rapidly growing multi-hundred million dollar market. This synergy opportunity is significant. We are ramping sales rapidly. As our one global team works hand-in-hand, we are seeing clear benefits. Where our commercial strategies are critical to driving growth, innovation will remain the hallmark of Dentsply Sirona.", "At the American Association of Endodontic's annual meeting, we launched our new CEREC Ortho 1.2 software and the new self-ligating bracket system In-Ovation X. This is the first meaningful innovation of self-ligating brackets in many years and reduces both treatment time and professional chair time compared to the current standard of care in this category.", "Our lab business has a slew of new products in the market. Materials like Celtra Press and Cercon xt are driving momentum in the marketplace. We continue to invest in research and development as well as our sales and service infrastructure. With over 4,000 sales and service professionals around the globe, our reach is unparalleled in the industry. Our merger is enabling us to make these investments as we generate cost savings. We have many multiple reorganizations and country formation projects in process. Our cost synergies programs remain on track and will ramp into 2018.", "Top-line growth remains at the forefront of our priorities and strategies, but we will also remain committed to driving leverage through our P&L and driving increased profitability. We anticipate earnings growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. Finally, our capital allocation continues to be a key component of our strategy. With our strong balance sheet, we remain focused on our pipeline of deals and a disciplined approach. In addition to acquisitions, we intend to consistently return capital to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for Dentsply Sirona.", "We are pleased to announce our new agreements with Henry Schein and with Patterson today. We are truly excited about the possibility of growing together. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our employees. Integrating two companies can be difficult and many have been working tirelessly to make Dentsply Sirona a success. Their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients is inspiring.", "We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. We will now take our first question from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "I guess, Jeff, starting with the Henry Schein deal. Can you speak to the importance or the somewhat earlier start date, being September 1? I was previously under the impression that the Patterson exclusivity would run through the end of September. And is there any relevancy to the three-year period? And I guess, part two, maybe for Joshua. You seem to point to a slightly or a wider band for the inventory de-stocking headwind this year, $50 million to $60 million versus the prior $50 million. Can you just elaborate on the shift there?", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Thanks, Brandon; important question. Of course, we're celebrating today the announcement of Henry Schein. As we stated on our call in February, the transition to opening up distribution has its challenges. And we made it clear that we were changing our go-to-market and we felt, as an organization and working with Patterson, that this was the right time to be able to announce this.", "This is a significant decision for us. We also felt, by doing this now, we were able to stay focused on our exclusivity with Patterson through the summer, but be able to bring Schein on for our September and our DS World, as we move forward to the back half of our year. The significance of the three years is just an initial term for us. We expect to be doing business with our full distributed lines with Schein for years to come. We're very excited about how our teams have worked together, as we've seen the success in Europe and what we've been able to do on the distributed consumable side with Henry Schein.", "The time is now, ever since it was announced that we would be changing our strategy and opening it up, and to get the clarity in the marketplace were exactly what we're doing. In the absence of clarity, we have issues with our customers, we have issues with distribution reps, we have rumors, and frankly, we have our own people wondering what's going to happen. Now we have that clarity about how we're moving forward and this is important.", "And certainly, we have confidence in our long-standing relationship with Patterson on the technology side, certainly, it's been 20 years of exclusive with CEREC which is very special to us. Henry Schein has had and continues to have a special relationship with us, has had exclusive and continues to have CEREC exclusive in many areas. And bringing it all together today, allows us to move forward in a very powerful way, get the field to focus on the exclusive they have, to understand the way forward for us and to get down to what's most important, and that's taking care of the customer and executing on our plan, which is why we talked about the second half being where we expect it to grow faster.", "Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Hey, Brandon, this is Josh. Just on the question about the band of inventory. I think you're referring to what we said last quarter, when we talked about a $50 million net impact. Just to be clear on what I had mentioned was that we expect a $50 million to $60 million impact going forward from here on out, with the bulk of that happening in Q2. The net impact of all of this should be $10 million to $20 million the remainder of the year. I think it's hard to pinpoint a specific number obviously, because ultimately inventory is a function of retail performance. And as Jeff alluded to, transition can cause some slowness there, but of course, clarity is important to help get that going again.", "So I think from a modeling perspective, the way you should think about it is, $50 million to $60 million, bulk of that in Q2, and then like I said, remainder of the year, $10 million to $20 million. If there's a little bit more than $50 million, we think there're opportunities that we might be able to offset it with some other market channels, but again we'll continue to keep you updated.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Thank you, Brandon.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.", "Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Thank you, guys. I guess two questions. The first one, just \u2013 are there going to be any differences in how you support Patterson and Schein for maybe a sales and education perspective? Does that mean we need to think about margin profile of your business through Schein or Patterson as different at all between the two in the U.S? That's the first question.", "And then Josh, just on those inventory comments. I guess I completely misunderstand in here. Guidance as of last quarter was that we would see $40 million to $60 million of the inventory headwinds for the year. We saw, I believe, $40 million to $50 million in the first quarter. Now you're saying there's another $50 million to $60 million \u2013 where's this $50 million to $60 million all of a sudden coming from? That's a new number to me. So if you can help me out there, that would be great. Thanks.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Okay. Jeff, Patterson has a 20-year experience with our product offering and infrastructure and training available today. We will work with Schein. We have a plan in place that we are not going to compromise our customers on their training and education of this and that's why we're confident about bringing on both distributors because of our ability to take care of the customer and expand our reach. And we have a lot of confidence in Henry Schein's capability to do this. With regard to the margin profile, we're not going to get into the contracts that's been agreed to by both parties, but we are confident that the way we've set up our structure benefits both Henry Schein and Patterson.", "Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "So Jeff, just to, again, go back on the inventory. We talked about a net number for the year last call. You saw an impact this quarter and I talked about the $50 million to $60 million additional impact going forward. That will be bulk of it in Q2, could leak into Q3 as well. And then of course, we talked about is a net number, which means we believe there's some offset opportunity from other channels coming online.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Yeah. Jeff, I think it's important to understand that what we're talking about at the end of the day is $50 million to $60 million. We absolutely believe that as other channels come online, there will be a net effect. So we have not changed from that perspective and we certainly also believe that there are global implications of this and opportunities for us.", "Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Thank you, operator. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks. A couple. First, was there any \u2013 I mean, if we look \u2013 Technologies were still down just under 4% after adjusting for Patterson. Can you maybe just talk about how much of that was a pre-IDS slowdown? I think Schein, this morning, talked about 197 deduction for (37:01) forward sales in the year-end. So do you have any impact there, or is this also just a function of Patterson reps maybe losing a little bit more focus?", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Well, I think, certainly that played a role in this. That's why we wanted to get the clarity out there to the field exactly what was going on. There were too many rumors that we're stalling fails and that was critical to what was important there. And certainly ahead of the IDS, it always stall sales as they look forward to see what we're going to bring out. Now on our last call, we've talked about announcing 50 new products and technology and that certainly played a role for us. We were pleased though with what we were seeing, particularly in Germany and Southern Europe, but there was, in general, slowdown.", "And this doesn't just affect Europe, but this affects other parts of the world as they are looking to find out what exactly is Dentsply Sirona, but I would also highlight that our Consumables showed consecutive sequential growth in Europe ahead of this. There were no delays there. We feel good about what that tells us, we're able to do in the marketplace, but it is a function of \u2013 this was our first IDS together. The marketplace wanted to see what's Dentsply Sirona really about.", "Frankly, yes, we've been together for a year, but the IDS is such a big showcase. And to be able to see the order intake and reach records for all of our product areas and segments. And in fact, CAD/CAM benefit and specifically, CEREC, clear double-digits from us coming together. As we've always said, at Dentsply Sirona, we believe we'll accelerate the adoption of our technologies.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just one follow up on CEREC dynamics. Obviously, we saw Schein did a deal with Ivoclar. Well, can you just maybe talk on some of the shifting pieces you're seeing in the market on competitive dynamics, I guess, in general for CAD/CAM? And maybe the post-IDS reception to you guys opening up CEREC?", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Yeah sure. In a moment, I'm going to pass the call to Chris. This highlights what we've been saying to the market for years. The market is going digital. Single-visit dentistry matters to the dental professional and the patient. You cannot ignore that whether you're a materials company or an equipment company. And I would argue every dental company understands the impact that this megatrend is having. And of course, this IDS showcased the fact that Dentsply Sirona is in the best position, but of course we're going to have competitors come on to try to play a role in this. As we've said, we're only 17% penetrated in the U.S. Imagine what it is around the rest of the globe. With that, I'll turn it to Chris.", "Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Yeah. Tycho, it's Chris. I think this is case when you're successful in market, it's going to attract attention. I think that's what we have here. And as Jeff mentioned, digital dentistry is here to stay. We're at tipping point. From a competitive standpoint, more attention to the category is going to drive more interest and that's going to accelerate penetration. And we think that's good for us. Obviously we've got a good healthy respect for our competition. We're staying close to technological developments, but that's it. We're also very pleased with our technology platform that comes from over 20 years of experience and continuously leading both in innovation and also in markets insight.", "So again, we're the clear leader here. We're the basis for doctors being able to perform single-visit dentistry. We're pleased with the near-term innovations, including CEREC Open and the new software that Jeff mentioned earlier. And we're continuing to make significant investments in our R&D portfolio to stay on the forefront of technology. So again, we're pleased with our position, and again, I think that overall, more attention on the category is going to helpful to accelerating penetration.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Certainly, 30 years of experience, R&D, knowhow and the team we have in place, with not only equipment, but materials today is even stronger for the future for our CEREC.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "You bet.", "Operator", "As a reminder, we are taking one question from each caller in the interest of time. We'll take our next question from Mr. Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I want to just follow-up in a specific way on the Rest of World piece. And then, just a couple of clarifications. On Rest of World, the result was a little bit below our model. I wonder if you can reflect and I guess, it isn't necessarily have to be specific to Rest of World, on the timing of the IDS. If you look at the last few iterations of the IDS it was middle of month. You had a couple of weeks in there to complete deliveries. Did the timing of the IDS being close to the end of March, the end of the quarter have any impact? And then I have a follow-up.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Steve, it's tough to say how much timing of the IDS would play, but keep in mind that we had a difficult comp coming in, 7.5% last year and after finishing the year strong. We still believe that the Rest of World will be our fastest growing region. That hasn't changed. We've got 120 countries in the Rest of World. Asia was slower than we expected, but we expect that, that will improve in the second quarter and make up for the slowness on that.", "We were pleased what we saw in Latin America growth, even given the restructuring efforts there. So we expect that Rest of World will play a critical role in the future. I think, clarifying how we're going forward in Canada, that plays a role in Rest of World and our North America will support that and that had an impact, but in general, the offering we have in Rest of World, we expect to continue to generate sales in the back half of the year.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks for that. And I just want to follow-up on Jeff's question actually about equipment trends. I mean, given what you've seen in the DTA data, the consolidated industry data on equipment trends in the U.S. through the first quarter, how are you thinking about the equipment demand profile, not necessarily in a Dentsply Sirona specific way, but the trajectory for equipment demand in the U.S? Thanks.", "Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Yeah. Steve, it's Chris. First off, in terms of the DTA data, there's no longer any DTA on large equipment available. So from that standpoint, again, some of the market data that may have been available is no longer. That said as we look at it, it's a little bit tough for us in terms of a barometer for the factors that Jeff mentioned, obviously, with the go-to-market strategy change, but in the quarter not announcing the clarity in terms of exactly what that is, we do think it had an impact on us. As we look at it, we do think that underlying demand is solid and stable, but it was probably not the quarter to use as the barometer for that.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "And again, today, we announced a major change in our go-to-market in the U.S. And this is one that is going to have a short and long-term impact for Dentsply Sirona, and we need to focus on how important that will affect our equipment sales with both in place and our ability for Paterson to finish strong before September. Keep in mind that as we go into DS World, we'll now have a new message to the marketplace about what's possible for them. And this should make it easier for the reps to be able to sell the product and the adoption to increase.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks a bunch.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "You bet.", "Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair.", "John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks very much. Jeff, just expand a little bit on the comment you made in the call about feeling like you're underpenetrated in the group practices. I think that was mainly a U.S. comment. Is your go-to-market strategy changing beyond adding Schein? If you could just expand on how you're going to push more into DSOs, that will be helpful? Thanks.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Well look first of all, I think, we have a strong practice in the DSOs. Keep in mind, we go through distribution and direct with our specialty products. That won't change, but we're aggressively going after DSOs by bringing together how we present ourselves with the DSO to make sure they get the full benefit of our clinical education, our 360 programs and have integrated solutions deal with the full facets of what we're able to provide, root to crown, Class II procedures, implantology.", "By being able to focus that, we believe we'll have more of an impact in the DSOs. So there's a lot of opportunity for us, because we want to not only improve our share of wallet, but increase the number of DSOs that we're working with. We're already working with most of the largest DSOs. So it is about putting our organization together, investing in those resources and being able to make sure that the focus is on an area that's growing faster than the market.", "John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks for the question. Yeah just wanted to go back to the softer equipment number. The inventory wind-down does seem to be a bit of a moving target. So I'm just curious at this point, how much confidence do you feel like you have in this revised number? Is that something that you've worked more closely with Patterson to get your hands around?", "And then just related to that, Jeff, I believe you mentioned weaker retail performance in your prepared remarks, particularly in the U.S. as something that was a headwind or a drag. Could you maybe just elaborate a little bit on what you meant by retail performance and how that's separate from the inventory issue that we've discussed?", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Sure. Again, I think that comes back to the clarity of what's happening in the market. Bob, I can't tell you how many reps are hearing that we're imminent to opening up distribution. The distractions that, that has had, which has created uncertainty and uncertainty is never good for a rep, for an organization. And that had impact in what we were able to sell. I think with this clarity and the fact with our confidence with Patterson and what we've been able to do over the last 20 years with the exclusivity, we can get back to doing what we want to focus on, which is executing and selling the product. You also have to keep in mind that last year we introduced a new way of thinking about Chairside, with using Zirconia. We came out with the SpeedFire, which also led to changes in our milling unit, wet-dry. Those also had impacts for the prior year on this.", "Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Bob, with regard to inventory \u2013 this is Josh, just to provide clarity. So recognize there was a $40 million change year-over-year related to inventory. That was Q1, right? We talked about an additional $50 million to $60 million coming, right, but for the remainder of the year, a net of $10 million to $20 million, which is to say that there's going to be an offset to that.", "So what we've said is, last call we talked about $50 million. We're talking about a similar range here. Again, ultimately retail, it will dictate how much or how little this will be, but we're still in the general range as we're talking about. So it's never a perfect target, but I don't want to give you the impression that it's a moving target. It's still within the same range. It's just a function of, remember, we talked about this being a tale of two halves in terms of the year. We talked about the first half having a significant headwind in inventory. We talked about strong growth in the back half of the year, right? We reiterated our guidance and so we're just reiterating that same message.", "We obviously had the first impact in Q1. You'll continue to see impact in Q2 and you'll get the benefit of the other market or the channels coming on line, which will offset that headwind in the back half of the year which will drive our growth. So the net is in the same realm, right. Again, we can't pinpoint it exactly, but I don't want you to walk away thinking there's a significant change here, because there isn't.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "No there really isn't. Again, the big picture is about the net result for the year. And we haven't changed that. We've said the first quarter was going to be challenged. And actually, it would also be the first half and it was all about the second half. So I want to be clear that we continue to be on track believing that what we gave the guidance, and that's why we haven't changed our guidance.", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel.", "Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll try to ask both upfront. So first one, Jeff, just your thoughts on capital allocation and possibly getting more aggressive on the share repo. It seems like you're sensing or seeing the worldwide dental market picking up. You've got broader distribution going forward. You called out several times you expect momentum to increase in the back half of the year and sort of continue into 2018 and you're sitting here on a very solid balance sheet. So just your thoughts on maybe flexing the balance sheet a bit more here in the near-term.", "And then the second question, just quickly is a lot of moving parts for 2Q. I mean, you guys have hit on inventory but you also have sort of the ship outs going on from IDS. So curious if you want to give any clarity on the EPS cadence on line and just how to think about the moving parts for the remainder of the year? Thanks guys.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Right. We have a clear buy back in place. We've already deployed over $1 billion in capital \u2013 in acquisitions and buy back. We continue to do that. That's an important lever. We have a very strong balance sheet, which we will continue to use. So I don't see that changing. Certainly, that's part of what we've talked about. We also said that we were going to do $50 million to $100 million per quarter. We did $85 million this quarter. So we're staying on track with what we believe. With regard to the EPS, clearly we don't get into quarterly guidance, but the back half assumes that we expect to have acceleration on that.", "Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Thank you, operator. Next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Bank of America.", "Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, thanks. Good morning, Jeff, Chris, Josh and Derek. So I know you guys can't talk too much about the terms of these new U.S. distribution deals, but I guess I first have a question is, will a U.S. sale of CEREC through Schein be more profitable to you than what CEREC unit profit margin has been under Patterson previously? And then also is Schein going sell just CEREC in the U.S. for Chairside, CAD/CAM, crown restoration, or are they still going to have the option to sell other Chairside crown restoration systems if they want to? Thanks.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Thanks for the question. Again, this is about Schein having our full distributed line. They'll have everything with regard to CAD/CAM as well as our imaging products, our Treatment Centers and our instruments. We're not going to get into margin profile. Obviously, we believe that this structure is in the best interest of both parties and it's about accelerating growth for both of us.", "Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And the other quick thing, this is more of a comment than really just a question, but I still don't really get the notion of the Patterson's sales force distraction, that they know they're still going to be selling it going forward. You think they'd want to work harder to lock-in sales before a new distributor comes in. I don't understand why they'd lay down in this situation but again that's sort of the sidebar comment I guess I'll look forward to seeing you guys at our conference next week and we can hopefully talk about this in more detail. Thanks.", "Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Look, again, until you have clarity in the market, it leads to confusion. And you have to understand that, that is the fact. When Patterson on their call in November announced that they would be opening up distribution with it, that brought certain uncertainty for the marketplace. We feel we've dealt with that. I mean, we're very excited with what we've announced today with Patterson as well and we think that will have an impact for us. So both Henry Schein and Patterson, coming together understanding what is going to be exactly what we do moving forward will allow everyone to focus on execution.", "Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Matt Miksic from UBS.", "Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. This is Vik Chopra in for Matt. Thanks for taking my questions and squeezing me in. I just wanted to ask a quick question on the Consumables business, kind of what areas of strength you've seen, maybe specialty versus general products? And what you're seeing in terms of ASPs? And my second question is on gross margins. How should we think about gross margins heading into the rest of year? And can we expect any expansion over last year? Thanks.", "Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Yeah. Vik, it's Chris. Relative to the Consumables, I mean we have pretty solid and consistent growth really across the various SBUs, if you will, both on the Chairside as well as on the specialties, particularly solid, relative to endo. Again we look pretty solid underlying U.S. sell-through trends which again, we're pleased with. Europe was very solid from a core Consumables standpoint.", "So again, I think, that we feel good about how that business is executing. There's a number of new innovations that we showed at the IDS. New products really do drive those businesses pretty significantly, which again we're pleased with what we've brought to market. And again I think that relative to the margins or the pricing, again we're able to hold price fine. We're able to take reasonable price generally on these businesses. So again I don't think we see any significant change in those competitive dynamics.", "Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Vik, as far as gross margin for the year, we don't get into that level of detail. What I would tell you is that this quarter, margins were impacted by the timing of the merger last year. Remember, last year had the strongest selling month for Sirona, so that gave us a difficult comparison. We talked about margins year-over-year in terms of operating margins to be similar to last year, but that actually implies underlying growth because again, you'll recall that last year we benefited from that strong selling month. So overall, remember gross margins, you have a lot of moving parts in there between product mix and FX. And so we'll just talk about the operating margin level for the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to our moderators for any additional or closing remarks.", "Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc.", "Well thank you, everyone, for joining us today on today's conference call, and thanks for your interest on Dentsply Sirona. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming conferences and of course, we'll update you again on August. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

(NASDAQ:XRAY) Q4 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call March  2, 2018  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Josh Zable - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Don Casey - Chief Executive Officer, Director", "Nick Alexos - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer", "Analysts", "Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Jeff Johnson - Baird", "Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs", "Jon Block - Stifel", "Erin Wright - Credit Suisse", "John Kreger - William Blair", "Yi Chen - H.C. Wainwright", "David Stratton - Great Lakes Review", "Operator", "Good day and welcome to the Dentsply Sirona, Incorporated fourth quarter and year-end 2017 earnings call. Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn things over to Mr. Josh Zable, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Josh Zable", "Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 conference call. I would like to remind you that an earnings press release and presentation is available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com.", "Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slide two and three of our earnings slide presentation. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.", "And, with that, I will now turn the program over to Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona.", "Don Casey", "Thanks Josh and good morning everyone. This is the first time some of you are meeting either Nick Alexos or myself, so we really appreciate you joining us. I would like to accomplish a few things this morning. The first is to provide some of my initial impressions. The second is to outline some key areas. And finally, I will discuss what you can expect from this management team going forward.", "While it's very early in my tenure, as a fact this marks the end of week three for me, much of what I have seen confirms my rationale for accepting this role. It also reinforces why I am confident that my previous experiences align well with what DENTSPLY SIRONA will need going forward. The few weeks have underscored that this is a great company in an attractive market, but is one that's also coming off a challenging year in terms of financial performance as well as one with lots of changes in management. We have now turned the page on that.", "We have a new management team in place that is excited about our future. Looking at that future, I know we have several great assets that we can leverage. They include being the number one or two brands in multiple consumable categories. These categories provide a reliable and stable source of growth. But beyond that, each of these brands represents an opportunity to build a relationship with dentists and labs, whether in areas like endodontics, preventive, restorative, our products touch hundreds of thousands of dentists around the globe each year, all of which represent an opportunity to start a conversation.", "Our leadership position in technology and equipment such as CAD/CAM and imaging is another major strength and is an important foundation for future growth. It is up to us to better leverage that relationship to bring in all aspects of our portfolio to these dentists that are already very committed to DENTSPLY SIRONA.", "In some places, we are beginning to see the power of combining our differentiated products into one offering. Among the many examples we could cite is a program where we now offer digital impression with the implant in a novel program to cross-sell both products. This not only improves our value proposition versus the competition but is driving new sales leads for both franchises. And as a matter of fact, we are starting to see implants return to growth after two down years.", "This is a model that we would like to replicate in several other product categories. But our competitive advantage is more than just offering leading products. We can bring the power of our clinical education and training along with our products to truly become a solution provider. Having such a broad portfolio allows us to be a leader in this space that no other competitor can match.", "We bring this broad education and training portfolio to our customers on a daily basis in the market and through major events like Dentsply Sirona World. Our breadth also gives us a lot of flexibility in creating novel win-wins for our important dealer-partners such as Patterson and Henry Schein. Going forward, our entire team understands the need to take the potential of DENTSPLY SIRONA and turn it into performance.", "An initiative that was kicked off late last year brought our senior leadership team together to identify our top five priorities. They are starting to bear fruit and we will continue to push them. They include delivering on the concept that we are the dental solutions company and acting as one team globally. But I would also like to highlight two of these initiatives that I will personally own, growth and margin improvement.", "Our growth plans going forward will be built around a few key priorities. The first is sales force effectiveness. At DENTSPLY SIRONA, we have 30-plus sales force and close to 5,800 people globally in sales and sales-support. It is essential that we improve the performance of this group. That includes targeting, messaging, training, use of sales force productivity tools, all while providing outstanding customer service and it includes teaching our businesses how to cross-sell each other to take advantage of our unique portfolio. And finally, but not least, there needs to be a renewed focus on our customers. For the past two years, we have been too internally focused. That changes now.", "The second key to growth will be to accelerate the pace of innovation. This is our life blood. We will do this by really understanding our customers, looking globally at their needs, reallocating investment into higher-margin areas and creating urgency. I strongly believe that we can take our industry-leading R&D budget and redirect it into high-impact projects that give us a better competitive position. In a rapidly changing competitive space, our technology portfolio is unmatched. It gives us a tremendous amount of optionality and it will serve as an important foundation for our leadership in the ongoing digital revolution in dentistry. It is our intent that innovation will be at the heart of everything we do.", "Our final focus area will be to grow into rapidly developing areas around the globe such as Asia, Latin America and the Middle East where we have a long history and excellent sales foundation and also a tremendous opportunity. We will make more investment and resources available where we can see near and mid-term returns. Our urgency in restarting our growth engine is high.", "One way we will deliver is taking immediate action. Yesterday, we announced the change in our management structure. Going forward, the commercial leaders as well as the two R&D leads will now report directly in to me. I intend to be a hands-on leader and believe this structure will accelerate decision-making and increase accountability. I want to thank Bob Size for his contributions over the years and for taking on the interim leadership role during our management transition.", "Another area of particular emphasis will be accelerating growth within our technology and equipment business. Having concluded initial reviews, I am confident that we have a very strong product portfolio that we will be looking to augment over the mid-term. I have also had the opportunity to spend a significant amount of time with both our leadership team and that of our critical partners, Henry Schein and Patterson. I believe that we have put solid plans in place to drive growth in the equipment areas and we will look to strengthen those plans together in the future. We have also worked with them to get better visibility into our movement of the product at the end market. This retail visibility will allow us to rapidly determine the impact of our efforts and adjust them as needed.", "In addition to growth, the second of the priorities that I personally own is our program to improve margins. We have scale but we need to put it to use. Our team is focused on delivering $100 million in cost savings over the next two years. Given the early stage we are at in areas like procurement, rationalizing our manufacturing footprint and looking to make our operating model more efficient, I believe that we have significant runway in these areas. Some of these savings are being reinvested today, but we will begin yielding margin improvement, both in the back half of the year and beyond.", "The final point that I would like to make is what we, as a management team, aspire to be. We believe that we can and should be a growth company, built on industry-leading go-to-market capability, world-class R&D and being a global solution provider. We will selectively add to our organic efforts through licensing and when appropriate, acquisitions. We understand that we need to deliver on our commitments consistently and with transparency. Our team is committed to doing just that.", "I am not na\u00efve about this challenge and it's going take some time. But I just returned from the Chicago mid-winter event where I got to walk the floor, meet with multiple customers, talk to KOLs and I got to see our team in action. It's impressive. As part of my onboarding, I have had the pleasure of meeting literally hundreds of DENTSPLY SIRONA employees that all have an amazing passion and commitment to this company. All of this highlights the tremendous opportunity to go from talking about the potential of DENTSPLY SIRONA to delivering consistent performance. I look forward to getting to spend time with the investment community in the future.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Nick Alexos, who will provide a more detailed look into our results and our underlying assumptions for our 2018 outlook. Nick?", "Nick Alexos", "Thanks Don and good morning everyone. I have been equally impressed by the caliber of our people, the strength of our businesses and the opportunities we can pursue to add value to all our constituents. It's also been a great month for us working with Don from the date of his announcement.", "Let me start by commenting on our 10-K. By now, you have seen that we filed a Form 12b-25 for an extension of our filing date. We expect to file the 10-K by early next week and certainly prior to the expiration of the extension. Given our determination of an impairment, the complexities of tax reform passed last year and frankly the recent management changes, the extra days are helpful. Please be assured in my confidence in the financial controls of our organization, which brings me to the impairment charge.", "For Q4 2017 period,, we took a charge of $848 million to reflect evaluation related to our technology and equipment assets. This is comprised of $267 million related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and $581 million on goodwill. The charges are due to changes in projected operating performance as well as changes to our tax and foreign exchange rates. I will speak to each of these.", "In simple terms, although we shipped orders as planned in Q4 of 2017, our retail sell via our channel partners in certain markets was less than we expected. Rather than decreasing channel inventory by $30 million as was referenced in our November Q3 call, we ended with an increase of $21 million, mostly in imaging and CAD/CAM units in the U.S. and to a limited degree in other geographic regions. As a result, we have a lower growth rate in 2018 to reflect a now targeted $40 million of equipment inventory reduction and lower consumption as well as slightly reduced long-term growth rates in margins for these reporting units. Fundamentally, we still believe the growth rate of our technology and equipment segment to be in the mid-single digit range and our CAD/CAM unit to be above that.", "2017 was clearly a transition year, especially in North America, but our dual distribution model makes sense and we value our partnership with both Patterson and Henry Schein. Importantly, we have now aligned to better track our inventory and as Don mentioned, we are aggressively working on our sales and marketing strategies globally. In April, for example, our imaging equipment was seamlessly will integrate into Henry Schein's dentists' practice management software for the first time. We anticipate that this should help boost sales of imaging products in the back half of the year. We are also very confident in our continued partnership with Patterson leveraging their significant customer service infrastructure for their equipment sales.", "The second and separate element of the impairment charge is the calculated higher effective tax rate, which was primarily driven by U.S. tax reform legislation past December of 2017. Although recent tax will reduce the U.S. statutory rate from 35% to 21%, other aspects of the legislation actually diminish the use of foreign tax credits as well as our ability to defer tax on foreign income. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions continue to reform their tax policies and broaden their tax base. Since DENTSPLY SIRONA's effective tax rates are expected to marginally increase over time, the projected net cash flows associated with the evaluated assets were reduced.", "The third element of the impairment charge relates to changes in the foreign exchange rate projections versus the fair value model that was completed for the April 30, 2017 annual goodwill impairment testing. In general terms, while stronger foreign currencies and especially the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar are good for the company's total earnings, a strong Euro in particular increases the cost structure of the equipment reporting units which are primarily based in Germany and Austria. This in turn unfavorably impacts the fair value of these reporting units as a result of the reduction in their profitability.", "At the same time, while the fair value is lessened from the strengthening of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar, the book value of these reporting units increase at December 31, 2017 as a result of the significant underlying Euro based balance sheet values of these German and Austrian operations. For the fiscal year 2017, the total impairment charge related to these assets is now over $2 billion which is meaningful, although a non-cash charge.", "The historical successes of our technology products has no doubt drawn increased competitive offerings in the market which has also pressured margins. As Don highlighted, we as a company have not executed on several facets. Nonetheless, our forecasted growth is based on our continuing investments in innovative technologies in both our technology and equipment and consumables segments and investments in our global sales and marketing efforts working along our channel partners.", "Now let me review some of the highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year. As provided in our supplemental financials, this quarter we began reporting in two segments as part of our priority to simplify the business. This also represents how we intend to drive the strategies of the company. You can find the detailed historical growth rates of these segment and regions in the financial supplements provided along with our press release and the earnings presentation.", "For the fourth quarter, constant currency total sales increased 5.3%, driven by technologies and equipment, which increased 5.8%. As I said earlier, based on our estimates, total technology and equipment sales were favorably impacted by approximately $21 million in equipment inventory build during the quarter. Consumables constant currency sales grew at 4.6% with broad growth across categories, which is a pretty solid quarter for them", "Regionally, the U.S. posted strong growth but was the beneficiary of what we estimate to be $23 million in channel equipment inventory build during the quarter. This overlaps the $21 million I just mentioned for the total sales figure. Europe was up 2.6%, also driven by stronger technology and equipment growth and the rest of world was up 3.7%. All of these percentages are in a constant currency basis.", "When we look at revenues for the year, it's a similar story. Sales of the combined businesses, which is the pro forma for a January 1, 2016 merger date,, grew 1.6% on a constant currency basis. The U.S. benefited from what we estimate to be full year $38 million in channel inventory build but it was down in total for the year at a negative 0.5%. Europe was up 4.1% pro forma on a constant currency basis. And the rest of world was only up slightly for the full year at 0.8% on the same basis.", "As Don said, the integration impacted our rest of the world organization, which grew significantly lower than it should. As you will also see, the consumables sector for the year grew at 3.7% whereas technology and equipment was marginally negative, once again on a constant currency basis. In general, we believe our end markets are stable and growing. Our performance should improve with better execution as we have discussed.", "Turning to margins for the quarter. We improved our adjusted margin rate versus a year ago, which was a function of stronger product and regional mix and higher volumes creating SG&A leverage. For the year, adjusted operating margins declined as our expenses grew while our sales did not. We have made some growth investments that take 12 to 18 months to deliver and we should start to see the benefit of them in the back half of 2018.", "Q4 reported GAAP EPS was a loss of $2.95 and the full year GAAP EPS was a loss of $6.86, both reflecting the impairment charges we have discussed. Adjusted EPS for Q4 was a positive $0.82 and for the full year 2017 adjusted EPS was $2.66, which is in line with the updated guidance provided in November. As I said earlier, shipments was as planned in Q4, but the retail sales in equipment lagged our expectation.", "Cash flow from operating activities was $602 million, up 6.8% for the year despite increases in net trade working capital that needs to be reduced. Operating cash flow is an important indicator of the health of our business and an area we can improve. CapEx for the year was $144 million. This is something that we will also monitor to ensure that capital spend is delivering appropriate returns.", "During the quarter, you will note that we executed on two small transactions, one in preventive and one in endo. Over the year, we spent $153 million in small tuck-in acquisitions that will help us grow faster.", "Now turning to guidance. Our guidance includes the following assumptions. Full-year constant currency sales growth around 3%, free any meaningful acquisitions or divestitures that have not closed yet. At the current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.25 billion for 2018. As I discussed earlier, our revenue assumptions include about $40 million targeted reduction in dealer equipment inventory, which is costing us about a 1% growth rate overall. We expect to reduce a large portion of the dealer equipment inventory levels in the first part of the year, which will clearly impact the performance of the U.S. business. Also keep in mind that Europe faces last year's IDS comps as well in Q1.", "We expect gross margins and operating margins to be flat to slightly down versus 2017 as underlying margin rate improvement in businesses are expected to be offset by foreign exchange effects and the headwind from the target inventory equipment reductions. As Don mentioned, we are committed to delivering $100 million in operating cost savings by fiscal year 2019 and we expect more than half of that to be in 2018. Although we expect the savings to result in increased margin over time, as I mentioned 2018 margins are being impacted by the foreign exchange, the inventory reductions and certain investments during the year. Below the operating line, we have also taken steps to reduce our interest expense by approximately $20 million. Overall, we have a very low cost debt structure and ample availability to grow our businesses and make acquisitions.", "On taxes, as I said, there is a meaningful change in the non-GAAP effective tax rate from 17.4% in 2017 to now estimated 22% for 2018. Once again, this is based on the changes in the U.S. tax legislation, which reduce our foreign tax credits and limit our abilities to defer foreign tax income. Please note, only approximately 35% of our revenues are from the U.S.", "CapEx guidance for the year is expected to be similar to 2017. There are clearly many variables to our EPS guidance throughout the income statement, which we manage. Excluding $0.16 impact due to the change in non-GAAP effective tax rate I had outlined, our guidance of $2.70 to $2.80 for 2018 underlines EPS growth rate of 8% to 11%. We have not incorporated any material share repurchases into this guidance. So to summarize, we believe we have taken the right actions to prepare for revenue, profit growth and strong cash flows in 2018 and margin improvement over time.", "And I turn the call over to Don for some final remarks.", "Don Casey", "Thanks Nick. And I would really like to thank you and your entire team. It's been a very busy time and you have done a lot of really great work and I have spend just a tremendous month getting to know you and the entire team as well as the DENTSPLY SIRONA team.", "Before we open up to questions, I want to reemphasize how much we value your interest and we plan to organize an Investor Day at some point at one of our facilities. We also plan to provide you at that time with our long-term views on the business in terms of revenue growth, margin and capital allocation. We look forward to getting that date on your calendar shortly.", "I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And we will hear first from Glen Santangelo of Deutsche Bank.", "Glen Santangelo", "Hi. Good morning. Don, just wanted to talk to you about underlying growth trends. First, on the consumable side. 2017, I think most saw that consumable sales were probably a little bit lower than expected, as dental volumes were a bit lower, but now that you are the last dental company to report, we have heard from Danaher, Schein and Patterson and the numbers are kind of a little bit all over the place. So I just want to get your perspective, given your market share and your global reach, what are you all seeing in terms unit volumes and consumable sales on an organic basis?", "Don Casey", "Glen, thanks for the question. It's good to talk to you again. We feel pretty comfortable that we are seeing solid growth in the consumable areas. And look, we are a global business. Our bellwether, preventive and restorative business has pretty good growth over this year and we think we are probably gaining a little bit of share. So when you think about our consumable business on a constant currency basis growing about 4.6% and gaining a little bit of share, that would point to mid-single digit growth. So we feel that there is some good positive underlying trends. We like to think that some of that is due to our market share and the programs we are putting into place in the market.", "Next question.", "Operator", "And we will hear next from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson", "Hi. Good morning. In light of the impairment charge and the recalibration of the underlying growth for some of the businesses, can you talk a little bit more about the strategy to reaccelerate growth overall? Where are you making incremental investments? Is it aligners, CAD/CAM, implants or other areas? And when can we start to see some returns? And can you also talk a little about inorganic? How actively you are looking at M&A at this point?", "Don Casey", "Thanks for the question, Tycho. And I will start and I will ask Nick to amplify. Look, if you think about our CAD/CAM business, we are big, big believers in digital dentistry, chair side dentistry. And we are going to continue pushing that. One of the things that I have noted just literally right off the bat is an opportunity though to how do we expand and take some of our equipment that's got great footprints and playing more aggressively in the digital impression space. So that's the first thing we are doing and we are working immediately with our team to make sure that our customers understand that we in fact have equipment that will let them play in that space. So that's the first thing.", "The second, as you look at this space, it's gotten more competitive. When you build a really, really good, high-profit, high-growth category like CAD/CAM, you are going to invite competitors. So one of the things that we want to do is, first we want to continue driving innovation and I think we are pointing to, what we think will be a pretty good set of launches around the IDS show and beyond and we are going to continue to innovate in that space.", "The other thing, Tycho, I think I mentioned in my script, as you go through that, I am really excited about the opportunity to bring much more disciplined sales force effectiveness into this area. As we think about the relationship we have with our partners, both Patterson and Henry Schein, in the past we have relied a lot on them to create some of the demand and I think we are going to really begin to focus on how do we work with them, but also how do we take responsibility for creating the leads and ultimately driving our business. And I think you are going to start to see that in the back half of the year when we have a little bit of time with our management team to get after it.", "Nick, what would you want to add?", "Nick Alexos", "Yes. Tycho, I would just add that I think this process has highlighted a great way to prioritize opportunities to invest, both to drive growth as well as improve the operations of the business. And we want to do those in the context of the guidance that we have provided you.", "Don Casey", "Next question?", "Operator", "And we will hear next from Jeff Johnson of Baird.", "Jeff Johnson", "Thanks. Good morning guys. Can you hear me okay.", "Don Casey", "Yes.", "Jeff Johnson", "All right. Great. So Nick, maybe just to start with you or Don, either one. So over the last few years, I think we would all admit that innovation has been somewhat lacking at DENTSPLY. It sounds like you are going to take this first $50 million tranche of cost saving and reinvest it back into the business. I don't think anybody is going to argue with that. But I would like to hear kind of that second tranche of the $50 million out of the total $100 million. Do you think that flows through better? Does the first $50 million drive some better topline? I am just trying to think all the way to 2019 at this point. Do things start to flow through at a better rate there? And then Nick, just also wondering, you say no repurchase in the guidance. How do you feel about repurchases, especially with your stock at these depressed levels? I can understand not putting it in guidance, but just conceptually how do you think about the level of your stock at these levels? Thanks.", "Don Casey", "Yes. Jeff, first, thanks for the questions. I will let Nick jump in, in a second. There were two questions in there and let's talk about what are we investing in and I completely agree. We need to jumpstart our innovation engine and that's where we are putting some of it. Some of the savings are being driven right into innovation as well as sales force effectiveness. We need to improve some of the tactics, some of the messaging and some of the programs we are putting together. So that's the first thing.", "The second, as we think about the back half and where we want to grow and how do we want to grow, look, we have just begun to scratch the surface of how do we cross-sell. I mean the example that we talked about a second, a minute ago was about how do we take our imaging equipment and work better with implants. And we think we have got a lot of opportunities that way. When we talk about share repurchase, it's very, very early for me and I just want to emphasize, look, I want to grow and this is going to take us a little while to get our hands around this. This is why you don't see us coming right out the gate talking aggressively about share repurchase. And the priorities are, how do we grow, are there technologies or M&A that we can be doing that will accelerate growth. And then after that, we will commit to returning excess cash to shareholders. But right now, it's going to take us a little bit of time to get our arms around it. But I would tell you, our priorities are growth.", "Nick, I don't know what you want to add.", "Nick Alexos", "Yes. Jeff, I would just add, as you know and you heard, there are a lot of variables here and we feel very good of how we have brought them together to give you the guidance that we have provided. And in deference to the whole team and especially Don, there is a lot more work to do to prioritize. I look at the cost savings, the growth investments and cash flow somewhat independently. The cost savings were targeted to go after inefficiencies in the business and we feel very comfortable that we will get those. Separate from that, we are constantly looking at investments and have done some even in the last few months in order to either improve efficiencies or drive topline and those will overlap to some degree. And then cash flow will be the net result of an overall assessment of capital allocation strategies. As I noted, the guidance does not include any meaningful share repurchases. So give us a little bit of a buffer and range in terms of what we determine will be the right allocation of capital in 2018 and we will obviously update you guys during the year as we progress.", "Don Casey", "Thanks for the question, Jeff. Next question?", "Operator", "And we will hear next from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.", "Robert Jones", "Hi. Good morning, Don and Nick. Thanks for taking the question. I guess looking at the components of your 2018 guidance, it does seem like you are implying flat to maybe even down EBIT margins for the year? I would have thought you would see some improvement with the distributor change now largely behind you, you guys talked about the synergies ramping. So I guess how are you thinking about margins in 2018? I known, Nick, you mentioned seeing some margin pressure in the technology portfolio. But are there any other specific dynamics or headwinds that we should be thinking about for the margins in 2018?", "Nick Alexos", "Yes. Bob, very fair question and thank you. I would say the one notable element is, we do have significant foreign exchange variability, as I noted, with regard to the impairment. There is a significant cost structure for our European businesses and so that is definitely creating some margin pressure which also impacted the impairment value. Net net, we actually benefit from foreign currency or dollar weakening, foreign currencies improving, given the global nature of this business. But on a margin basis, it actually creates a bit of a headwind which is reflected in the numbers. We have a wide range of businesses and I can tell you, some will see margin improvement and in some other areas we will see some margin pressure. But the net amount is, as I said, slightly negative for the year is at least what we have penciled out.", "Don Casey", "Thanks Bob. Next question?", "Operator", "We will hear next from Jon Block of Stifel.", "Jon Block", "Great. Thanks guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask about long-term pricing power. There has been sort of that chatter that pricing power among the distributors may diminish over time. Schein has talked to repricing amongst DSOs. And I guess we need to see GPOs play out over time. But what does that mean for you guys as the leading manufacturer in the market? I would love to get your thoughts on, if you are insulated from that risk a little, a lot? And maybe you can talk to how prices played into your revenue growth over the past 24 months? And Nick, how you see that evolving going forward? Thanks.", "Don Casey", "Yes. Jon, first, thanks for the question. Look, we are going to focus on developing innovative and differentiated products and we are going to charge fair value for them. We are working well with the DSOs. We have got a terrific relationship with them. And as we view one of our imperatives to get after and focusing on the customer, we are going to work with them to understand how we can best serve their needs. But as I said in my script, I am very excited about the idea that we are going to be developing innovative products that are going to be differentiated and we would expect to get differentiated pricing.", "Nick Alexos", "Yes. I would just add, Jon, that there is no notable distinction in our pricing strategies going into 2018 or beyond. That's really left down at the trade level, as it makes sense in the field. And historically, yes, one of the things I liked about this business is that historically we are able to get reasonable price increases throughout our product lines.", "Operator", "And so we will hear next a question from Erin Wright of Credit Suisse.", "Erin Wright", "Great. Thanks. How should we think about the inventory build in the quarter? How is this communication between your distributor partners and the inventory management there? I guess, how are those supplier relationships progressing? What changes can be made at this point? And then more broadly, what does this say, if anything, on underlying demand trends on the equipment side? Thanks.", "Don Casey", "Yes. Erin, thank you for the question. First, we think we have got terrific relationships with both partners. As a matter of fact, at the mid-winter last week, we were able to spend a fair amount of time with the leadership of both companies and we reminded how important they are as part of our process. One of the things we emphasized in those meetings is that we really need to get visibility to the end user, almost retail sales, if you will, because not only do we need to understand the underlying inventory, we also need to be able to adjust our programs on the fly to see what's working and what's not working. So that's a program that both of us, both of the partners and us really want to emphasize and we think we have got good line on that.", "On the underlying trends, there's a couple of things on. I mean, the first is, there is more competition and the second, as you are bringing Henry Schein on and Patterson and they now have options to sell multiple things. So I think it's taking a little while for them to figure out how to drive business. In our meetings with both of our partners, we emphasize the need to grow our business and we think we put plans in place and we are pretty excited about where we are return to growth.", "One of the underlying trends, though, that we need to conscious of, in some cases you may have emphasis moving away from the chairside dentistry and the CAD/CAM and moving into a little bit more into DI where they are looking to just by pieces of the system versus the entire system. And again, we spent a fair amount of time with both Patterson and Henry Schein talking about what we think is just a much better patient experience, which is CAD/CAM and we want to be able to provide them as well as our own reps an opportunity to participate a little bit more aggressively in DI and that's why we are going to be pushing that as well.", "Next question. Thanks.", "Operator", "And will hear from John Kreger of William Blair.", "John Kreger", "Thanks very much. Don, you mentioned sales force effectiveness a few times. Can you just go back to that? Our perception is, legacy SIRONA and legacy DENTSPLY had fairly different sales strategies. So when you came in the door, what did you find? And do you feel like that the broad structure is in place? Or is there a fairly significant recasting that is necessary, from your point of view? Should be thinking about more salesman, less salesmen? Are you going to change where those sales forces are focused? Any elaboration will be helpful.", "Don Casey", "Thanks for the question, John. It is interesting. I think that there is a certain legacy DENTSPLY and a legacy SIRONA. One thing that I have actually brought in is the fact that I didn't come from either company and we are going to spend a lot of time as DENTSPLY SIRONA. And whether the culture came from more of the consumable side which is relatively consistent program or whether it's a little bit more of the highs and lows that go along with equipment sales, we need to actually begin to do a much better job of leveraging across each other.", "So when you think about our community of CEREC dentists, I mean that that to me is something that we need to leverage in a big, big way and we need to help the technology and equipment people learn to bring the consumables right along. And one of the things, John, that we are going to spend time is making sure that all our sales forces have the opportunity to at least create leads or begin to work with our distributor partners to bring our other products in there. And that's going to be a pretty aggressive priority.", "The second is, I don't think it's a big recast. I think some of it is, let's just talk about consistency. Consistency in targeting, consistency in message and in my mind, it is how do we bring sales force automation so that we are creating a great CRM program that allows the cross-selling that we are talking about. So again, having spent time with the sales forces that have spent most of their lives in the consumables business, they get excited, hey, if we can create leads, terrific. When we were talking to the technology and equipment people, they have really not thought about how do I actually bring some of these consumables. And an example that we cited in the script a little bit ago was actually how are we bringing implants and imaging together in a novel way. And that's got people's attention internally because it's starting to work. So I don't look at it as a big recast. I acknowledge that there are some differences in the legacy cultures but we are going to operate as one company. We are going to operate aggressively and sales force effectiveness is probably the most immediate way that we can pull a lever to really start accelerating sales this year.", "Next question.", "Operator", "And we will hear from Yi Chen of H.C. Wainwright.", "Yi Chen", "Thank you. Do you expect to recognize more goodwill impairments during 2018?", "Nick Alexos", "Just first, thanks for the question. Yes, the straightforward answer is no. We obviously have done a very thorough analysis of our business and the valuation of these assets and this is the determined impairment charge that we have calculated based on our long-range projections of the business.", "Don Casey", "Thank you. Next question.", "Operator", "And we will go to David Stratton of Great Lakes Review.", "David Stratton", "Good morning. Thanks for the question. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your near to mid-term investment in underdeveloped geographies and how that differs from what DENTSPLY SIRONA has done in the past and kind of where you see that trending going forward?", "Don Casey", "Yes. David, first, thanks for the question. It's really interesting when you come in and again at the end of week three, the thing that actually surprised me is just how much of a global company we are. We do are close to $1 billion in sales in some of these regions. And we have had tremendous legacy presence there and we have just begun to scratch the surface of what it looks like in bringing other products to these regions. So look, do they have all the people they need, all the investments they need and all the resources they need, probably not. And that's one of the things that I think I look forward to talking more about as we go forward in the future. But it's a region that's growing. It's got positive demographics. You have got the economies going the right way. And it's a place that we absolutely want to be growing.", "Next question.", "Operator", "And at this time there are no other questions in the queue. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Casey, CEO of DENTSPLY SIRONA for any closing comments.", "Don Casey", "Well, first, thank you very much. We look forward to getting back and talking to you in May. And as I indicated, we will be setting up an Investment Day at one of our sites a little bit later in the year and we look forward to getting that into your calendars. So thank you very much and everyone have a great day.", "Nick Alexos", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And again, that does conclude our call. We would like to thank you for your participation.
