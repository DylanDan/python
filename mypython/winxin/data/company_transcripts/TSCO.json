We ask that all participants limit themselves to one question.", "Please be advised that reproduction of this call in whole or in part is not permitted without written authorization of Tractor Supply Company. And as a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Christine Skold of Tractor Supply Company. Christine, please go ahead.", "Christine E.

Greg, please go ahead.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer, and Kurt Barton, our Chief Financial Officer.", "We experienced broad-based positive sales trends across our business in the second quarter. Store transaction counts were healthy at a positive 2.2% to last year and our average ticket trend improved by quarter end. Online traffic was also strong with unique visits up 28% and much more traffic coming from mobile devices.", "While our performance continued to be led by our animal and pet categories, we were pleased to see improved performance across many of our other major departments. With favorable weather conditions, the strong demand has continued for spring seasonal products and we believe the momentum has extended the selling season into the early weeks of the third quarter.", "For some time now, we have been sharing with you our initiatives to link the physical and digital components of our business to provide our customers one seamless shopping experience. Broadly speaking, we call this our One Tractor initiative and we are starting to see signs that the physical and digital sides of our business are working well together and support one another. As the connection between our stores and the online presence strengthens, we see evidence that these initiatives are improving our top-line results.", "We know that we have a dedicated, loyal customer who shops our stores for our unique merchandise offerings and our great customer service. We also know that the Internet is a powerful tool in retailing today. We strongly believe our unique merchandise assortment, conveniently located stores and experienced team members, along with our integrated digital store fronts are points of differentiation for us from other farm and ranch stores and online competitors.", "We continue to invest in initiatives to drive convenience, personalization, customer service, and operating efficiencies across our business. During the second quarter, we completed the rollout of our Buy Online Pick Up in Store program. We know this was a very important feature for our customers as it gives them greater flexibility and added convenience when shopping with us.", "They can place an order online, be assured the product is there at the store and pick up that order soon thereafter. They don't have to wait for the package to arrive or deal with the hassle of shipping back product, if a return is necessary and they can receive seasoned advice from our team members while shopping for other products in our stores. We continue to see positive response from our customers with over 55% of our online orders in the second quarter being picked up at our stores.", "Additionally, the average order value for a Buy Online Pick Up in Store transaction is larger than the total company average and we believe there is an opportunity for this program to increase our average basket size over time.", "Also in the second quarter, we continued to grow and develop our Neighbor's Club customer rewards program. This program was expanded to all stores in April and enrollment continues to grow very rapidly exceeding our initial expectations and we are now approaching 4 million members. Our Neighbor's Club members are some of our best and most engaged customers and we expect to strengthen our relationship with them by capturing and utilizing information regarding their buying habits and tailoring our communications to their particular product and information needs.", "As we develop our Neighbor's Club customer attribution data, we will be capable of improving our targeting to these customers and regularly inform them about new products and upcoming events that matter most to them. While very early in the program, we have noted that our higher Neighbor's Club membership stores are outperforming our lower penetration stores in sales. We believe there is a significant opportunity to leverage this program across our entire store base to drive our sales, customer insights and customer loyalty.", "Our Buy Online Pick Up in Store and Neighbor's Club programs are two sizeable initiatives that we have been developing for some time and are beginning to generate momentum. We believe both of these initiatives will be powerful sales drivers for years to come.", "Two other initiatives that we're testing and we believe could be meaningful longer term, are mobile POS and stockyard. Mobile POS is an in-store initiative that allows our associates to locate products, find information, check inventory in surrounding stores and process the sale through a mobile POS device. In our initial store test, mobile POS has already proven to be a great time saver for team members and our customers.", "And stockyard is another store level initiative that merges our online capabilities with our store operations. This initiative allows us to dramatically increase the selection of product offerings at store level using our vendors' inventories for fulfillment. Our team members can increase customer loyalty by offering our customer access to purchase items not normally carried in our stores and have them drop shipped to the location of their choice by extending our digital footprint utilizing tractorsupply.com.", "Today, we are a 24/7 retailer. We're using technology to make the shopping journey easier. While digital integration is important, we know that we are a successful brick-and-mortar retailer, opening new stores each year. Our customer appreciates our differentiated product offerings, our convenient locations and expects knowledgeable team members to assist them.", "We are constantly updating our product and event offerings to meet the needs of our customers that will in the end drive traffic into our stores and to tractorsupply.com. And we continue to execute new product resets year-round that deliver innovation, newness and provide greater value to our customers.", "To generate excitement and theater in our stores, we're adding a new fall Chick Days event this year and hosting a one day fall Farmers Market based upon the success we experienced in a test earlier this spring. We continue to see very high interest in locally sponsored store level events and strongly believe these events to support the communities that we serve. These events are another key differentiator for our business and they drive continued interaction with the brand.", "Now, with respect to Petsense, we are continuing to improve our understanding of that business model and have identified numerous merchandise and operational opportunities to grow that chain. I'm pleased with the performance of those stores that we've opened this year and will continue to see the benefits, as we bring this concept to rural communities with both quality brands and the added convenience of services such as grooming and the mobile vet offerings that we have.", "So in summary, I am encouraged with our execution this quarter and I believe that the long-term investments we are making, along with some moderation in the headwinds we have seen over the past 18 months, are beginning to positively impact our top-line results. As I said last quarter, we are confident we are investing in the areas that will drive sustainable, long-term growth, but we cannot guarantee that this growth will always be a smooth and linear path. We will, however, continue to be as transparent as possible about our business and we'll keep you updated on our progress.", "Before I turn the call over to Kurt, I want to extend a big thank you to all our team at Tractor Supply and Petsense, who continue to serve our customers and execute our business plan every day. You are the driving force behind our success.", "I'll now turn the call over to Kurt to take you through our second quarter financial results.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thanks, Greg and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended July 1, 2017, on a consolidated year-over-year basis, net sales were $2.02 billion, resulting in net income of $160.6 million and EPS of $1.25 per diluted share. Comparable store sales increased 2.2% versus a reported decrease of 0.5% last year.", "As a reminder, our Q2 2017 comparable store results reflect the calendar shift associated with the 53rd week in 2016. Adjusting for the week shift, last quarter's second quarter comparable store sales increase would have been a positive 1.0%. Also, this year's second quarter had one less sales day compared to the second quarter of 2016. We estimate the one less sales day impacted comparable store sales by approximately 60 basis points, and the comp store sales increase would have been approximately 2.8% on an equivalent quarter basis.", "Comp store sales performance rebounded nicely from the 2.2% decline in the first quarter. Comp stores were positive across all geographic regions and the sales by month was generally consistent throughout the quarter. From a merchandise standpoint, the sales growth was broad-based, with most of our major product categories experiencing positive comp store sales. Once again, the livestock and pet category led our comp performance and we continued to experience solid demand for many of our basic everyday items.", "Comparable store transaction count increased 2.2% or approximately 2.8%, adjusting for the one less sales day. This compares to prior year's reported 1.5% increase, or 2.7% adjusted for the week shift. Comparable store transaction count increased across all regions of the country and was driven by strength in our C.U.E. items.", "Both average comp ticket and big ticket sales were flat to prior year. Product resets and new assortment offerings helped sales of certain big ticket products such as chicken coops, generators and grills, but these sales were offset by softness in other seasonal categories. Outdoor power equipment sales were soft in the back half of the quarter, but cooler temperatures and greater moisture has extended the spring selling season, and we've seen an improvement in the outdoor power equipment category in the early part of third quarter.", "Deflation impacted average ticket by approximately 30 basis points. As a reminder, Petsense store sales are not reflected in same-store sales, as those stores will be included in the store base beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017.", "Now, turning to gross margin, which decreased 10 basis points to 34.9% compared to a 30-basis-point decrease in the prior year. Product margin was essentially flat to prior year with no significant impact from mix or rate. We were pleased with the merchandising team's ability to maintain gross margin rate with a balanced pricing approach that incorporates both market share and margin-driving strategies.", "Freight negatively impacted gross margin, principally due to a greater mix of freight-intensive categories, higher average fuel costs, and to a lesser extent, growth in our online business. Petsense provided a slight benefit to gross margin, as these stores operate at a higher rate than Tractor Supply stores.", "For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, deleveraged by 50 basis points to 22.1% of sales, compared to 21.6% of sales in the prior quarter. The SG&A growth principally reflects our investment in a few key strategic areas, a greater investment in store payroll hours as part of our focus on enhancing the customer experience, also, our investments in technology to grow our digital capabilities, and then, Petsense which operates at a higher SG&A rate.", "Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was 37.0% compared to 36.8% last year. The increase in the rate principally reflects lower state tax incentive credits compared to the prior year.", "Now, turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had a cash balance of $68 million and $454 million outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $151 million and $196 million in outstanding debt last year.", "During the second quarter, we acquired 2.2 million shares for $134 million through our stock repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have acquired a total of 3.8 million shares for $248 million.", "The consolidated average inventory per store decline of 6.5% reflects the impact of Petsense stores on the chain average. Exclusive of Petsense, average inventory levels per store increased 1.1% compared to a 1.2% decrease in last year's second quarter. We are pleased with the productivity of our inventory during the quarter, as well as the management of our working capital.", "Given the seasonal nature of some of our product categories, we evaluate our business based on the performance of the halves and not just the quarters. With this in mind, let me make a few brief comments on our first half performance.", "Consolidated net sales grew 7.9%, and we had positive comp sales of 0.2% for the first half versus an adjusted increase of 1.7% last year. Comparable store transaction count increased 0.5% for the first half compared to an adjusted 2.7% in the prior year. While sales and gross margin trends improved in the second quarter, our first half results were below our expectations, with the majority of the shortfall from the first quarter.", "Now, with respect to our outlook. Based on the trends and results of the first half of the year, we've revised our outlook for the full year fiscal 2017. We expect full year sales to range from $7.13 billion to $7.19 billion, comparable store sales to increase between 1.1% and 1.7% and net income to range from $413 million to $419 million and earnings per diluted share to be $3.22 to $3.27.", "Assumed in this guidance is an operating margin decline of 80 to 100 basis points, a tax rate of 36.7% to 36.9%, average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 128.2 million to 128.8 million and capital expenditures of $250 million to $270 million.", "We estimate deflation will impact full year same-store sales by approximately 30 basis points, which includes the second half forecast of approximately 20 basis points impact.", "Our revised comparable store sales outlook assumes a comp estimate of 2.0% to 3.0% in the second half of the year. Based on our Q2 trends and early third quarter momentum, we are keeping our comp store sales assumptions for the back half generally consistent with our original plan. As a reminder, the third quarter is cycling an adjusted negative 1.1% comparable store sales from the third quarter of last year and the fourth quarter is cycling a prior year positive 3.8% comparable store sales result. While our timing of new store openings is slightly behind our original forecast, we expect to hit our 100-store target and continue to be pleased with the new store productivity.", "For the year, we expect gross margin to be flat to slightly down due to the decline it experienced in the first half. Thus, we are estimating a slight improvement in gross margin during the back half.", "With respect to SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, we anticipate SG&A deleverage of approximately 80 to 100 basis points this year. Factors to consider are: first, higher payroll expense to drive strong customer service levels in our stores along with cycling favorable medical and workers' compensation related costs in the prior year are key contributors to the deleveraging of expenses in the back half of the year. Additionally, depreciation expense is expected to grow 16% to 17% over the prior year, resulting from our key strategic investments in technology, our LED lighting retrofit program and supply chain enhancements. Additionally, Petsense will have an unfavorable impact on SG&A leverage for the full year.", "Also, let remind you that the prior year's second half SG&A benefited from strong expense control, a reduction in incentive compensation, and favorable medical and workers' compensation expenses. Additionally, the 53rd week benefited last year's second half and full year expense leverage, and also added approximately $0.055 per diluted share. Our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 36.7% to 36.9%, as we do not expect to see tax benefit in the current year from the new accounting rules related to the recognition of the tax benefit on stock options exercised.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we will take our first question from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse.", "Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thanks a lot and good afternoon. And nice progress in the quarter.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thanks.", "Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "My question, Greg, is do you think we're at an inflection for the business? So you did a 2.2% this quarter, did 2.8% adjusted for Easter. You kept the guidance for the second half for 2% to 3%. The first half overall was basically flat though, and I know over time, you've taught us to look at the business in halves. So I'm just wondering can you give us a better sense of what you think is driving that improvement in the second half of the year. What gives you confidence in that? I know you talked about the moderation in some of the headwinds. If you can elaborate on that, I think it would be really helpful.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Seth, a couple of things. I think number one, we always talk about the halves, not the quarters and I look at the first quarter as an anomaly. I really did. I also would tell you that we're seeing some very positive signs that our consumers are back in our stores, our customer service levels have never been better and I think that our consumers, not only in stores, but even online are finding that we're in stock, we can take care of their needs, and now that they're out doing these projects and that we are the place that they're choosing to shop with. But I think what I should do is maybe throw this over to Steve and let him talk to you about a few things that he believes also he's seeing in the merchant marketing side.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Seth, this is Steve. I would tell you there's probably a handful of things, because we sit down and really analyze the business when we took a look at the forward-look here. And I would tell you that our Q2 sales trend give us a bit more confidence as we work our way into the year that things were starting to play out like we had intended originally. Greg mentioned that we're seeing a bit of an extended selling season on the spring product into July, which gives us a little bit of confidence. We've experienced a number of headwinds and we brought those up over the last 18 months and Greg addressed this in his initial comments, and we're certain to see a little bit of a moderation in some of those headwinds such as some of the oil impacted stores as well as deflation.", "And finally, I would go as far as to say that some of the initiatives that both Greg and Kurt spoke of, relative to the Neighbor's Club, Buy Online Pick Up in Store, and even some of the merchandising events that we've got plan for the back half, give us some degree of confidence that the things that we're doing are working. So that's why we kind of laid out what we did, that 2% to 3%.", "Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Matt McClintock of Barclays.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Yes. Good afternoon, everyone.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good afternoon.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. So I wanted to actually talk a little bit about digital and because you talked a little bit about that in your prepared remarks. And the one thing that I wanted to focus on was the evidence that the initiatives are contributing to the top-line results. Can you maybe help walk us through a little bit that in more detail, what evidence there is that you're seeing and why you have that level of confidence?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Matt, this is Steve. So we scaled Buy Online Pick Up in Store, I'll start there, across the entire chain. I think it was back in May. And those Buy Online Pick Up in Store sales represented just over 50% of our online business. And if you look at our direct-to-customer business, we continue to see very strong double-digit comps there as well.", "So when you tie the two together, we're feeling very good that our customer \u2013 we've always known that they've gone online for the content, and part of this One Tractor initiative is to make sure that we support them anytime, anywhere and anyway they want to work with us.", "Now, the store is really the epicenter of our transactional business. But this outside opportunity for customers to do the research and come online continues to grow. The unique customers coming to our site were up almost 29% from a year ago. And in addition to that, the store locator button that we have on the site was up almost 60% from a year ago. So we see the digital part of our business really enhancing the store experience. And so that's why I think we have some degree of confidence that our initiatives are paying off.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And then, if I may, one follow-up, just on Farmers Market, you talked about that at the Analyst Day and I was wondering now that we progress throughout the year a little bit, if you could talk a little bit about how is that performed as you roll that out to other stores in the chain?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well, we've got some great feedback when we did it this spring, and while the business was very strong during that window of time, it really wasn't about a one-day type of initiative. It's really about working in communities that our stores are located and making sure those folks in and around those communities feel like Tractor is a hub for them. And the feedback we've got from our store operators, guys, it was fantastic, but let's take a look at this in the back half of the year as well so that they have more opportunities to sell more unique and different things. For example, a lot of the harvest products that they may bring in from their gardens. So we see this partly as an opportunity to bring new people to Tractor Supply, but at the same time, we see this as an opportunity to really be part of the community that we serve.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley.", "Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, good afternoon, everyone. My first question is, I guess, a follow-up on the guidance. So the back half, I think Kurt mentioned 2% to 3% comps implied for the rest of the year. Yet, it looks like the margin profile of the business is a bit worse. The incrementals look weak. And Kurt mentioned a couple of items on the SG&A side. Is it just that that you have some of those tough compares? Or is the cost of the business going up a little from investments that you're making in the back half?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure, Seth (sic) [Simeon], this is Kurt. Couple of things in there as I mentioned on the gross margin side, there's a slightly less benefit in the back half than our original forecast was on the gross margin side. And then, on the expense side of it, there's the additional spend, as Greg mentioned, on the store payroll. We see a lot of strong feedback and benefit from great customer service in stores. So there's additional store investment on the back half as well. And then, you mentioned the third thing. The back half of the year has some strong compares in the 53rd week, as well as some of the cost savings and favorable benefit we got from certain insurance reserves, such as medical and workers' comp in the back half last year.", "Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, my follow-up you mentioned that in the back half, gross margin is expected to be, I think, you said flat or up a bit. Can you talk about what the risks, meaning if you don't get there, what are some of the culprits if gross margin isn't up in the back half of the year?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure. A couple of things on there, Seth (sic) [Simeon]. I'd say that the biggest factor on the gross margin side is that we do see freight headwinds persisting in the second half as we do in the first half. And then, the difference that we see on the gross margin side is that we do see some momentum from the gross margin improvement that we saw in second quarter and we anticipate that those trends will continue in the second half. And we see that those will be some of the tailwinds that we've got on it. The expense side are the things I just mentioned in the first part of your question.", "Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Peter Benedict of Robert Baird.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hey, guys. Just a follow-up on that question, so the momentum, Kurt, you just mentioned the momentum on gross margin in the second half. And the second quarter, I mean, it was down for the quarter a bit. Can you speak a little bit more to what is breaking right for you on the gross margin side that you think is going to hold that number up? Because if freight is still a bit of headwind, what's going to kind of carry the day on gross margin in the back half?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure, Peter. A couple of things. What we saw in the second quarter that was different is we did see a momentum change in the first part of the second quarter all the way to the backend strength in some of our pricing initiatives as well as the exclusive brands. Our assumptions for the back half, we see opportunity and growth on the gross margin with additional exclusive brand products and growth there, as well as continuing on the pricing side the momentum that we saw in the second quarter.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "And Peter, the only thing I would add to that \u2013 this is Steve \u2013 is that if you look at where we're at right now, Greg had mentioned a little bit of an extended selling season of spring product, we feel like we'll be in a really good position where we won't experience maybe deep markdowns. And we think that will benefit us here at least in the third quarter, as we go into Q4.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful, guys. And just on the CapEx, I know you kind of pulled that in a little bit, what's kind of coming out? And just can you give us a sense for when you think about the cash coming in and the leverage ratio of the business, how comfortable are you with where you're at in terms of leverage where you're comfortable taking that in the future? Thank you.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure. Peter, first on the CapEx, the most significant difference is the Northeast distribution center capital spend that was in the original plan. There was a decrease and that's the most significant factor on the CapEx and it's a timing issue. The timing of the spend has shifted out of 2017 into 2018. Most of the other parts of the spend are relatively consistent, maybe a slight reduction on new stores and slight reduction on IT.", "As far as the capital spend side, we look at the back half as operating cash flow fairly consistent with last year and I would anticipate our debt to be in the $500 million to $550 million range by the end of the year, and that's pretty consistent in line with our targets of a 2.0 leverage ratio.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets.", "Robert Iannarone - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, guys. This is Rob Iannarone on for Scott. Thanks for taking the call. As we think about the SG&A investments, as we're going to see in the second half here, should we view that as more of a one-time bump, because sales have been a bit on the slower side or should we assume you guys are going to invest more in labor to improve the customer service levels on more of a longer-term basis?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Robert, I'll take that. This is Greg. I would tell you that the results that we've seen from our efforts to bring what I would call our store themes, level of customer service back to levels that we're excited about and we've seen this through our SMG reporting, it's not a short-term thing. Although as we believe the sales will come with that investment, I think we'll be able to leverage some of that over time. So it's a little bit of a step-out, but it's also a step-up, I believe, in driving the sales.", "Robert Iannarone - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Thank you for that. And just one other, a little bit separate here. When you think about big ticket and average ticket, are you concerned at all there that those remained flat despite stronger seasonal trends?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, this is Steve. I think Kurt mentioned that where we fell short really was in some of the seasonal spring businesses, because we saw some pretty good movement in categories, like Kurt mentioned, chicken coops and grills, generators and a few other categories. They were just offset. What we did also say is that we saw a bit of an extended selling season and Greg had mentioned in his opening remarks, I think it was outdoor power equipment, so some of that maybe just delayed.", "Robert Iannarone - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Thanks for taking the questions, guys.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Alan Rifkin of BTIG.", "Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC", "Thank you very much. You talked about there being significant opportunities to grow the Petsense format. I'm wondering if maybe you could provide a little bit of color since it's almost a year under your belt as to how those unit economics compare with the legacy Tractor format.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Alan, this is Greg. I'll start off by telling you that it's not been a year, it's been about only six months. And what we're learning is that in these real markets, we have a niche of consumers there that is a little different than the Tractor consumer who needs high service, who needs maybe a little higher mix of what I'd call premium brand products that they can't find really anywhere else and they may find it in an individual mom and pop.", "So when we did our research on Petsense and the history that we had developed with our experience with HomeTown Pet, it clearly showed that there was at least 1,000 stores markets out there that we could place this concept. So it is very different than Tractor from a standpoint of its offering of services and even mix. It will be more bifurcated as we go forward. That particular organization, from a economic standpoint, a little higher SG&A but also higher margins because of the mix of the services piece.", "So we like the model. We like the way it's going to add, I think, incremental value to TSC over time. But it won't be the same ramp that you'll see in Tractor storage right now. We still have some more learning to do and, as I said, when we made the purchase, it's about a year's worth of learning before we can start to push the pedal down.", "Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC", "Okay. And one follow-up, if I may, Greg. On the Pets, you've talked about the relative low vulnerability of the Tractor Supply stores to e-comm. Now, you're talking about the greater connectivity that you're seeing between the stores and online as that strengthens. Net-net, do you think that there's a little bit more vulnerability to e-comm than online today than what you saw even one or two years ago? And if so, what incremental changes are you going to make going forward for the anticipated accelerated growth online?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "What I would tell you is this and I think Steve will probably join here as well is I don't use the word vulnerability. I would use that the consumers' purchasing patterns and interest and how they engage with us is changing. And there are some products in our stores that are virtually impossible to sell online and be able to move to a consumer in a way that makes any sense or any money.", "But secondly, you can't underestimate the importance of having that store and that availability of the online component where the customer can research, engage with us as a brand and make the decision, because they're in control. They make the decision if they want to shop the store, if they want to buy directly online, have it shipped to them, that's an element that I don't think we understood until we turned on Buy Online Pick Up in Store how powerful that was.", "And what's amazing to us is the amount of our customers that like to still come to our store. They buy online but they choose to make the pickup in our store. It's a very high percentage in comparison to most, I'll call it, other retailers that have both sides of the business.", "So Steve, anything you want to say?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, the only thing I would say is it's still a relatively small percent of our total revenue. I mean, this year, I believe between Buy Online Pick Up in Store and what we're going to do in direct sales, it's good to be between 1% and 2% of our total overall revenue. So it's still relatively small. It is a convenience for our customer and I think we've always had good traffic to our site and I think the investments that both Greg and Kurt talked about with IT are going to help us in the future.", "So your next question, I believe you ask is what are you going to do as your customer continues to evolve, and I will tell you there's a number of capabilities that, right now, we're working on or have actually put into play that's enhancing that experience. For example, we've got e-gift card, which we just rolled out, expanded offerings. We're working on enhanced search. By the end of the year, we should have subscription up and running, which I think will be a great offering to our customers. And whether they take advantage of that or not, we'll have to find out, but we believe that's a real benefit to them.", "And of course, stockyard and special orders, so there's a lot of things that I think we're doing to evolve with our customers' needs and that's of no surprise. So we've been working on this for years and I think right now, we're really getting a much better understanding of how to best accommodate those customers.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good evening, guys.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good evening.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So I wanted to follow up just as you're thinking about the back half. I know you do some work in the planning process around the weather, and that really hasn't cooperated with you at least in the fall the past couple of years. So what are you expecting in terms of the fall heating season, and then, as you get into December and lap that cold snowy month from December last year, how are you paced or positioned against the weather?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. Christopher, this is Kurt, I'll start and I'll just say that our assumptions baked into our revised guidance for the back half assumes more normalized weather there. I'll just start with that, in that, last year, we had a slow start to the fall winter season and sluggish September as well as October, November, we're soft, and then, as you referred to the December. We see a more normalized year between Q3 and Q4 as the main factor that we baked into our guidance.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. And I would just say to add on to that a little bit, Christopher, that it was a slow ramp this last year. We did have a nice December. The team's working around other initiatives that we can put into place to offset some of that vulnerability, if you want to call it that, but a lot of the resets that we're working on and things within the store are really C.U.E. based and C.U.E. focused. So while that will always be a factor, we're trying to lessen the impact.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I got it. And I know it's a little early, but a lot has happened over the past two years. And so, as you look out beyond the back half, how do you think about the pace of store opens? Is 100 the right number for the year? And then, thinking about the investment pressures, I know some of it is one-off items cycling in the back half, but does the investment cycle extend into 2018 and does that sort of push the leverage point to the upper end or even further on the 2%, 3% comp algo?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure. Christopher, it's Kurt. First, on the new stores, as I mentioned, we're excited about new store productivity. Our new stores are continuing to be part of our growth strategy, in that, they're driving the comp sales as well as the bottom line profit. Our new stores typically are profitable in year one. So yes, we see in 2018 and beyond where our targets of approximately 100 stores, it's a good fit for our internal resource structure. We can grow those 100 stores with a lot of the existing support and good opportunity for Tractor Supply out there.", "Other investments, we anticipate our capital spend would be somewhat consistent in the near future years to what you're seeing in 2017. And I would say yes, the investments on the technology side, logistic supply chain to drive and support our key initiatives, we're expecting those in the near term as well. But we'll be cycling that type of level as that investment is baked into the operating margin today. But yes, we've got years where we're going to continue to drive support on the digital and the logistics side.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens, Inc.", "Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to \u2013 you made a comment about your customers, you're seeing evidence of your customers coming back into your stores. I'm curious, are you seeing customers shopping parts of the stores that maybe they weren't over the last year or are they just broadly coming in and shopping the store when they may not have even been in the store over the course of the last year-and-a-half or so?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Hey, Ben, this is Greg. One of the things that we've seen through the additional layers of, I'll call it, customer service we've been able to give our customers is a more satisfied customer who seems to be shopping across more categories. Now, that being said, we have a little bit more favorable weather here as we kind of ended the quarter. And I would tell you that we've seen no slowdown in our C.U.E. business and the consumable side of our business that keeps driving it. As we add more and more product categories there and as Steve and the merchant team continue to break things out there, we're finding that we saw our transaction counts move back up, average size of our transactions holding even without, okay, having some of that big ticket tailwind that we'd like to see.", "So all these things are good, positive signs that our customers are still with us, still shopping with us, still choosing us over others, and we're encouraged as we go into the third quarter and the second half that will continue.", "Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay, great. And then on the e-commerce side, you noted some of the traction that you've achieved there with the enhancements you've made. I'm curious, what particular categories are you seeing selling at a faster rate online? And as you're seeing customers transition to online purchases, where's that velocity highest and which product categories?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "I think that's a question Steve and I will both answer. First of all, we don't talk in specific categories, but they buy across a broad base. There's no one specific category. We've done some things with some pre-shipping offers and minimum purchase offers that have played out very, very well for us in both the pet categories and some other categories. But I would tell you, it's not so much a transition as it is giving the option to our consumers. As I've said before, the Buy Online Pick Up in Store component is incredibly strong and it gives us great confidence that our customers still like shopping our stores. Yes, on some things, they will choose maybe to ship it direct, but I would tell you, it's a combination of both and it's giving them choice. That's what matters.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "The only thing I would add is that the business that we are doing online, a lot of that business are through products that we don't even carry within the four walls of the building. So they may be special order products that are larger sizes. It could be vendors that we've set up that ship direct to customer, dropship. So a lot of that business isn't necessarily business that you would find within the four walls, but it really has \u2013 it indexes pretty high in terms of categories we don't have within the four walls.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Steve Forbes of Guggenheim Securities.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Good afternoon.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good afternoon.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "You gave some color on Neighbor's Club. But can you expand on what you're seeing that would indicate that you're gaining share of wallet with your 4 million members or maybe a target group of those members? Just really trying to understand how the customer evolves as a member, whether it be their shopping patterns, how they build a relationship with your store associates. I mean, how do they evolve with the brand as they mature as a member? And then, just quickly on that, as a follow-up, are they generally satisfied with the reward they're getting, right, the seasonal reward, or is that still evolving?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Steve, this is Steve. Great questions. I was just travelling this last week up to Pennsylvania and had a chance to visit a lot of our stores and talk to some of our customers that are part of the program. And generally speaking, it's gone over very well.", "Now, if you look at our growth in this, we're still relatively immature. I mean, we haven't fully cycled year-over-year all stores scaled. So what I can tell you is, let me give you a few tidbits. Greg mentioned that those stores who have a higher index of transactions of members are performing at a higher rate on a comparable store basis.", "Another slice of data that I would give you is that I asked the team to go back and look at those customers that started with us and enrolled in October through December of 2015. So it was right when we started the program. And I asked what their purchase history looked like in the first half of 2016 versus the first half of 2017. And you can see an increase in transactions of those same existing customers within the box itself. So that leads us down a path that we can definitely tell that by working toward a reward and getting reminders, it is bringing people in more often.", "The last thing I would say is how do we feel about the offers that we're giving. The feedback so far has been \u2013 we've tried a variety of different things. We're still testing and learning here. But I can tell you that the opt out rate of people that are part of the program is incredibly tiny. So people still want to be engaged. They still want to be involved. And we still think that this is a big opportunity as we mature into this.", "We're collecting a lot of data. The next step for us is getting tools to mine it better and then to even personalize those messages more so than we're doing today.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "And then, maybe just a quick follow-up on that point. Can you just remind us what data you are gathering from those members, whether it's e-mails, phone numbers, demographic data, I mean, what information are you gathering?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. So what we do is we ask for phone and we ask for e-mail and then we give them a profile page if they'd like to fill it out and opt in there. So we've got some key data, and that data also, we also collect data if you're not a Neighbor's Club member through reverse of pen (49:07) and getting phone and ZIP capture there. So our attribution rate has continued to grow. And it allows us to really dig deep into what that customer's experience is. And we're also able to tie that back into their experience online and we'll have more information for you guys in the future on that.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Michael Lasser of UBS.", "Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC", "Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Hi, Michael.", "Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, Greg. Your traffic improved from down 1.4% in the first quarter to up 2.2% in the second quarter. You continued to say that C.U.E. was a leading factor in driving the traffic. So did C.U.E. get better from 1Q to 2Q to drive the traffic improvement or was it some other factor that contributed to the improvement?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Michael, this is Steve. First off, don't forget that extra day that we lost.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Right.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "So I want to keep reminding everyone of that...", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, we lost a day.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "...because one day in a quarter does represent a pretty big portion of the total. So while we did have a reported 2.2%, I believe there was about 60 basis points there and that would have driven up the transaction count higher than what you originally stated.", "Our C.U.E. business does continue to grow. And as \u2013 I think it was Greg mentioned in his remarks or Kurt, the animal and pet area continues to be a portion of that C.U.E. business that we saw that growth and so we recognized we're a dependable needs supplier and that continues to work well for us.", "Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC", "But I guess what drove the improvement in the traffic from the first quarter to the second quarter?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well, in first quarter, and again, if you go back and look at the months, January was a really tough month for us and a lot of that was weather related. And so, just year-over-year comparable was a very difficult this last year and it wasn't on the animal side of the business that we struggled, it was more on the seasonal side of the business.", "Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC", "And my follow-up question is on the e-comm growth. It sounds like you're seeing some bigger ticket trends online than you are in the stores. Does it just validate that maybe the consumer wants to buy some of the bigger ticket products online and get free shipping, because when they pick it up in store it is free?", "And does that suggest anything about what you might have to do over the long run and maybe where you're losing some of the traffic to, by virtue of what you're seeing in your particular e-commerce business?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Michael, this is Steve. I don't know if I fully follow that train of thought, because most of the traffic that is driven in our stores is in smaller ticket products, as you can imagine, it's not in big ticket merchandise. While there is a benefit of going online and doing a lot of research, the majority of what we sell in big ticket is done within the four walls and not done online and I think most retailers would tell you that as well. So I don't know if it's necessarily a gap or anything. I think we continue to see growth, as Greg said, across the board on e-comm, including a lot of products we don't even sell in our stores but we get dropship.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer.", "Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Hi, Brian.", "Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer", "So a question I have on the comps, so it's very nice to see the bounce back from Q1 to Q2, and then, essentially, no changes to the back half guidance for 2% to 3%. You mentioned earlier, because some of these headwinds we've been talking about for a while may be going away, but the question I have is how should we think about \u2013 I mean what should the underlying \u2013 what should the company be comping normalized? I know this is a difficult question, but if we \u2013 I assume it's higher than 2% to 3%?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "I have to get out my black in my eight ball and kind of turn it around and ask you that question, Brian. But I would tell you that we've always said a 3% to 5% in that range was where we would target, okay, as a comp, and probably high single, if you add new stores in total company. So our feeling about Q2, it was moving more toward the normal of where I would consider we need to be. If you take the extra day and put it back in, it's 2.8%, pretty close to 3%, so we're saying we're getting more back to that normal, what I would call between 3% to 5%.", "Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Then, so I guess a follow-up to that, what headwinds are still out there then that are keeping you out of that 3% to 5% even though you've gotten closer to the lower end of it?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Michael (sic) [Brian], this is Kurt. I mean a couple of things and we've talked about these, but we've not seen the return of the tailwinds on the inflation. So at this point, as I mentioned, the back half of 2017 we anticipate continued deflation. Those years where you saw the benefit of the inflation, we don't have those yet and we don't have signs that those return in 2018 at this point.", "The oil markets have stabilized, moderated a bit, and so that's a positive in regards to how Texas, Oklahoma, are performing. But we're not at a point where those type of conditions are tailwinds for us. So those would be some things that we certainly would be looking for to get to a higher comp rate.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray.", "Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Hi, Peter.", "Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "I've got a couple of \u2013 two questions just on e-commerce. So Greg, you've mentioned you guys have extended some free shipping offers, minimum shipping offers with pet food and we saw a pickup with the footwear in the quarter. Are you seeing any uptick in those specific categories that make you rethink your current shipping offers are maybe getting a bit more aggressive on the e-commerce offer?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well, we tried several price tiers. We tried free, we tried $29 minimum and we tried $49 minimum. And let me assure you that our customer had really very little difference between $29 and $49, so we gravitated back to the $49 level, that seems to be working just fine and we're seeing growth.", "We're very selective on what we do on the free side, particularly if we can gear it more toward our own brands where there is a much richer margin and that's something that Steve and his team have been working through. But I think as you'll note, the mix of our business is still coming so heavily through Buy Online Pick Up in Store is a tremendous advantage for us. That continues to show you that because of our stores' proximity to where our customers live and the fact that they're probably on their way by our store, toward our store to do other shopping, they still choose to make that trip, and I don't believe that's going to change. So I think it's a combination of both that works. We don't always have to give free ship. We can do it with a respectable minimum and our customers seem to respond.", "Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Okay, great. That's actually a nice segue to my next question is that Buy Online Pick Up in Store. So it ramped very quickly here. I guess, do you feel like you might be leaving some sales on the table as a result of out of stocks? I know I think in the past, you mentioned that some of the orders from Buy Online Pickup in Store can be rather large. And furthermore, as Buy Online Pick Up service presumably gets bigger, should that have any impact on overall margin?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. Peter, this is Steve. No, I'll start with the second question first. If anything, the margin impact is a plus, because people are coming in to pick it up rather than having it shipped to their place. So from that perspective, we don't see any negative impact overall on the margin side of things.", "On Buy Online Pick Up in Store, in general, I mean, our in stocks year-over-year are better than they were a year ago. We made some key investments in some of the categories that were under $20 that we felt would benefit us overall and we were able to do that with very little total inventory investment. As you heard Kurt say, I think we were over about 1% for the quarter.", "In terms of our concern about losing business, I actually think that this is probably benefiting us in the long haul. And so that's not an overall concern at this point.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Thanks a lot and good afternoon.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Afternoon (58:04), Seth.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "My question is around the promotion and pricing environment. Can you give us a little bit more color year-over-year on where the promotional intensity was and where you saw opportunities to take price or invest in price?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. So this is Steve. I think relatively speaking, our promotional cadence was pretty similar. I think we did have an ad roll into the second quarter that we didn't have in Q1. But outside of that, there was nothing really material or substantial during the quarter that would have had any real impact. And as we look forward, we don't see any significant changes in what we intend to do either when it comes to promotion.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "That's helpful. And as it relates to pricing specifically, I think you talked about...", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, yeah.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "...the opportunities that helped your margin a little bit. Can you give us a little bit more color category wise where those were...", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "...and yeah, that would be great.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good question. So one of the benefits of having invested in a pricing tool years ago was it allows us to look at elasticity across all categories. And we really took advantage of that system during the quarter and looked at the four walls and looked at the different regions of the country. I mean, this wasn't a one stroke brush across the entire chain. So it was very scientific in what we did. The impact on elasticity, we didn't show a whole lot of negative impact as far as losing share and gaining rate. So based on some of the learning and the testing that we did, we rolled it out to more stores. And I think that's some of the lift that we experienced toward the back end of the quarter.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Great. And we anticipate that continuing through the back half of the year, right?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, I think that's what gives us a little bit more confidence in talking about the stabilization, as Kurt mentioned, toward the back half and not maybe what we experienced in Q1.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to dive into a little bit the longer term margin profile of the company on how we should frame it. I know you guys talked a little bit about kind of a step-up in SG&A spend, we're also shifting the business a little bit more to e-commerce. Buy Online Pick Up in Store is good, 55%, but you have the other side. And then, also, with the stuff that's available widely online and a lot of your stuff isn't, there does seem to still be some price discrepancy where you're priced a little bit higher. So I was wondering, as you guys frame it, how should we think of margins kind of as we go forward and shift your business on a longer term basis? Is it just going to be a natural pressure on the business on the margin side?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure, Scott, this is Kurt. I would start with saying that we don't get too far into beyond the current year, maybe a little bit the near term. I would tell you that for the near term that we would expect the investments that we referred to as on the expense side, to have some of those continue to exist. On the gross margin side of the product, we continue to balance the different levers that we've got on rate, mix and driving market share. So I'd say the short-term, there's pretty much consistency between 2017 and, say, 2018. Beyond that, I think it's too far out reaching to try to give additional guidance at this point.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "And the only thing I would add to that, Scott, is that we have a list of opportunities in terms of margin improvement that we can take advantage of and I think about a third of our business was in exclusive brands or private brands and sales that we did in the second quarter. We still see more upside, more opportunity there. We've just recently added to our team in strategic sourcing and we believe that there's more opportunity to lower cost there.", "And then, finally, as we grow as an organization, my challenge back to the merchandising team is that we should be able to leverage our position, in a lot of cases with the branded folks out there today, to really be able to lower our overall costs. So there are a number of things I think we can do that could offset any of the potential headwinds that you mentioned.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "And as a follow-up to what you guys said \u2013 I appreciate the detail \u2013 is when you look at like some of the C.U.E. products, some of the clothing that's \u2013 the branded items that are available in multiple channels, a lot online, where do you think you're priced and do you think you need to make some investments there? And that's my follow-up. I appreciate it.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Scott, this is Steve. What I would tell you is that we look at pricing all the time, whether it be in brick-and-mortar competitors or what we're seeing online. And we've got categories of merchandise that we stand for that, quite frankly, we've got to make sure in those categories and in those items that we're very competitive. And so, we use our pricing tools and dynamic pricing to make sure that we're managing that accordingly.", "So what I would tell you is this, are we going to be the best price on 15,000 SKUs inside our box every single day against every single competitor online? Probably not. Where we're going to stand for something, we will be priced right.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Dan Wewer of Raymond James.", "Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thanks. I try to as a follow-up on a few of the questions, thinking about the operating margin outlook, back in February at the investors meeting, we were looking for 20-basis-point to 30-basis-point annual improvement. But is it fair to say that given the investments that are going to continue that 2018 that we probably should not expect any kind of meaningful improvement until 2019?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Dan, this is Kurt. I would tell you that some of the investments that we talked about in 2017 that will exist in 2018. Near term, operating margin may be more flat and you're close on, if we're reaching out and looking ahead, it would be at least 2019 perhaps to start to see some operating margin growth. But even that far out, it's hard to \u2013 and don't want to try to give any sort of guidance beyond that.", "Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Do you think that the thesis for Tractor Supply is more of a top-line story, going forward, in that future cost of goods sold savings would probably have to be shared with the customer in an effort to grow market share?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Great question, Dan. I think there's couple angles to that. One is that we continue to share today with our customer the benefits of our size and scale. And our pricing, generally on most of the products we have in our store are priced right every day, as you know, we're not a high-low retailer.", "The second thing is on the share basis, in certain categories of businesses where Steve and the team have really built a strong substantial base of our own brands, we continue to see more and more growth there. Those should over time continue to add to some margin improvement, but you talked about the sharing, we'll probably give some of that back, when we look at some of the things we'll be doing with probably the direct-to-customer side of the business.", "I seriously do not believe that that direct-to-customer business will ever outweigh the Buy Online Pick Up side of the business. I said this earlier in my remarks that ours is the store that our team members and our customers have this bond and this relationship where they like to come in our stores and shop. They like to talk to our team members for that seasoned advice. And so, we see that through when we turned on Buy Online Pick Up in Store.", "So we're going to share back with the consumer to make sure that they're getting a good value for their money. But I don't think that we have to go out and \u2013 we always use this terminology, do you own your customer or do you rent your customer. We like to own our customers through giving them great values, great service, being in stock and being available to them, whether we're close to them with a physical store or being available to them 24/7 online. That's how we believe we'll win.", "Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then, just one real quick question. On the same-store sales performance, we're measuring that two different ways in the quarter, right? One is on the calendar you have this year and one is adjusted so that the weeks match up the same and the prior years. Inside your company, do you believe that your same-store sales are up 1% or 2.2%? When you're evaluating results, which metric did you use?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Dan, this is Kurt. So I think I understand the question. Just maybe clarify the reference to 1% versus 2.2%. Is the 1% you're referring to last year?", "Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Maybe \u2013 so there was a week difference in the calendar, right, year-over-year?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Right, right, right. Yes, so...", "Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "So which calendar do you use internally in evaluating your performance?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Got you. We use the 1.1% last year as the base up against that 2.2% reported number.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yes.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "In looking at the spring seasonal strength you're seeing so far extending into the third quarter, can you talk about how broad that is? Is it just outdoor power equipment? Is it some of the consumables stuff? And with that strength, why aren't you a little more positive on the comps in the third quarter and second half? Is there an offset going on?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Chuck, first of all, this is Steve. I would tell you that the season has extended in a lot of the spring seasonal product. We feel that there is some momentum here that's building. But we also want to be reasonable in terms of what our comp guidance and future forecasts looks like. And so, over the course of the time I've been with Tractor, we've laid out plans and we've always worked hard to achieve those. And I think the work that Kurt and his team have done, as we look forward, is a reasonable comparable store sales target.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Are there any tougher categories that are sort of offsetting the stronger ones that are extending?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well, what I would say is that the spring seasonal business becomes less of a total part of our business as the quarter continues. September is a five-week fiscal quarter for us, and we certainly don't get a whole lot of spring seasonal business then. So while we've got a little bit of traction now, it's hard for us to gauge what August and September are going to look like.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Got it. And how about \u2013 I'll finish with this question, how about competitive promotional activity? How would you gauge that in the current economic environment?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Again, this is Steve. I would tell you, I don't see a whole lot of change in brick-and-mortar. Our existing competitors, we try to keep an eye on that, and I haven't seen a whole lot there. I think online is always a different story and there's so many different categories that so many different people are in. We try to keep an eye on that, but that's ever-changing and it's incredibly dynamic. So I wouldn't want to make a standard blanket comment on that other than that it continues to change and we continue to keep an eye on it and make sure that we're doing what we need to do not to lose share.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from David Magee of SunTrust.", "David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Yes. Hi, everybody.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Hi, Dave.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Hi, Dave.", "David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Just a quick one from me. I'm thinking about the store format over the next 12, 18 months, and you mentioned earlier resets continuing in the store and I'm curious what departments might get the most attention, big ticket, apparel, whatever it might be. Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Kurt, you want to take that?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "He's talking about store sets. He wants to know what store sets. David, clarify the question. You're asking what are some of the department store sets that are going to be some things driving the business as we go forward?", "David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Yeah, as you look around the store, what areas, when you mention resets, get the most attention?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Okay. Got it.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "I apologize for that, David. Well, first of all, I would tell you that the box has really evolved over the course of the time that I've certainly been with it. And it's evolved over the last five to 10 years as well. And we've talked a lot about the C.U.E. business continuing to drive the overall transactions and traffic.", "We're going to continue to put the pedal down there. We believe there's more upside in what we're doing in a lot of the C.U.E. businesses. So in the back half, for example, we're going to go back and revisit our pet business. There's some sub-brands out there that we believe will continue to add growth. In feed, we know that there's more of a regional play that we can get into there. We're going to be looking at our oil and lubricant categories as they continue to grow.", "And over time, we're going to have to look at the totality of the box. Now, it will probably be the same size as it is today, but we're going to revisit the space allocation that we give to certain categories and as time change and as business change, there may be some categories that would be better off at special order and we can improve the level of productivity of the inventory and drive our overall turnover up. So right now, the team is working diligently on this and we'll probably have more to share on the next conference call.", "David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, Steve.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Adam Sindler of Deutsche Bank.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yes, good afternoon, everyone. How you doing?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Good. So I just want to talk a little bit about expenses as well. It looks like D&A was up quite a bit in the quarter, maybe about 21% in dollars. Is that simply due to some of the online initiatives that you're working on, investing in software and things of that nature? And if so, should we expect that to continue throughout the year? And then, looking out a little bit, should we continue to expect SG&A total operating expense dollars to grow in the sort of 9% range?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure, Adam, this is Kurt. First, let me \u2013 I'll address the depreciation question. Depreciation grew in the first half about 19%. And as we look ahead, I think the key thing is there's a distinct difference in regards to cycling or not cycling yet Petsense. So you've got growth in that number in Petsense included this year and not. And when you factor that out, the gap is a little bit different. We're estimating about a 16%, 17% growth rate in depreciation for the year, and we'll start to cycle Petsense in the fourth quarter.", "And so, the second half of the year will have a little bit more investment that half last year than the first half. So the compares are a little bit closer. So you'll probably be at about a 15% to 16% depreciation growth rate in the second half of the year. Biggest difference in the comparables is really the Petsense with, yes, some additional investment in our strategic initiatives. But the size of that, the gap, is not an indicator of the impact of the initiatives that we're talking about. They're driving 200 or 300 basis points maybe in growth rate of depreciation in the year. And we'll see the growth rate next year probably in the high single-digit range, a little bit ahead of the sales growth rate, but we'll continue to manage the levers that we've got to address the spend in there and keep the growth rate as close in line to the sales growth as possible.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "That's total operating expense dollars you're referring to there, correct?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yes.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then just real quickly to follow up, average order value on the Buy Online Pick Up in Store you said was favorable. Is that due to just a different mix of product, more items per basket? What's driving the delta there?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, a lot of it is mix. We added a lot of different categories this past year and we saw the benefit of doing so.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So a lot (01:15:52) about the calendar shifts. And I think last quarter you had said you expected about $15 million of seasonal sales to shift into 2Q. I'm wondering how that played out. And I realize you're also cycling what I think you had sized as about a $25 million weather related shift to the second quarter of last year. But was the $15 million pretty much in line?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Stephen, this is Kurt. I just want to reiterate, we did not emphasize a seasonal shift from first quarter to second quarter. We indicated at the end of first quarter that we certainly saw softness in demand in the seasonal product, and there was about $15 million of variance perhaps in March year-over-year. We did not see enough indication in regards to timing that we were indicating in anything that there was a seasonal shift.", "I would say the only shift might be the timing of Easter, and what we expected from pre-Easter in prior year first quarter to second quarter shifted pretty consistently, but that was in our plan.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just in terms of thinking through potentially the extension of the spring selling season into 3Q, are you able to put some numbers around that how meaningful you think that could be?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "No. At this moment, it wouldn't be accurate for me to get into that. I mean, until we get through the entire season, we won't really have a good read on it.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. That's fine. Just lastly, just higher level, I was wondering if you could comment on kind of the health of your consumer and how that's maybe being factored into your outlook, what you're seeing in their spending habits, et cetera.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "This is Greg. What I can tell you, and I was also in stores quite a bit this quarter, particularly I was down in the Texas markets, and that consumer base, I think, feels and believes that the economy there is stabilizing, so their spend levels are starting to come back. I think in general our consumer is feeling as if business may be as normal for right now.", "I do believe that some of the first quarter issue could have been that the fact that we came out of an election and people were waiting just to see what was going to happen, if anything. And I think once we got through that cycle, second quarter needs surfaced and people came back out and shopped. So we don't see any big change in how our tender is coming through. I like the footsteps. I like the fact that we were able to maintain our business in big ticket. So I feel good that the consumer is feeling comfortable right now. Hopefully, nothing else in Washington can sway them the other direction.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "All right. Thanks a lot, Greg. Good luck in the back half.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good afternoon.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good afternoon.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good afternoon.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "A housekeeping question and then a bigger picture question. From a housekeeping standpoint, I'm trying to just make sense of what sounds like a strong second quarter and a good second half, with the magnitude of the earnings reduction relative to 90 days ago. Can you just square those two points, please?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. Sure. When we baked in assumptions and looked at the first half and created the guidance for the year adjustments on our guidance, as we mentioned, top-line comp sales fairly consistent. There is some reduced new store sales due to the timing of the opening of new stores.", "But when you see on the expense side, a couple key things in regards to the back half. We certainly benefit from expense reduction and some favorable items last year. Do factor in the 53rd week as I mentioned. And we have more cautiousness in the revised guidance on gross margin rate versus the 20-basis-point to 30-basis-point improvement in the original guidance.", "There are \u2013 additionally on the tax rate, I've mentioned in my prepared remarks that the tax rate has increased 50 basis points. I do want to point that out that we do not expect to get the 50-basis-point benefit that we had in the original plan, due to the lack of stock option activity. So when you factor those results in as well as the trends on SG&A in the first half, I think you can get more to the 80-basis-point to 100-basis-point deleverage on SG&A in the back half for the year.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "The sales guidance in 2Q, were sales where you thought it's going to be or have you expected a better sales result? I mean, the numbers sounds good, but (01:20:51).", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Eric, if I could ask you to repeat that. It was fading out and I did not get much of the question. This is Kurt.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Sure. Yeah, just the reduction in the sales guidance today versus 90 days ago, it seems like 2Q and the second half were where you thought they were going to be. So just trying to square those two.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Okay. Sure, this is Kurt. I would just tell you without a lot of specifics, while the first half missed on both the top-line and bottom line, most of that was in the first quarter, but I would also say that second quarter, the top-line sales results while good, there was also both top and bottom line slight miss on the second quarter as well.", "And then, I do want to remind you with the \u2013 there are non-comp new store selling weeks that were baked into our original guidance that we had to adjust based on timing of new stores.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "And then, from a big picture standpoint, I'm interested in (01:21:50) the opportunity in C.U.E. and execution in C.U.E. has been great for the company historically. But looking out with an evolving consumer, is it your expectation more of that will move online and will be bought online and picked up at Tractor Supply or how do you view the C.U.E. evolution with your customer and how the stores where online would fit into that?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Great question, Eric. And we are looking at a number of things. Not only polling our customers as to their expectations, but doing some testing here in the next 6 to 12 months with some delivery formats from store, from third party, from our own distribution hubs to understand if we make certain things available online, first of all, can we drive higher levels of volume and gain more share and, secondly, what would the cost be. So you're going to see us doing some testing over time. It's not complete yet, but we'll have a better picture in the next 6 to 7 to 12 months.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group.", "Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of follow-ups from some of the other commentary. So I guess I understand on the expense side of things, like, some of what you've outlined. But what would you say is, again, I guess incrementally different? Is it the fact that you're spending a little more on labor for the second half than you anticipated in the first half of the year to service people or is it you're accelerating some e-commerce investment that's driving that SG&A level a little bit higher? I'm just trying to get a better sense of it.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure, Joe, this is Kurt. First, we can walk you through the adjustments from our original plan. I would tell you that the key factors, again, are the gross margin rate is softer than the original plan while a slight benefit. On the expense side, yes, we are going to invest on the second half additional payroll. The incentive comp is a strong headwind to go up against. We called it out last year that incentive comp was a benefit, and then, after that, it's just some of the other expense management that we had. Those are the items that differ between the original 60 basis points to 80 basis points deleverage on SG&A to more of an 80 basis points to 100 basis points.", "Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Got it. That's helpful. Thank you so much. And then, the other on, wanted to ask again on the big ticket items. I understand you're shifting a little bit more online. But the big ticket has been relatively soft for the past year or so and I'm wondering it seems like we've had several quarters of unfavorable weather that's kind of gone against you, maybe snow blowers not selling because there was too mild in winter and things like that. But how much, if you could bucket it, would be weather versus demand versus maybe even just competition, like, do you see share loss in any of those categories?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. This is Steve. I think it's a good question. I mean we look at the business in a lot of different ways and we had some pretty significant benefits or tailwinds over the course of time and I'll use for example safes. I'll use log splitters which is a great business for Tractor because of the customer base that we serve, maybe less of an extent of snow blowers, just because it's a smaller part of our total business. But there are some seasonal impacts to a lot of the big ticket things that we talked about. We've done a lot of things to offset some of that. We brought in new lineup of trailers. We have modified what we've done in reset categories such as pressure washers and generators, and we've seen the benefit of those things and that's helped offset what have been actually a bit more pain for us.", "So at the end of the day, I don't know if it's a matter of losing share necessarily and it's just more of a matter of, quite frankly, some of the weather impacts that we've had and some of the tailwinds that we experienced for quite a window of time.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Greg for any additional or closing remarks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Okay. Thank you, operator. Great questions today. We thank all of you for your continued support of Tractor Supply and Petsense.

Greg, please go ahead.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and CFO; Steve Barbarick, our EVP of Merchandising and Marketing; and Lee Downing, our EVP of Store Operations and Real Estate.", "We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and our full year results. Comp store sales for the quarter increased 5.3% versus an increase of 3.5% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The comp increase was driven by increases in both traffic and ticket, and we continued to see strength across all our major merchandize categories and geographic regions.", "The fourth quarter was our 21st consecutive quarter of positive comp store sales and our 27th consecutive quarter of positive comp transaction counts. For the fourth quarter, we made early strategic investments in a number of key categories such as heating, cold weather apparel and footwear and outdoor power equipment anticipating that the customer would purchase earlier than the year before.", "These investments positioned us well to capitalize on early consumer buying trends, driven by colder weather early in the quarter. We also strengthened our commitment to seasonal C.U.E. items and achieved a solid performance within this group of products, which also added to our comparable sales for the quarter.", "In the quarter, we started the rollout of our new demand planning system to the first few departments, and as we methodically rolled the system out across all our merchandize categories, this system will more accurately forecast the sales and seasonality of products that we carry within our assortments.", "During the fourth quarter, we also opened our first Tractor Supply store in Utah, which was the 49th state for Tractor Supply. We also converted our first Del\u2019s store over to the Tractor Supply format and nameplate in the state of Washington. We are excited about the opportunity to grow our market share in Washington as we continue to convert the remaining Del\u2019s stores to new TSC stores in that market.", "We continue to develop our omni-channel with improvements to content and product availability online as well as additions to our drop ship vendor ecommerce programs. We\u2019ve seen double-digit growth in visits to our Web site now that we\u2019ve added our mobile site capability, and although online sales are not material at this point, we have seen a significant increase in the store locator feature and believe our online and mobile sites are driving footsteps into our stores.", "Now regarding our supply chain. We purchased land and have started construction on our new distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona. This distribution center is an important part of our Western expansion strategy. Not only will it support our continued growth in those markets, it should lower our transportation costs and improve delivery times to our stores in that region. The new facility is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2015 and will have the potential to ultimately serve in upwards of 250 stores in the Southwest region.", "In 2015, we also plan to open two mixing centers in our Texas region. These are smaller cross-docking style distribution facilities that handle many of our palletized products and faster turning C.U.E. items such as [feed] [ph], shavings and wood pellets. With our vendors delivering products directly to these mixing centers, which are located closer to our stores, we can shorten our supply chain stem miles and reduce in-store inventory levels through more frequent store deliveries.", "As we move into 2015, we will continue to invest in the analytic tools and supply chain assets necessary to strategically drive our growth. Our priorities in 2015 include opening approximately 110 to 115 new Tractor Supply stores, opening our new Southwest distribution center and Northeast D.C. expansion, the addition of two mixing centers in our Texas region, continued growth in the state of Washington through our Del\u2019s conversion to Tractor Supply stores, system enhancements to increase scalability and analytic capability for inventory allocation, omni-channel engagement and CRM, and continued system security enhancements.", "As we all know, the cold harsh start to the year and the late spring selling season required us to carefully manage seasonal inventory investments and monitor our product sell-throughs. We had to react swiftly and we\u2019re successful in meeting the seasonal and everyday needs of our customers in both the first and second halves of the year. Throughout the year, the team did an excellent job of managing product flow and adjusting merchandize assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demands in the markets that we serve. We believe this continues to be a core competency and strategic advantage for Tractor Supply Company.", "In my closing comments, I\u2019d just like to say thank you to all of our hardworking and dedicated team members who serve our customers each and every day out there. We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance and our finish to the year. While it is difficult to predict the timing of seasonal demand trends, we know our customers do depend on us for everyday basic items and we continue to stay focused on being the most dependable supplier of their lifestyle. Our business is more than just transactional. It is building long-term trusted relationships with our customers and having what they need, when they need no matter what the season or weather.", "We appreciate your time today and I will now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on the financials and our initial look for 2015. Tony?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended December 27, 2014 on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 12% to 1.58 billion and net income grew 16.9% to 112.1 million or $0.81 per diluted share.", "Comp store sales increased 5.3% in the fourth quarter compared to an increase of 3.5% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Comp transaction count increased for the 27th consecutive quarter gaining 3% on top of a 5.1% increase last year. We are very pleased with our ability to continue driving increased foot traffic through our doors by meeting the everyday needs of our customers.", "Strong winter seasonal business and C.U.E. items were key traffic drivers in the quarter. Average comp ticket increased by 2.3% versus last year\u2019s 1.5% decrease. The increase was driven by the mix of goods and the strength of big ticket sales partially offset by deflation.", "A few key points about the quarter. Sales were strongest in the first half of the quarter coming off a very cold winter last year and with the advent of the cool temperatures in October and November, our customer anticipated another cold winter and started buying winter seasonal items earlier. We believe that this shifted much of the winter seasonal sales to earlier in the fourth quarter versus last year.", "Big ticket had a comp sales increase greater than the company average and positively impacted overall comp sales by an estimated 64 basis points. Strength in our seasonal category such as heating and outdoor power equipment drove the big ticket comp sales increase and more than offset the continued headwind in the safe category.", "Solid comp sales were widespread and not limited to any particular region as both the north and the south did well. Deflation was slightly less than we expected and we estimate that it was approximately 50 basis points in the quarter.", "Sales of direct import items increased 14% versus Q4 last year and represented 16% of the sales mix in the quarter. Sales of exclusive branded products were also very strong in the quarter increasing 11.4% and represented 29.4% of total sales.", "Turning now to gross margin, which increased approximately 16 basis points to 34%, our initial direct margin continues to improve as a result of our initiatives around price optimization, markdown management and strategic sourcing.", "Favorable colder weather provided strong sell-through of our seasonal winter products resulting in favorable markdown management, accompanied with strong price management on some key winter seasonal products. Deflation also had a positive impact on gross margin.", "Partially offsetting the benefits from our margin enhancing initiatives with freight, which increased approximately 20 basis points due to higher transportation costs primarily from the increase in stem miles to the new Western store base. This impact was much greater than the benefit we received from lower fuel costs in the quarter. The overall product mix impact was not significant this quarter.", "For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 22.8% of sales compared to 23.5% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. We are pleased with our expense control in the quarter, which coupled with strong comp sales, provided significant leverage. Strong expense control of store payroll, occupancy and marketing netted almost half of the favorable leverage.", "Incentive compensation accounted for the other half of the leverage benefit in the quarter. Our effective income tax rate increased to 36.7% in Q4 compared to 35% last year. The increase was due principally to the reversal of certain FIN 48 reserves last year.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with 51.1 million in cash compared to 142.7 million last year with no debt in both years. Our stock repurchase program was very effective in the early part of the fourth quarter as we acquired approximately 868,000 shares for 51.1 million or an average $62.35 per share price.", "Average inventory levels per store at year end increased approximately 4% compared to last year. We ended last year very light in inventory as a result of the strong sell-through in the fourth quarter. We believe that we are in better inventory position this year to take advantage of the January and February winter business. Inventory turns for the year improved 3 basis points to 3.32 times and we are pleased with the productivity of our inventory during the quarter and the full year.", "Capital expenditures for the year were 160.6 million as compared to 218.2 million last year. We opened 22 stores and closed one store in the fourth quarter compared to 31 stores opened in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the year, we opened 107 stores and closed one. The decrease in capital expenditures relates to cycling expenditures for the construction of our Southeast distribution center last year.", "We were significantly favorable to our CapEx forecast as our land cost and construction draws for the Southwest distribution facility were below our estimate, the Northeast distribution center expansion was deferred to Q1 2015 and certain IT initiatives were under budget or reprioritized.", "Now turning our attention to 2015. As Greg mentioned, we will continue to fund our ongoing operational initiatives such as logistics, merchandizing systems and omni-channel to position the company for future growth and at the same time manage the business to deliver our target of mid-teens EPS growth.", "We expect full year sales to range from 6.2 billion to 6.3 billion. We have forecasted comp sales to increase 2.5% to 4%. We are targeting EBIT margins to be flat to 10 basis points of improvement compared to 2014. We expect a modest improvement in gross margin and SG&A leverage will be dependent on the sales level achieved.", "We anticipate net income to range from approximately 403 million to 417 million or $2.95 to $3.05 per diluted share. We expect to open 110 to 115 new stores with approximately 55% to 60% scheduled to open in the first half of the year. As Greg mentioned, we will begin to transition Del\u2019s stores to Tractor Supply markets and we expect to close seven Del\u2019s stores as we backfill Washington State.", "We forecast that our effective tax rate will be approximately 37%, which is consistent with last year\u2019s rate of 36.9%. We are initially targeting 240 million to 250 million of capital expenditures in 2015 consistent with our four-year CapEx plan. The increase over last year results from the new store openings, the completion of our Southwest distribution center, our expansion plan for the Northeast distribution center and the execution of other key initiatives.", "We plan to continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program as part of our long-term balanced approach to shareholder return. We have reduced our year-end targeted cash balance to 0 to 50 million. Consistent with this past year, we expect to have seasonal borrowings at the end of the first and third quarters.", "For modeling purposes, we estimate that the diluted shares outstanding inclusive of option grant and share repurchase activity will be between 137 million and 136 million for the full year.", "So let me discuss some of the assumptions that help us form our projection for 2015. Based on current consumer confidence polls and buoyed by lower gas prices, we believe that the consumer is more optimistic. As a retailer that serves our customers everyday basic needs, we believe there is potential for upside but we also recognize that we tend to receive less of a tailwind in those retailers that are more dependent on discretionary purchases.", "Deflation was a top line headwind last year and averaged approximately 85 basis points. This year, we expect deflation to continue to be a headwind and average approximately 50 basis points ranging between 10 to 100 basis points during the year. We anticipate the impact will be higher than the first half of the year and moderating downward in the second half of the year. As we have previously discussed, it is our responsibility to manage through deflationary and inflationary periods and we believe we have demonstrated that ability in the past.", "There were some positive and negative weather events that impacted the timing of sales in 2014. This was the second year in a row that we had a late spring and an extended spring/summer that progressed late into the third quarter and favorable cold trends in the fourth quarter. We believe it was a net neutral year from a weather perspective. As we have stated in the past, we generally benefit from an early spring, therefore, if the weather pattern returns closer to normal, we would anticipate slightly stronger comp sales improvement in the first half of the year and in the back half of the year.", "As we\u2019ve emphasized in the past, we believe our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the halves not the quarters as weather patterns will change from year-to-year and shift the timing of sales between quarters. Although the first quarter has gotten off to a solid start, let me remind you that March is the most impactful month in the quarter and is very dependent on spring weather.", "We would expect improvements in gross margin rate to come from the execution of our key gross margin initiatives, continued strong markdown and inventory management and gross margin rate tailwind provided by the deflationary environment. We believe these factors will offset approximately 10 to 15 basis point headwind from increased transportation costs and the mix of merchandize. Although, we have modeled a decrease in fuel cost, it does not offset the stem mile increase as a result of the significant number of stores we opened last year in the west and project to open this year.", "In terms of cadence for gross margin percentage improvement, we target slight year-over-year improvement in each quarter expect for Q1 where we may experience a decrease as we cycle against limited markdowns as a result of last year\u2019s strong sell-through and we may also experience a slight headwind from the mix of C.U.E. items. And early spring would benefit Q2 margins as the spring mix of goods could have a positive impact. Inventory turns are expected to improve slightly. We would expect per store inventory to increase modestly consistent with the investments in key merchandizing categories.", "With respect to SG&A, as we grow the business, we have been able to absorb many of our ongoing initiatives into our expense run rate. We will continue to grow our business and the infrastructure with a long-term perspective, and as we do so some of the expected benefits may come in future periods but with the goal of driving mid-teens EPS growth. We continue to target maintaining SG&A growth in line with our sales growth. With this in mind, we expect to leverage SG&A into 3.5% to 4% comp sales range for 2015.", "With respect to SG&A by quarter, we believe that Q1 will be the most difficult quarter to leverage SG&A as it has a lower sales base and we will be executing our Northeast D.C. expansion. We expect the Southwest distribution center to open in Q4. We will be incurring preopening expense in the quarter with no transportation benefits until Q1 of 2016.", "We expect to leverage SG&A slightly in Q3 as we will be cycling our move to our new store support center last year. As in the past, we will provide more color regarding our expectations for the subsequent period at each quarterly conference call.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We go first to Alan Rifkin with Barclays.", "Alan Rifkin", "Thank you very much. I appreciate you taking my question. First question is with respect to demand planning system. Can you maybe provide some color as to how you think that will help you improve your turns or how much you think it will help you improve your working capital? If you could just maybe provide a little bit of color on what we can expect to that? Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Alan, this is Greg. The system itself is designed to do really several things. It\u2019s to help us understand that we\u2019re probably not maximizing, I would say, individual SKUs within the assortment as they sell-through in the stores. For example, if we got an item on a peg and we\u2019re selling through three items by Wednesday or Thursday of the week but yet we still have Friday and Saturday of selling days before replenishment runs and pushes inventory back to the store, demand planning is looking at that and recalculating that throughout the week and saying, wait a minute, potential missed opportunity, let\u2019s push more than three as a replenishment, let\u2019s push for six depending upon how it\u2019s pretty packed. That\u2019s the basic sales side of this and what that can mean we don\u2019t know yet. We just turned on several categories. We do think it will give us some sales lift over time. But this is a new system, work with [SaaS] [ph] on it. ", "And the other thing it should do for us, it should enable us to push more inventory to the stores on a more ready-time basis, meaning that instead of us waiting for several weeks for things to get adjusted, this will start pushing inventory a little faster which should move it through the supply chain a little faster. So what we may find is our turns may speed a little bit as we go through this, but I\u2019m not going to give you any forecast or guarantees at this point because we\u2019ve just turned it on in several departments. We like what we\u2019re seeing so far, but it\u2019s more about maximizing that inventory that\u2019s in the store today making sure that we\u2019re not running out of inventory in certain periods of time for our customer.", "Alan Rifkin", "Okay. Thank you, Greg. And one follow-up, if I may. With respect to converting the former Del\u2019s stores, can you maybe provide a schedule either by half as to how many stores we can expect will be converted? And what are the dynamics of those conversions compared to an average store with respect to incremental revenue increases? Thank you.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Alan, the way we look at it, as we go through the year, we\u2019ll try to update as to the schedule and how we\u2019ll handle the Del\u2019s stores. But generally, we look at it more on a top level basis that as we opened the new stores that Del\u2019s stores would represent about half of a TSC store and our general direction would be to count them basically as half a store net against the new store count.", "Alan Rifkin", "Okay. Is the comp ramp of those stores similar to the comp ramp of a new store, a new Tractor store?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes. We\u2019re modeling it as such. Potentially, it could be a little bit faster because we do have name recognition. So they may come out of the box a little bit stronger. But until we start to open them, we don\u2019t have any data on how they will open.", "Alan Rifkin", "Okay. Thank you. Congratulations on a solid year.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go now to Michael Lasser with UBS.", "Michael Lasser", "Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It\u2019s on the guidance for the upcoming year. You\u2019re looking for a flat to up 10 basis points on the operating margin. Your longer-term outlook calls for 25 basis points of annual improvement. So maybe you could walk us through what\u2019s going to be unique about this year that is resulting in a little less operating margin expansion than you expect?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Michael, this is Tony. When we look at the EBIT and our overall guidance, obviously over the years there will be some ebb and flow relative to our long-term targets. However, when we look at the numbers, we believe that our initiatives will continue to drive the gross margin improvement. We do anticipate obviously that headwind when it comes to freight and transportation costs as we\u2019ve opened up all the stores out west, so that does provide an additional headwind. And then relative to SG&A, we think that there is some more potential upside as depending on where we fall on the sales target. But as we have that incremental deflation that\u2019s in our forecast, that sort of dampens the sales forecast, so that limits some of the upside when it comes to the potential SG&A leverage. And then lastly, as we open up the Southwest distribution center in the latter part of the year, we don\u2019t anticipate having benefits from that until we move into 2016. So that\u2019s just a snapshot of the year.", "Michael Lasser", "Would you say collectively the amount of spending on the initiatives this year is going to be less than it was last year?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "It all depends how you define the investment. A lot of people look at investment as capital. So as we move into 2015, it does appear that our capital will be much higher because we just came off of a much lower year than I had anticipated. But when you look at investment as far as - also the related expenses, for example, if it\u2019s demand planning and additional headcount that we have to incur there, if it\u2019s opening up mixing centers and some of the startup costs related to a particular center, there\u2019s several things that are included in our forecast that are part of the expense structure as well that I would consider to be investing in the future and driving some of our key initiatives. So, when we look at investment, we look at both the capital side and the expense structure. And clearly as a growth company, we will continue to incur those and I believe that we have a significant portion of those already in our run rate and that\u2019s why we are focused on still delivering mid-teens EPS growth.", "Michael Lasser", "Okay. And a quick follow-up. You have just over 10% of our store base in Texas and North Dakota. Obviously, those economies could be in a little bit of slowdown given what\u2019s happened in the price of oil. How impactful would that be to your total business and your comp given that those stores have probably been above average for the last couple of years?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Hi, Michael. It\u2019s Steve Barbarick here. We do have a number of oil drilling stores that we track and monitor and we went through an analysis over the last three or four months and right now those stores are tracking in line with our comp store sales. So, we don\u2019t see any major changes or material impact at this point in those stores.", "Michael Lasser", "Okay. And do you think there could be an offset \u2013 if there were a slowdown, there would be an offset from the 90% of your stores that are not in oil levered areas given that your typical customer drives at a greater distance to your store than the average consumer to a store?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "No. I would tell you at this point when it comes to those oil drilling stores, I mean if the comps are in line with the existing store base that trend will likely continue and we\u2019re watching it closely. And the next time we get together, if that question comes up, we\u2019ll give you more information on it. ", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "But to answer your question, as I said in the prepared remarks, we believe that there is potential and we\u2019re optimistic as to consumer behavior and the additional funds available because of lower gas cost for our consumer, but again we\u2019re a basic needs company and less susceptible to the sort of discretionary expense.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go now to Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter Benedict", "Hi, guys. Thanks. A quick follow up on that one. So, Steve, when you did the analysis on the oil markets, I mean how many stores would you guys consider to be kind of I guess really exposed to kind of the fracing activity and things like that?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes, looking at the numbers, we think right now it\u2019s about 10% of our store base, but again that ebbs and flows depending upon new rigs and what we\u2019re doing out there, but that\u2019s what we see right now.", "Peter Benedict", "Okay. Thank you. And then just on the average ticket strength that you\u2019ve see despite the deflation \u2013 we\u2019ve now have a couple of quarters in a row, do you think we\u2019re turning the corner on some of the big ticket stuff or what do you need to see on that front in order to kind of maybe play a little more aggressively on those items? Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Peter, I would tell you that this last year was a good year in big ticket for us [indiscernible] but I don\u2019t think anyone here is ready to declare victory when it comes to big ticket. We\u2019re watching the POS data very closely and we\u2019re making tweaks to replenishment if we see any changes in consumers spending patterns. But right now I think we\u2019ve got a good plan laid out and we\u2019re just watching the trend line. So, again, we\u2019re being cautiously optimistic when it comes to big ticket.", "Peter Benedict", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We now go to John Lawrence with Stephens.", "John Lawrence", "Good afternoon, guys.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Hi, John.", "John Lawrence", "Just real quick. I know Steve you mentioned some, on the last quarterly call about some of the resets and how successful that was with product being in line and across all departments. Did that momentum continue into the fourth?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "John, you heard Greg talk a little bit about the balance of our sales in Q4 and I would tell you, we talk a lot internally about making sure that the four walls of the box are working. And we came out of Q4 feeling pretty good about the fact that we\u2019re getting customers all the way around the building. A lot of that is a byproduct to the resets that we\u2019ve done. I would tell you we talked a little bit about the west side resets in the last call and we continue to see some nice sales momentum out of the work that we did back in '14.", "John Lawrence", "Great. Thanks. Tony, can you give any insight on that gross margin; freight was up 20. What was the offset related to lower fuel?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "The offset, it was just in the direct margin on our products. And again, Steve and the team did a great job in driving gross margin through our initiatives and in particular we really drove our price management, especially on some key seasonal product and that helped drive the initial margin on the product.", "John Lawrence", "All right, thanks. Last one, is it too early to give us any kind of sense, the new Southwest D.C. reduction in stem miles or cost savings for that facility?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "John, it\u2019s Greg. The only thing I can tell you is when I\u2019m having to move freight to those stores in the far west over 1,000 miles, you can imagine the savings when I can say I can now get it within a 300 mile radius. We\u2019ve got some numbers that we\u2019ve run against it and I\u2019m not going to share the specifics yet because that building really won\u2019t come online until late next year. We\u2019re only going to see the benefit in '16, but it will be considerable, yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow up. We now go to David Magee with SunTrust.", "David Magee", "Hi. Good afternoon. Congrats on a good quarter.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "David Magee", "Could you help us quantify the big ticket opportunity? Knock on wood, it continues to be more robust for you over the next couple of years, maybe indicate what percent of the mix it was back in its peak before and where we are now or just anything you can say to help us get our arms around that would be helpful?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "David, this is Tony. It really is very difficult to quantify. I would tell you what we classify as big ticket is a really, really, really small percentage of the sales. And you can imagine those items over $350 compared to an average ticket of $46 to $48. But just a swing in that number of a few basis points can have a nice impact on the average ticket. So, as we looked at the year or in the quarter, in particular, items that are needs based, it could be a log splitter or a snow blower do particularly well and those are the items that generally are some of the drivers when it comes to big ticket. We do have some items that are more discretionary such as all-terrain vehicles and/or utility vehicles that we have that are very high priced as well. So, there\u2019s several things that will drive that, but again our customer is much more needs based and it\u2019s around that versus their discretionary spend.", "David Magee", "Thank you, Tony. And just as a follow up, can you tell us what percent of the ecommerce volume is being picked up in the stores? And is that a number that would surprise you?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s surprising. I think it\u2019s in line with a lot that others see. It could potentially be a little bit higher for us because the many things that we have are very large and bulky and the transportation is high, so they find it much more efficient to come to the store to pick it up. But we ship about 30% of our products go to the store, which again we think is great because it will take our customer to the store and could lead to potential increase in sales at the store level.", "David Magee", "Got you. Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We now go to Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, you mentioned aback to back late spring and this past year didn\u2019t break until seemingly late in May. Are you planning for an earlier spring sort of like how you planned for an early cold and you saw a great sell-through there? And are there any notable assortment changes in the seasonal category whether it\u2019s live goods or other consumable tests like you did with mulch and other tests that you ran this past year?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "We learned over the course of our careers in retail that trying to guess the weather you\u2019re never right. So you\u2019re always better going into a season with your carts loaded and your assortments out there for customers to see, because if you miss that first window, a lot of times you don\u2019t get that customer back. So we\u2019ve made some strategic inventory investments no different than we did in the fall. You heard Tony talk a little bit about that. So many of our outside products whether it be the fencing category, something we\u2019re doing with the outdoor power equipment, a little more careful with live goods because you got to be careful with the weather there. But we\u2019ll be ready for the season should we get an earlier season than we had the one last two years. We do plan for a normal spring. I will mention that as well. And a normal spring typically comes earlier than what we\u2019ve seen in the last two years.", "Christopher Horvers", "Okay. And then as a follow-up question, Tony, what was the drag from saves \u2013 or whomever, what was the drag from saves in the fourth quarter? And does that flatten out as we look forward now that you\u2019re lapped down year-over-year comparisons? And then on depreciation and amortization dollars, how are you expecting those in 2015? Thanks.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "All right. Chris, when it comes to the saves, we haven\u2019t provided that information as to what the percentage is and to what the drag was. As we\u2019ve worked through the year 2014, we were lapping some very strong numbers, so we would expect over 2015 that that headwind will moderate to a certain extent. So as we move into 2015, it should be less of a headwind. When it comes to depreciation, we\u2019re really looking at it and again we don\u2019t give quarter guidance, but overall we\u2019re looking at it sort of similar proration relative to 2014. We don\u2019t see anything unique about 2015 when it comes to depreciation and how you model it.", "Christopher Horvers", "But what was the dollar share your modeling for the entire year?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "We usually let you guys try to figure that one out. But generally, we\u2019re going to see around \u2013 a little bit over 10% increase when it comes to depreciation.", "Christopher Horvers", "Okay, very helpful. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go now to Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Denise Chai", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a strong quarter.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Denise Chai", "Just wanted to get some more color on comps in the pet category and also could you give us a bit of an update on hometown pets? Are you planning to expand the tests at all? How do categories that you\u2019re seeing \u2013 categories in customers there differ from your core stores? And have you found in your learnings yet that you\u2019re already being able to transfer to your core stores?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Okay. I\u2019m going to start with this one. In terms of the pet business in Tractor Supply, we\u2019ve talked a lot about C.U.E. as an organization and this fits into that area. We talked about the strength of the four walls. The pet business for us continues to perform well and it\u2019s had continued momentum for a number of years now. We continue to modify assortments and bring in new and different things for our customers and it really suits our lifestyle. In terms of hometown pet, Lee?", "Lee J. Downing", "Denise, this is Lee. Hometown pet is still \u2013 that\u2019s probably too early to call. We are very pleased with the progress and the learning that we have, but after only three months of being opened with the two locations, I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s time for us to make any solid decisions on what we\u2019re going to do going forward. Right now it\u2019s a test and we\u2019re going to continue to learn and see how it applies to Tractor Supply.", "Denise Chai", "Okay, understood. And just as a follow-up, in terms of your new stores this year, should we see those weighted more towards newer markets like the west as compared to fill-ins? And how would the mix of markets compare to 2014?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I think this is a year where we\u2019ll continue to see a balanced approach throughout the country. I think we really like the west and we like the performance, but I think this year we went across a number of stores, probably a third, a third, a third if you look at it west center and east, so I don\u2019t feel it will be anything different this year.", "Denise Chai", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go now to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.", "Simeon Gutman", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Tony, a follow-up question on the gasoline, I guess more of the cost of goods side, the stem miles, because I guess if you have 1,300 or so stores or almost 1,400 now, the savings that you get in the existing store and existing stem miles I guess conceptually would seem like they should start to offset some of the higher cost you\u2019re getting from the new Western markets. And I realize you\u2019re not going to give us what stem miles is, but maybe percentage wise just order of magnitude, what is that not enough to offset what\u2019s happening for the greater mileage out west?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "A couple of things. One, we absolutely did include a projection as far as some of the fuel prices through the year. And again, it\u2019s difficult because fuel is extremely low right now. We\u2019re not sure how that will hold up throughout the course of the year. When it comes to the stem miles it is significant because it\u2019s not necessarily just the west stores, but as we open up and backfill in the east, a main store or a Massachusetts store could be very far from our Hagerstown DC. So we incur some additional stem miles as well with some of the backfill stores. So, I know you don\u2019t have a lot of details and we really don\u2019t provide it, but the stem miles, the additional cost exceeds the benefit of the lower diesel price. In addition to that, obviously we continue to increase our imports and so we have rising costs relative to imports. We also have \u2013 we anticipate having some driver cost increase to the transportation and then obviously there\u2019s always EPA and other government regulations that tend to drive the cost as well. So we do model some additional cost outside of the stem miles.", "Simeon Gutman", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my follow up on also gross margin but more on the product side. Can you remind us what the product margin advantage is for exclusive brands over national? And then I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve said it about the same thing for direct import over non-imported? And then how that spread is? Is it static or is it getting better for you over time?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "I\u2019ll answer that, Simeon. When it comes to the private label or exclusive brands, generally we\u2019ll see somewhere between 400 and 600 basis points. On a pure import, we\u2019re probably going to see somewhere between 600 and 1,000 basis point improvement. Now when I say a pure import, what I\u2019m talking about is when we\u2019re taking what is normally being sourced domestically and we move it over and bring it in generally from the Far East, there are times where our domestic distributor is also bringing in the product from the Far East and we insert ourselves into the process to reduce some of the transportation costs. In those cases, we will not experience 600 to 1,000 basis point improvement. It will be much lower. But generally our guidance is about 400 to 600 on the exclusive brands and around 800 ballpark for the imports.", "Simeon Gutman", "Okay. Thank you. Nice results.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We go now to Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam Sindler", "Just to follow up on that and the fuel cost, but I mean clearly with stem miles being such a big issue and with fuel cost much lower, the headwind from stem miles should be lower in 2015 versus 2014. Is that correct?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes, that is correct.", "Adam Sindler", "Okay, great. And then just on the mixing centers, any reason why you chose Texas as the market to test that?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes, simply put that\u2019s where we have the largest concentration of our feed business and highest velocity of that business, so there\u2019s no better place to test it than there.", "Adam Sindler", "Got it, very good. Thanks, guys. Great results. Appreciate it.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go now to Jessica Mace with Nomura Securities", "Jessica Schoen Mace", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Hi, Jessica.", "Jessica Schoen Mace", "The first question I had was a follow up on the demand planning. You mentioned that you just this quarter began to turn it on in a few categories. What\u2019s your timeline and expectation for how that will progress over 2015?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "This is Greg. Let me give you a little bit of some insights about how this really works. Demand planning is being layered on top of our replenishment system. So it\u2019s going to make that system work a little harder, a little smarter. And we tested it initially, had good results, but this is no different than when we turned on Revionics and pricing optimization. You want to make sure that as you start to layer these systems on, they\u2019re doing what you expect and each category will act a little differently; different in hardware than it will probably be over in, let\u2019s say, pet toys and things of that nature. So, we\u2019re going to be very careful that we don\u2019t jump the gun on this and make sure that we know the type of results we expect to get. So, it\u2019s going to be a [indiscernible]. It\u2019s probably going to be sometime in '16, maybe over '16 before it\u2019s complete.", "Jessica Schoen Mace", "Great, understood. And then my second question is on ecommerce. Even though it\u2019s still a small part of the business, are there any overall categories that translate best online where you\u2019ve seen a lot more volume in the merchandize mix?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, I think you can easily understand that some of the very, very large ticket items can be challenging because they have to go LTL delivery, they can\u2019t be pulled out of a distribution center as easily and dropped into a box and shipped to the customer. So things like apparel, footwear, things that are smaller in size are easier picks for us, but it\u2019s interesting though. We have had a nice LTL business. It\u2019s a safe business in some other large categories. So for us you have to think about why the customer would chose to shop online versus coming to the store and it\u2019s primarily they have the time to be able to take the receipt of the product. They don\u2019t have an urgent need to have it today. Many of our customers come in and I need it now. So online would not serve that. But they\u2019re looking at it from a standpoint of convenience and ease of shopping with us and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to look at our business as more of an omni-channel business today where we\u2019re trying to give the customer the ability to shop with us anytime, anyplace, anywhere.", "Jessica Schoen Mace", "So would you say customers are finding that as a good solution for the C.U.E. business or more so the other ones you mentioned, like apparel and --?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I would say less for C.U.E. probably and more for the other things that are more unique; it could be a tractor part, it could be a pair of shoes and it could be something that they see in seasonal. But I think for the heavy, heavy high velocity, C.U.E. items at this point it doesn\u2019t seem to be that desirable for the customer just yet.", "Jessica Schoen Mace", "Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions.", "Operator", "We now go to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matt Nemer", "Hi. Good afternoon. Just two quick ones. First, how many stores will pull from the new Arizona, D.C. when it launches in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, could you give us a little bit of insight into any product resets or updated planograms that you\u2019re planning in the first half of this year? Thanks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "When the D.C. and the Southwest opens, it will be servicing less than 100 stores initially. And as far as new planograms sets and such, I\u2019ll let Steve take that one.", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes, I mean we rarely get into the specifics around planograms and resets, but I can tell you one of the focus areas for us as an organization is going to be around newness. And in terms of newness you\u2019re going to see it through resets, you\u2019re going to see it through testing and you\u2019re going to see it through localization. The team is highly focused in those areas as well as on the C.U.E. side of our business. We\u2019re looking at broadening assortments, managing the inventory, so we\u2019ll make sure that we\u2019re a dependable supplier and making sure we\u2019re priced right in the market. So generally speaking, we\u2019re not going to give specifics about the resets but I can tell you there\u2019s a lot of work being done behind the scenes.", "Matt Nemer", "Can you expect any significant changes to the outside of the store, the outside area of the store?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Here\u2019s what I can tell you. We have talked about this on several calls and we tested a number of things in 2014 that were unique and different and we just didn\u2019t gain a whole lot of traction relative to those initiatives. I can tell you that the sales on the outside of the building are better than they\u2019ve been. We continue to see comp store sales pretty strong in a couple of key areas out there, but there\u2019s still more work to be done and we will be doing more testing in '15. We just haven\u2019t figured out how to get more traffic into that side yard.", "Matt Nemer", "Okay, very helpful. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "We now go to Mark Miller with William Blair.", "Mark Miller", "Hi, everyone. I think in Tony your prepared remarks in the headwind column for gross margins, you mentioned the mix of merchandize. So, can you elaborate on that? Are you highlighting to simply the effects of continued growth in C.U.E. and possibly big ticket? And then I have a question on private label. You had nice growth there over the years, but I think in the back half it was pretty flattish or maybe down a little bit as a percent of sales. What\u2019s the outlook for that and key initiatives if you think you can grow that in 2015?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Sure, Mark. This is Tony. I\u2019ll let Steve handle the private label, but just very briefly you\u2019re correct. The main driver when it comes to mix merchandize and the potential headwind is really around C.U.E. and our continued increasing C.U.E. as part of the mix.", "Steve K. Barbarick", "In terms of exclusive brands for private label, what we saw really in the back half had a lot to do with the inflation. A lot of our exclusive brands are around some of the C.U.E. items and they just weren\u2019t as high a percent of sales.", "Mark Miller", "Okay. And then a separate question on incentive comp in your '15 plan. Are you assuming that incentive comp is a similar percent of sales, is it back to normal, how is that changing? Thanks.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Generally, we\u2019ll look at it in 2015 as a similar percentage relative to 2014.", "Mark Miller", "All right, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go now to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.", "Brian Nagel", "Hi. Good afternoon. Congrats on a nice quarter.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Brian Nagel", "A couple of follow up \u2013 quick follow ups here. With all the talk about stem miles and gas prices, just remind us, due to any type of hedging with respect to fuel cost, are there any type of contracts that could delay a benefit of lower prices on new distribution?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Brian, no. We currently have not hedged nor have we in the past. It is something that we would evaluate but there\u2019s nothing that would prevent us from capturing fuel cost in the current environment.", "Brian Nagel", "Okay. Tony, you commented in your prepared remarks that this year we saw may be a stronger sales of winter product early in the season as people stocked up. Does that pose any type of potential risk to comps to sales in the first quarter as maybe as demand [indiscernible] is that largely washed out through the course of fourth quarter?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes. I was trying to give a little bit of color as to the quarter and how it shaped up, but as we moved into 2015 I had also indicated that we really felt that we were in a great inventory position to be in a better shape than we were last year to take advantage of the cold weather in January and February timeframe. And we feel very good about the replenishment cycle and our ability to get goods into the store as we move through the fourth quarter and into 2015.", "Brian Nagel", "Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll keep it quick. Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We go now to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Fassler", "Thanks a lot. Good afternoon.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Hi, Matt.", "Matthew Fassler", "My first question guys relates to deflation. It moderated a bit in the fourth quarter versus the third. As I look at the inputs, you often talk about \u2013 obviously fuel is down substantially, the metal piece is down as well. Grains look like they\u2019re a little bit less of a drag. Was it that grains piece impacting deflation in C.U.E. products or were there other factors there? And kind of in tandem with that question, Tony, during your run through of the quarter, you talked about price management in seasonal products. Just wanted to understand what that meant and how that might have factored in?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Sure. Matt, on deflation, again, you hit the nail on the head. It was really the corn prices and the feed. They tend to cycle through a little bit quicker. As much as we did have the benefit on the oil and steel, they take awhile for that to sort of cycle through. So really the corn was the main driver.", "Matthew Fassler", "And so \u2013 sorry, go ahead.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I was going to move then to the price management.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes. When we came into the season, I think we had strong retail price points. We got the early season sales which certainly benefited us, so we didn\u2019t get on the back half of the season. And we also saw a lot of strong demand on certain categories and some shortages in some areas. So rather than bringing prices down, we\u2019re able to maintain and we saw a lift in margins as a result.", "Matthew Fassler", "Any particular categories where that played out?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Seasonal, mainly in the heating categories.", "Matthew Fassler", "Got it. And then just finally to go back to your initial answer as you modeled deflation, it sounds like probably deepening a little bit again, a couple tenths perhaps from Q4 to the first part of the year. Is there anything that you\u2019ve seen in grains, which I guess remain under some pressure here or is there more the flow through of petrol and metals, et cetera, any impact that that will have on some of the slower cycle businesses?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Again, to start off the season we expect a tick up in the deflation more related to the corn prices and cycling against last year. The oil and steel, a little bit more of a wildcard. As we move through the year, we will have a much better feel for that and how those prices adjust and how that can flow through our inventory comps.", "Matthew Fassler", "Got it, guys. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Now we go to Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "Good afternoon, everyone, and great quarter. Guys, when you\u2019re looking at the big ticket merchandize, can you sort of spill out for us what\u2019s driving that? Was is the pickup in demand by a more confident consumer as some of their stuff wearing out, so they need it now or was the certain aspects of the weather helping that?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "I would say that it\u2019s probably a little bit of all that, but weather certainly did help. We talked earlier about a lot of the seasonal businesses taking off early, things like log splitters and some heating products, snow blowers and the like. So, we saw the benefit of that in the back half. But like we said, this has been a trend and we finished the year with a big ticket increase. We tend to be cautiously optimistic as we go into next year and we\u2019re looking at assortments. And if the customer is willing to vote up, we\u2019re willing to bring him the product to service their lifestyle.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "Excellent. And how about the strong dollar and cost of imported product, what\u2019s that doing to margin? What do you expect it to do to margins?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "At this point, we haven\u2019t seen a material impact one way or the other. We\u2019re watching it very closely. The team\u2019s just gotten back from overseas right now putting together a spring program for the following year and we\u2019re watching it very closely. But I don\u2019t see that having a material impact on the business.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "All right, thank you.", "Operator", "We now go to Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.", "Aram Rubinson", "[Indiscernible] good job on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. I think, Tony, you mentioned that you thought the consumer was feeling more optimistic. And I know your results were terrific. It didn\u2019t really show necessary acceleration from prior quarters, so I\u2019m just wondering what it is may be underneath that you\u2019re seeing whether it\u2019s particular customer types or just small nuances in the business to get us get confident in that trend?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Again, relative to the comments, the prepared remarks, we were sort of looking at 2015 and the consumer and what we keep hearing about the consumer. When we look at our business, I think Steve\u2019s talked about it a little bit, we\u2019ll step up to the plate when it comes to need-based purchase and we\u2019ve seen them move to some higher price point and larger ticket items. So we see that in our consumer. We see a little bit of an increase in items per transaction. So they\u2019re coming in and they\u2019re putting a little bit more in their basket. So there are some minor trends, but again as much as we\u2019re optimistic that the consumer is more confident coming into 2015, we do realize that we are more of a needs based retailer and may not get the uptick that other retailers that are more focused on discretionary benefits.", "Aram Rubinson", "And then just a follow up as you\u2019re looking at 2015. I understand the composition of sales but can you tell us about kind of new merchandize adds, new brands, things that you\u2019re kind of super excited about that we should be thinking about as accretive to the year?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "I would go back to the philosophy of continuous improvement and risk taking with that question. The merchant team and the organization is excited about a lot of the new things we\u2019ll be bringing out this next year and it\u2019s not in any specific area. And I would tell you it\u2019s across the board. Like I said earlier, we\u2019re going to focus on newness when it comes to resets and things we\u2019re doing in the center course of our stores. A lot of testing and localization is going to take place and the focus will continue to be on C.U.E. items. So we\u2019re not going to get off track of what\u2019s got us here. We\u2019re just going to be better at what we\u2019ve done.", "Aram Rubinson", "Sounds like a good plan. Thanks for the taking the question.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll go to Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.", "Seth Basham", "Thanks a lot and good evening.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Hi, Seth.", "Seth Basham", "My question\u2019s around fuel price as well, just trying to understand a little bit better, if I go back and look at what happened in 2009 where there were big declines in the fuel prices, diesel was down between 40% and 50% for most of the year. You guys are saving anywhere from 40 to 50 basis points in gross margin as a result. Is there anything different about your business now? I would think that for result this time around it should be magnified in terms of the amount of savings per percentage point decline in fuel prices given the increased stem miles that you\u2019re running?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Well, history does have a tendency to repeat itself but again as we move into 2015, we\u2019re looking at the trend in the business and we put together what we believe is a model that is very consistent with how we model in the years past.", "Seth Basham", "Got you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I think here some factors are different, a lot more stores in the west. There\u2019s other conditions with just the availability of equipment and drivers. Now those things didn\u2019t happen back in 2009. So we talked to the trucking industry people, they\u2019ll give you some \u2013 a little bit of education on what is really different today versus back then.", "Seth Basham", "Got you, okay. And then secondly, a different question, on C.U.E. In terms of the margin headwind for 2015, would you expect it to be bigger or smaller relative to 2014?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Relative to the merchandize mix headwind, it should moderate relative to 2014 and sort of similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. It was a little bit more limited relative to what had transpired in the first three quarters of the year. So we expect it to moderate but we still anticipate it to be a headwind.", "Seth Basham", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go now to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard", "Thank you. A question for Steve, interested in the experience in 2014 specifically with the infill stores and the West Coast stores, anything that you\u2019ve learned that you\u2019re applying in '15 in terms of merchandizing to sustain productivity in those stores or enhanced productivity in those new stores?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Well, out west, I\u2019ll tell you, our model I would go as far as to say about 85% of our model or basic model will work most places geographically. There\u2019s probably maybe another 15% that needs to be tweaked by area of the country. And when we went out west, I would say that you know what, our first effort was fair, it wasn\u2019t right on. We continue to tweak and modify those assortments. There are things that we\u2019ll learn out there that probably will be applied back at this point, but I\u2019m not prepared to go through looking at those items. But you know what, there\u2019s a lot of tests that we do with the existing stores that I\u2019m sure the West Coast stores will benefit from as well. So in general, I would tell you there\u2019s still a lot of learning to be done out west when it comes to assortments.", "Eric Bosshard", "That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly within hometown pet, a similar type of question and I know it\u2019s early days, but the experience and the outlook for learnings from that being applicable across the store base, what are your thoughts or experience to-date in that regard?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes, I would say at this point it\u2019s still so early in the game to take much from that. We\u2019re watching it closely and as we learn from that, we will be applying it back to the model but it will be a test at the Tractor stores before all.", "Eric Bosshard", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go now to Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Joseph Feldman", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question as well. I wanted to ask just a couple of quick follow-ups. The couple of mixing centers that you\u2019re going to open this year, can you remind us what the kind of long-term target for mixing centers are and what kind of impact it does have on the margins?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Joe, this is Greg. Mixing centers as we have scoped them and this is an initial pass, probably 20 to 30 across the country. Again, placing these where we have a high \u2013 a large animal count and where we do a tremendous amount of, let\u2019s say, feed type business. There are some that we\u2019ll place in the Northeast because of the wood pellet business and things of that nature. But remember, these are going to be used to push full palletized, high velocity product to the stores much faster in a way from putting it away in a normal distribution center and pulling it back. So it\u2019s going to really bring the stem mile usage way down on some of that kind of product.", "Joseph Feldman", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And I guess initially, have you seen any \u2013 like is it a significant margin benefit? I guess I trust the stem miles pretty significantly but --?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "It\u2019s a little bit of a drag because there\u2019s some SG&A you got to put into place initially and there is a benefit on the other side where the stem miles are cut and the turnaround time of holding an inventory is going to be sustainably less. So if I can push inventory to a store four times a week versus having to do it in large quantities once a week or once every two weeks, there\u2019s a lot of benefit to that.", "Joseph Feldman", "Yes, that makes sense. And then just one other quick question. How are you guys doing in terms of tailoring the store to the local markets? I know it\u2019s kind of this ongoing evolution, but where do you think you are at this point and I know where you want to be, but where are we in that process?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes, this is Steve. Every time I feel like we\u2019re making progress, I realize that there\u2019s a lot more work to do. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever be able to get it exactly right because there\u2019s so much opportunity out there. And our merchant teams are tasked with travelling to different markets. We get a lot of feedback from the field. That\u2019s one of the great things about our organization. And we work as a team to make sure that we\u2019re taking care of the customer and the right markets and serving the lifestyle. So, I couldn\u2019t even give you an inning at this point. All I can tell you is there\u2019s a lot more work that we can do.", "Joseph Feldman", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Good luck with this quarter guys. Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Sandfort for any closing remarks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you, operator.

I'm here today with Tony Crudele, our Chief Financial Officer, Greg Sandfort, our President and Chief Merchandising Officer, Stan Ruta, our Chief Operating Officer.", "Our team did an outstanding job as we, again, delivered higher-than-expected net income driven by significant improvement in gross margin and modest top line growth.  As you recall we are cycling against a number of factors that benefited our performance from last year including landfall hurricanes in both Louisiana and Texas which created high demand for emergency preparation and response items, volatile fuel prices that created early sell through of heating products and high inflation levels which provided tail winds for our sales.", "We recognize that this will be a challenging quarter and I'm even more pleased with our achievements in light of the headwinds that we faced.  We took a proactive approach towards planning and we executed our strategies very well.  Let me go into more detail about the strategies that allowed us to win in the third quarter and are continuing to position us for success for the remainder of this year and beyond.", "First, our merchandise assortment supports our customers' everyday lifestyle needs.  We have a thorough understanding of what is relevant to our customers, our core consumable, usable or edible or [Q] categories are very attractive to consumers looking for a one-stop destination for products that fit their rural lifestyle at a compelling value.", "These items, including animal and pet related products, repair and maintenance parts for machinery and lubricants are continuing to drive footsteps into our stores.  We are pleased that we delivered positive comp transaction growth for the sixth consecutive quarter.  We continue to explore opportunities to build upon the strength of our [Q] categories.", "In the last few weeks we've introduced a select equine and livestock feeds from Purina and Nutrena to our stores nationwide.  Early response to these prominent brands has been positive.  We believe that adding nationally recognized best selling feed brands for the first time will drive category expansion and attract the new customers.", "Secondly, we intensified our focus on managing gross margin net of advertising, one of the key metrics that we are using to both plan and to gauge our team's performance.  In doing so we planned our inventories and manage markdowns carefully to ensure that inventory was fresh and selling at optimal price points.", "For the eighth consecutive quarter we reduced total per-store inventory levels at a year-over-year basis.  Concurrently we improved our in stock position on key items, our strategy to focus on the top 20 merchandise categories and the top 250 SKUs continues to service well by ensuring that the products our customers need the most are in stock and in quantity.", "The benefit of eliminating television advertising in favor or direct marketing was not as substantial as it was in Q2 since we've not historically used television during the third quarter.", "Third, we are maintaining disciplined expense control.  We successfully kept our cost down and improved the shopping experience for our customers.  We continue to emphasize and invest in the train of our team to ensure that a store execution is a leading competitive advantage for us.", "We are proud that we continue to improve upon our customer loyalty stores.  Our customers are recognizing that we have had the products they need and our giving our stores high marks for organization and friendly, knowledgeable service.", "Overall we're pleased with the performance in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2009.  Throughout the year we maintained our focus on continuing to differentiate our stores and executing our retail strategy.  Our ability to perform well consistently is a testament to our working as one cohesive and cross functional team.", "We are using the breadth and depth of information across the organization as well as individual and collective expertise to work towards the best outcomes for our customers, our business and our shareholders.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Tony to review our financial performance and to discuss the outlook for the year.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Thanks, Jim.  And good afternoon, everyone.  As Jim noted, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter as we continue to proactively navigate through a number of headwinds.", "On a year-over-year basis we grew sales and EPS, effectively managed our margins, generated an increase in customer traffic and reduced our per-store inventory levels for the eighth consecutive quarter.  ", "For the third quarter ended September 26, 2009 net sales grew by 1.9% to $747.7 million.  And net income grew by 38.5% to $22.0 million or $0.60 per diluted share.  Total comp store sales in the period decreased 5.1% compared to last year's 6.2% increase and non-comp sales were $51 million or 6.8% of sales.", "We estimated that comp sales were negatively impacted by approximately 110 basis points as a result of cycling last year's emergency preparation and response sales related to the two gulf hurricanes.  We estimated inflation was approximately flat and had no significant impact on comp on a year-over-year basis in Q3.", "While we have seen some deflationary pressure in certain categories such as livestock, feed and fencing, there has also been some retail price increases in areas such as pet food and finished steel products.", "We continue to gain customers and our customers are continuing to shop more frequently primarily for essentials that support their rural lifestyle.  The comp transaction count increased 5.9% and we are very pleased that we continue to drive footsteps into the store.  This is even more favorable when considering the traffic generated last year from the hurricane activity and pre-selling of heating fuel.", "The average comp ticket decreased 10.4% resulting principally from softness in the sale of big-ticket items such as stoves and furnaces.  Our core consumable, usable and edible categories including animal and pet related products, continue to be the key merchandise drivers of our sales.", "Additionally, all repair and replacement part categories continue to perform well as the consumers are extending the life of their assets in a last effort to postpone big-ticket purchases.  Seasonal items such as heating and hurricane-related emergency preparation and response merchandise face a difficult year-over-year comparisons and comped below chain average.", "Weather, with the exception of no hurricane activity, was neutral year-over-year.  Sales were the strongest in the mid south, southeast as we cycled against drought conditions in the prior year.  Sales were the weakest in the southwest as areas of Texas had an expansive drought compared to much more favorable conditions in the year before.", "Comp sales in our Del stores were better than chain average.  Feed and hay make up a significant portion of Del\u2019s product mix.  And while we are pleased with Del\u2019s transaction count increase in these categories, these gains were partially offset by deflation in these categories.  Overall, we are pleased with Del's gross margin improvement and their ability to exceed plan.", "Turning now to gross margin, compared to the prior year quarter we increased gross margin by 317 basis points to 32.9% of sales.  The favorable LIFO provision relative to last year's abnormally large provision accounted for 119 basis points of the improvement.  The LIFO provision was approximately $0.03 per share in the third quarter of '09 compared to $0.17 in the third quarter of 2008.  ", "Three other components contribute to growth margin improvement.  The first, lower freight expense compared to the prior year, with a strong drive of this improvement resulting from fuel price decreases relative to last year and benefit from our transportation cost-saving initiatives.  Reduction in freight expense was 73 basis points of the gross margin improvement.  Second, lower markdown impact, as we have kept inventory fresh and achieved a good markdown cadence, we\u2019ve minimized exposure to market erosion from the markdown.  And third, continued vendor support from our merchandise initiative and promotions.", "For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization was 28.1% of sales; which was 194 basis points increase over the prior year quarter.  Although we did not leverage SG&A expense, due to the decline in comp sales, we are still pleased with the SG&A expense control.  In addition to the leveraging impact from the comp sales decrease, the following attributed to the deleveraging.  The incentive plan accrual was higher than percent of sales compared to last year\u2019s quarter.  We increased our sales tax reserve, as several states have initiated or have notified us of their intent to conduct sales audits.  And lastly, we experienced the expected deleveraging from new store growth relative to the mature store base.", "With respect to marketing, our expense was flat as a percent of sales compared to Q3 last year.  As we noted in our last conference call, we generally do not spend TV dollars in Q3 and therefore did not benefit as significantly as we did in Q2.  Importantly, we continue to drive comp transaction increase, without increasing our advertising spend, thus effectively managing gross margin dollars net of advertising expense.  Pre-opening expenses for the new stores were $1.9 million, compared to $2.1 million in the prior year quarter.  In the third quarter, we opened 17 stores, compared to 20 stores opening last year.  Pre-opening expenses per store was consistent on a year-over-year basis.  ", "Turning to the balance sheets, we are pleased with the inventory productivity.  At quarter end, inventory levels per store were down approximately 4.8% on top of an 8.5% decrease at the end of Q3 last year.  Our calculation is based on average cost of inventory and excludes in-transit and inventory held in unopened stores.  It\u2019s important to note that we achieved the decrease in per-store inventory while simultaneously increasing our in-stock percentage.  ", "Annualized inventory turns for the quarter were 2.7 times, a 4 basis points decrease over last year\u2019s third quarter.  We are pleased with our inventory productivity, given the comp store sales decrease while also improving our in-stock position on our key 20 to 50 SKUS and improving receipt flow for winter purchases.  On a year-to-date basis, inventories turns have improved 7 basis points.  We did have a decrease in inventory financing from 44.9%, down 350 basis points, as we have been more aggressive in working with our vendors to insure we capture discounts.  ", "Capital expenses for the quarter were at $15.3 million, related principally to our new store openings program.  This compares to $15.4 million in last year\u2019s third quarter.  During the third quarter, we made limited purchases under our stock repurchase program.  We purchased approximately 19,400 shares for $915,000, for a cumulative total of $214.7 million since the inception of the program of February of 2007.  The share repurchase program did not have a significant impact on EPS for the quarter or year-to date. ", "We are extremely confident in our cash flow and liquidity position.  We had no revolver debt as we moved into what has generally been one of our peak borrowing periods, as we\u2019ve built inventory for the winter holiday season. We had $95 million in cash, compared to a net borrowed position $6.8 million last year at quarter end.   We have demonstrated an ongoing commitment to carry higher cash and more liquidity, to ensure we are managing our balance sheets prudently in the current environment.  ", "Turning to our outlook for the full year.  In our business update release earlier this month, we raise our previously financial expectations for full-year net income to a range of $2.88 to $2.98 per diluted share compared to our previous guidance of $2.78 to $2.92 per diluted share.  We have narrowed our full year sales range to between $3.17 billion and $3.2 billion, compared to our previous guidance of $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion.  Correspondingly, we have narrowed our guidance for same-store sales for the year to range between a decline of 1% to 2% compared to our previous expectation of flat to a decrease of 2%.  ", "Let me discuss a few of the underlying assumptions for the remainder of the year, included in our full year guidance.  With respect to sales, we have balanced our full-year guidance to reflect a combination of current economic trends and our performance for the year-to-date period.  As we look ahead to the fall, winter, and holiday season, we have taken a cautious perspective that we believe is appropriate.  ", "Our approach considers the following factors.  Customer spending has remained generally in line with our expectations in the first nine months of the year.  Our customers have continued to shop our stores for functional, non-discretionary items that support their lifestyle, while maintaining their focus on compelling values.  We have not altered our view on the consumer\u2019s hesitancy to make big-ticket, discretionary purchases, as we head into the fall, winter, and holiday seasons. ", "Although our performance is least dependent on big-ticket items in the fourth quarter, we have a variety of big-ticket items throughout all seasons.  Unemployment is still at a very high level and economic forecasters are projecting that unemployment will increase as we move into the fourth quarter.  While our customers appear to have some resiliency to this, we are not immune to the negative impact that unemployment has on consumer spending.  We will be cycling a 1.3% comparable sales increase in Q4 last year.  ", "Initially, this may not appear to be a tough comparison, however, this was a strong performance given the economic turmoil last year and the benefits we received from high inflation levels. As we expected, the inflationary pressures subsided in the second half of 2009 and we now estimate that the deflation could provide a headwind of approximately 2.0% in the fourth quarter.  From a weather perspective, as most of you are aware, harsh, cold winters generally will have a positive impact on sales when our insulated work wear, heating products, snow-removal, and emergency response equipment are essential for our customers.  ", "In the fourth quarter, our weather analytics provider forecasts that weather will be only slightly colder in October and slightly warmer in November and December.  We did have some storm activity at the end of last year\u2019s quarter.  We believe that the weather impact will be neutral to slightly negative.  Overall, we anticipate that we will continue to benefit from safe freight savings and reduced LIFO compared to the prior year.  However, we expect gross margins exclusive of the year-over-year favorable LIFO comparison to be flat to slightly down compared to the prior year.  ", "More specifically, with respect to gross margin, we expect some margin pressure as we move into Q4, although we will be cycling against a very heavy inflationary period last year, we believe that the most significant cost-reductions that we have negotiated have cycled through our moving average costing.  While we expect deflation in the 2.0% range in the quarter and we have proven that we can maintain retail prices and manage gross margins effectively in the current environment.  We believe that this will limit our ability to obtain the margin expansion exclusive of the LIFO impact that we experienced during the first three quarters of 2009.  We believe that the pressure on the margin will be partially offset by a favorable mix, as big-ticket sales will continue to be soft and generally big-ticket items have a lower than chain average margin.  ", "We anticipate freight will continue to have a favorable impact on margins, but less than we experienced in Q3.  Fuel prices remain well below last year\u2019s prices, and although fuel prices began to decline in the latter part of 2008, the P&L benefit was delayed as freight costs are capitalized into inventory.  Additionally, we believe that our initiative to increase the efficiency of transportation and freight will continue to gain traction.  ", "We are cycling our fourth quarter of strong shrink performance and we do not anticipate a benefit in Q4, as we had very strong results last year.  With respect to LIFO, based on our expectations for year-end inventory levels in mix, we are currently estimating a full year LIFO provision of $11.6 million, a reduction compared to our full-year estimate of $13.1 million at the end of Q2.  As you\u2019ll recall, the LIFO provision is dependent upon the combination of year-end inventory levels and mix of product, as well as the inflation rate for various product categories.  As inflation has subsided, we have continued to reduce our LIFO estimate throughout the year.  ", "To date we have been pleased with our SG&A expense management, but given our comp sales forecast, we expect that SG&A will delever in the fourth quarter.  Consistent with our approach in the second quarter, we will benefit in Q4 from negligible [telegent] costs and continued efficiency in our advertising spend.  However, we do not expect our benefit to be near the same extent as in Q2, because our fourth quarter spend historically has been significantly less than Q2.  ", "We have begun our rollout of POS system and have installed approximately 150 stores.  We will continue to incur additional payroll through early November to support this implementation.  Additionally, at the earnings level implied in our guidance, we will continue to have incentive compensation above prior year's expense consistent with the year-to-date trend.  We expect to open 76 new stores in 2009 and we have opened 58 stores year-to-date.  Additionally we have targeted 70 to 80 stores for 2010 as we continue to believe that expanding the chain at 8% to 9% is appropriate in this environment.  ", "As you all know, earlier this year we increased our long-term store count to 1,800.  We have been able to increase the ultimate potential store count, due to our research based on our knowledge of cannibalization trends, drive-time distances and further research about the Tractor Supply Company household.  While new store sales levels have been impacted by the economic downturn similar to the comp stores, our new stores in aggregate continue to meet our pro forma and internal rate of return hurdle.  We expect that capital expenditures will approximate 70 million to 75 million.  ", "In closing, we remain very pleased with our performance in a very difficult retail environment.  We are confident that our ability to execute our retail strategy and serve the functional needs of the out-here customer will be the key differentiators as we manage through the fourth quarter and head into 2010.  ", "Now I'd like to turn the call back to Jim.  ", "James F. Wright", "Thanks, Tony.  ", "As we enter the final quarter of 2009, I'd like to review the tremendous strides we\u2019ve made throughout this recessionary period to both grow and to improve our business.  Now, we recognized the downturn very early in the cycle and adjusted to the near-term realities of our business without losing sight of our long-term outlook for Tractor Supply Company.  Now more than ever, this environment has accentuated the value of our relationships with our customers, the significance of swift execution, and the critical role of our team members.  ", "Early in 2008 we developed a plan to proactively address a challenging macro environment and we then enlisted and aligned our team around that plan.  We refined our merchandising strategy as we observed our customers' changing spending behaviors.  With a more conservative mindset, consumers have dedicated their spend to nondiscretionary and to essential merchandise, deferred items that did not fit that criteria, and reduced their credit card purchases.  We saw a shift away from big ticket items while sales of basics continued on their growth trajectory.  We believe our emphasis on [Q] items and the compelling value proposition has helped to offset this pressure.  At the same time we've controlled and reduced expenses across the organization.  We recognized it would be important to find ways to cut costs as far away from the consumer as possible.  In many cases we've discovered we can do more with less.  ", "We optimized our marketing program to ensure that we were driving profitable traffic and sales with every event, and frankly, every cut in every event.  In doing so we eliminated TV costs in favor of more efficient and productive direct marketing.  We're able to track the success of this effort and ensure that it's producing the way we planned by measuring our gross margin left in that of advertising.  As I mentioned earlier, we reduced our year-end inventory for eight consecutive quarters while improving our in-stock level.  ", "We recognize that one key component of our retail engine is our people.  We did not implement a hiring freeze but instead implemented a frost to ensure that we could continue to add talent and critical roles and replace key positions.  Our team members worked hard and generated, and we granted raises and paid bonuses commensurate with their performance.  We also improved our health care program while holding costs to our team members.  We maintained our 401K match.  Through our store opening program, we created 1,600 jobs since the beginning of 2008.  We managed our balance sheet very prudently to ensure that our capital structure was solid.  We reduced our long-term debt to zero and increased cash flow from operations to fund working capital needs as we approach the peak borrowing season.  Additionally, we expanded our credit facility.  At the same time we returned approximately $65 million to our shareholders since the beginning of 2008 through our share repurchase program.  ", "Although we've slowed store expansion, we remain a growth company, and I'm delighted that we've opened more than 140 stores since the beginning of 2008.  Overall, we believe that our business has improved through this recession.  We are pleased with our earnings growth at this time.  ", "In sum, our combination of great people and prices along with unique merchandising mix has served us well.  We continue to manage our business effectively for both near and long-term.  We, through very deliberate actions and diligent planning, have achieved a great deal during this recession.  The most critically, we've made the investments to ensure success when the economy normalizes.  As we approach the holiday season, we are confident that we have the right plan in place.  We believe a conservative but nimble posture is appropriate given the level of uncertainty with consumer spending.", "As such, our gift assortment for this season will again be focused on key basics and compelling values.  This includes offering a range of gift items at mid and lower price points.  This approach was well received this year and we also believe will continue to produce sales while allowing us to limit markdown or carry-over risks as we move forward.  ", "Looking beyond 2009, we'll continue to leverage the merchandise and operational strategies that have served us well during the recession.  While we anticipate that pressure on big ticket will persist, we believe that the repair cycle will gradually swing to replacement as eventually the economics of replacement versus continued repair will shift.  The real customer will continue to be needs based and value driven for some time to come.  Nonetheless, as the authority on the rural lifestyle, we are confident that our consumers will continue to rely on Tractor Supply Company.  ", "Operator, with that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we'd like to open the call for questions.  ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)   Our first question comes from the line of Jack Murphy \u2013 William Blair.  ", "Jack Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Good afternoon.  Just a couple of questions.  Jim, wonder if you could give us a little insight into how you view the sustainability of the traffic trends that you've seen so far.  You\u2019ve obviously done a nice job through the downturn, but what initiatives you have in place for the fourth quarter and beyond that could give us a sense of the sustainability of those traffic gains.", "James F. Wright", "Sure, Jack, a couple things, probably a couple key factors.  One, as we look at the knowledge that we continue to gain and refine on customer segmentation, the number of households that we attribute customer name and address to and our increasing ability to refine our direct response marketing efforts, we believe that we'll be able to drive increased frequency of visits with existing customers as well as begin to use that media to prospect for new customers.  So I feel very good about the advertising reach.  ", "Also, as we've reported several times, our pet food, which is a high frequency business, and our large animal feed have grown now for several years at a rate exceeding that of the overall chain, yet when we look at our relative market share, it's lower.  We\u2019re pleased with our growth.  Our market share is frankly rather de minimus compared with our opportunity and we are confident that we can continue to grow those businesses.  And now that we have added the two most significant major brands of large animal feed we're very confident that we can grow that also recognizing that those customers are amongst our most valuable.", "Jack Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Great.  Just one last question - I wonder if you could just update us on your thinking in terms of the timing or potential timing of acceleration and square footage growth, how you're seeing the retail real estate market out there right now and how that might factor into your square footage plans as you look a few quarters out here?", "James F. Wright", "Yes, you bet.  Again, we've not yet seen a significant change in the space availability or pricing, somewhat on the pricing side, not significant, not a lot of change on the price of construction, however.  So the overall availability of retail sites in rural America has not changed significantly.  Obviously we are committed at this time for 2010 and our number will be in the 75 to 80 stores for next year.", "We have a little bit of time before we have to begin filling the pipeline for 2011 and at this point, I would suggest we're probably going to be at 9% growth again but reserve the right to accelerate that if we see a turn in consumer behavior and consumer confidence in the next, let's say, five to six months.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer - Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Tony, a few years ago you guys were talking a lot about the silver mile strategy in an approach to reduce your occupancy cost.  In your prepared comments you did note that your new store volumes are running in line with your plan.  But could you remind us how your budgeting first year sales with the silver mile strategy compared to the gold mile strategy?  And then also in terms of are we seeing the benefits in reducing occupancy expenses that you were anticipating?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes, a couple points on that, Dan, and then I can turn it over to Stan for any other additional comments.  But generally when it comes to sales the differential between the golden mile and the silver mile is not significant.  So we did not anticipate either a decline or an increase in the sales level for store.", "The sales level for store generally is driven by the location of the stores.  And in some areas of the country they're going to be a little bit lower sales volumes, other areas there'll be higher sales volumes.  So that really is more the driver than the silver and the golden mile.", "Relative to the silver and golden mile, the silver mile we would expect to have lower costs and we have seen that as we've had a shift to the silver mile from, I believe we were up to about 60% or lower, I guess, when it came to the silver mile and shifting to the silver miles.  We have seen an expense reduction.  Stan, if you wanted to add any points to that.", "Stanley L. Ruta", "I think you covered very well, Tony.  We did quite a bit of analysis before we really started focusing on the silver mile and at that time, Dan, really didn't see any significant difference in store volumes in the markets we served.  Of course, usually the smaller markets, the distance between the golden mile and the silver mile is just across town or down the road.  So it continues to be a good strategy for us.  It's helping us maintain good store growth at a reduced cost.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Can I just have a follow-up question, if I could?  I think that you noted that suddenly the pet food prices were actually increasing year-over-year.  Was that at the wholesale level to you or Tractor being able to push through the price increases on pet food?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "This is Greg.  Dan, it is a combination of really the prices holding in some cases or slightly becoming elevated and us literally as we've always done kind of move with the market as the cost would increase.", "We're not seeing a real deflation yet in pet food.  And that's something that we're watching closely.  But there have been some slight increases.  We've taken advantage of those and moved with the market.  And we also, with you, anticipate the first half of the year possible some prices coming down.  But we really just don't know at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Higgenbotham - Goldman Sachs.", "Robert Higgenbotham - Goldman Sachs", "I wanted to dig into gross margin a little bit.  And Tony touched on much of this.  But I\u2019m hoping for some incremental color.  When you talked to the third quarter performance, you broke out the 70 bips of impact from freight, certainly a big number.  The overall FIFO margin was up nearly 200 basis points.  I'm wondering if you can help us quantify or at least sort of bucket those other two factors between better markdown performance and vendor support.", "James F. Wright", "Yes, Robert.  Basically what we've seen is - and from our internal reporting we break these out and why I try not to get too granular when it comes to the specific break outs is because a lot of times you allocate either vendor support or promotions or discounts as part of the direct margin.  And so I try not to get too granular as far as how we break that out.", "Generally the initial margin, purchase price margin was probably about 20 basis points less.  And we saw generally in those categories of volume support or rebate again improvements in sort of the 10 to 20 basis point range.", "And then as far as we can best quantify markdown management, there is probably somewhere between the 70 to 80-basis point improvement there.  So hopefully that gives you some sense of the magnitude of the various categories that we're talking about.  But, again, between freight and the management markdowns how you allocate that to your direct margin can be a little bit subjective.  But for the most part, those are your three key components.", "Robert Higgenbotham - Goldman Sachs", "Understood.  That is actually very helpful.  And on mix shift was there no positive mix impact?  I kind of would have thought that to the extent that you had lower sales of your alternative heating products, which I imagine would have lower margins, that you would have seen some positive impact there.  Is that not correct?", "James F. Wright", "Yes.  Interesting, as far as mix goes we actually had a negative impact.  And a lot of that is a result of the shift to some of our consumables in the feed line that have just a slightly lower-than-chain-average margin.  But we were doing some significantly higher volumes.  So in this case we had a negative impact when it came to mix, which I would agree with you is a little counterintuitive to the impact that normally the slowness in the large-ticket items would prevail.", "Robert Higgenbotham - Goldman Sachs", "And lastly, on your comments around 4Q margins, did I understand you correctly to say that you're expecting a net decline in FIFO gross margins in the fourth quarter?", "James F. Wright", "I said - yes, I said flat to slightly negative.", "Robert Higgenbotham - Goldman Sachs", "And - I'm sorry.  I may have interrupted.", "James F. Wright", "No, I was just saying on an ex LIFO basis or a FIFO basis we are looking to flat or slightly down.", "Robert Higgenbotham - Goldman Sachs", "", "Right.  And I guess I understand that you may have cycled through your average cost of inventory from your biggest price negotiations.  It still seems like year-over-year though that you would see some further benefit from that.  I might be missing something.", "James F. Wright", "Again, a lot of it has to do with the mix and looking at the mix and the way it's been trending as well as the management of those price decreases that we've attained and how much we've passed on to the customer, etc cetera.  So but based on our forecasting we're looking at a FIFO basis of flat to slightly down.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent [Senisey] - Bank of America.", "Vincent [Senisey] - Bank of America", "", "Yes, first question, regarding your outlook for 4Q deflation you said potentially you think there could be 2% worth of deflationary headwinds in the quarter.  Just wondering if you can give, Tony, a breakdown there by category, if that is strictly taking into account the livestock feed and the fencing you had mentioned or if there is anything else in there.", "James F. Wright", "The categories I mentioned initially that were deflationary were two of the larger categories that would drive this inflation for the most part.  Other than that, we don\u2019t provide too much guidance and some of it is speculative as to directionally where it could be headed.  We basically will take a look at what our current pricing is and try to extrapolate that as to where we see the pricing going at year end.  But we believe that overall given what prices were last year, looking at it on a year over year basis that we would expect to have some deflationary pressure.  ", "Vincent [Senisey] - Bank of America", "Okay, then just one quick follow-up, if I may, your CapEx came down minimally only about $5 million.  Is that just strictly timing, or is there anything else in there?", "James F. Wright", "A combination of timing and obviously a good portion relates to our store expansion program and those expenses came in a bit less than we anticipated as well.  But the majority relate to the timing of some projects that are getting pushed into 2010.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities", "My first question is around the branded feed product introduction, when did that actually find its way into stores and is that increase margin per bag or is it designed to drive new customers?  What is the thinking behind that?", "James F. Wright", "", "Sure.  Well, Greg why don\u2019t you take that.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Matt, it went in around the early part of October, officially around the 10th would be the date and to be honest with you, as we went in with the pricing structure against this, it was very similar to what you would find at local markets so there really wasn\u2019t any margin gain out of this.  It was pretty much typical to what you would find in our relative margins across other feed, so no great margin gain here.  This was a strategy to go acquire new customers.", "Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities", "All right.  Maybe then you can just give us a quick update on additional product launches or merchandising initiatives we should look for towards the end of this year or early next year.  ", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "First of all, the wraparound of branded feed as it goes into the first part of next year is going to be a big plus. And secondly, I would say the fourth quarter from a merchandise execution strategy on gifting and on the positioning of product throughout the store targeted toward a usable gift is\u2026 We have taken a much stronger stance on this than we did last year as I mentioned earlier, it worked well for us.  This year, we believe it will work even better.  I would tell you that we have also repositioned the location in the store where this product is going to be found.  It is now down the center court where a year ago it was up in the left hand corner in what we call the seasonal area.  This year, that positioning is for all heating and for what we call warm wear products.  So we are feeling very good about how the fourth quarter should translate to sale on seasonal products.", "Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities", "", "In turning to the balance sheet, quickly, your cash balance, I think is at or close to a record high.  You didn\u2019t draw down on your revolver which would be sort of typical for this time of year.  What do you expect in terms of cash build and your philosophy into deploying that back into shared purchase?", "James F. Wright", "", "Currently, we look at the shared purchase program and again, each quarter we will look at our matrix and will fine tune the matrix relative to some internal calculations that we do around the share pricing.  As you may sense, the stock price had a nice movement throughout the quarter and therefore, moved away from the matrix which we had established so that the purchases were minimal.  We will continue to look at how to deploy the cash.  ", "We have set targets internally as far as what we would like to maintain as our cash balances.  We are slowly approaching those targets and as we move into 2010, we will continue to look at alternatives as far as returning cash either to our shareholders or deploying it in what we believe are the most efficient growth potentials.  We will be able to provide more clarity as we move into 2010 and give guidance on the 2010 forecast P&L and balance sheet.", "Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities", "", "Okay, if I could just sneak one more quick one in, can you just give us an update on the point of sale system and all that?", "James F. Wright", "", "Yes, Matt.  Point of sale is, as Tony mentioned earlier, right now, we have got it at about 174 stores.  We are going to stop at 174 for this year.  We are going to focus on fourth quarter business and right after the first of the year, we are going to start rolling the POS out to the rest of the company.  The feedback from our stores has been extremely favorable on the system in the 174 stores that we have rolled it out to in all phases.  It\u2019s initial feedback is a big win for the stores and for our customers and we plan on having a full roll out completed by the end of queue one of 2010.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray.", "Analyst for Mitch Kaiser \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "I\u2019m calling in for Mitch.  I wanted to follow up a little bit on Robert\u2019s gross margin question.  I apologize if it is repetitive, but just to make sure I fully understand.  On the financial margins, you do expect some small benefit from freight and mix, but then is it the impact from the average inventory costing will more than offset that so that you think it will be flat and slightly down?", "James F. Wright", "", "Yes, that is one of the drivers and I also mentioned that we do not anticipate having the same performance in shrink as we had on a year over year basis last year.  So that will be a tough comparison for us and again, as we move in\u2026 and some of the promotional\u2026 we are a little uncertain as to the promotional environment.  So we will look at that as far as the fourth quarter.  But we feel that on the direct margin, again, you have to look at the year over year comparison and look at some of the categories in the mix.  But potentially, that would be one of the drivers as far as pulling down the margin relative to the two anticipated drivers as far as improvement in the margin which is freight.  Obviously, being the lead candidate there.", "Analyst for Mitch Kaiser \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay.  And is that, does that dynamic now starting in Q4, is that something that we might continue to expect in some of the quarters in early 2010?", "James F. Wright", "", "Well, we feel very confident that we can continue to manage in a low inflationary or low deflationary environment.  Again, it is a matter of how those costs cycle though.  When we get to cost savings in a deflationary period, and how we can manage our pricing.  Clearly, if the retail price is maintained, and have a certain stickiness to it, it gives us an opportunity for those costs to move through our costing and therefore, we have a better matching of the costs and the retail price to maintain the margin.  So, again, several variables, but we believe that as we have shown in the first three quarters that we can mange through a low inflationary and to a certain extent, a deflationary period as well.", "Analyst for Mitch Kaiser \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "All right, okay.  That helps.  Then, one unrelated question, but we haven\u2019t heard much about it apparel.  I know you\u2019re moving into apparel heavy Q4 with some of the outerwear.  Would you update us with any trends that you are seeing there at this point?  ", "James F. Wright", "", "Yeah.  Peter, I failed to mention in some of the fourth quarter initiatives, the rollout that we started in third quarter of CE Schmidt For Her which has been very, very positive.  We also are seeing some early solid indications that the cold weather products insulated and the boots and such cold weather gear is going to perform well.  We have our inventories in great shape.  They are fresh inventories, no carry-over from a year ago.  So we are very bullish on that and I think that we really structured in apparel, more of a price point program for this fall and that is also benefitting us.  The consumer really relates to, I hate to say this, but item price.  We are very much a key item [inaudible] ", "START FILE 6", "sat on the floor right now and it is working very well for us.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristin [Applegee] - Sun Trust Robinson.", "Kristin [Applegee] - Sun Trust Robinson", "You said earlier that you expect the big-ticket items to remain under pressure.  And I was wondering if you expect the recovery there, the shift from repair back to replace to basically be in line with whatever happens in the macro economy.", "James F. Wright", "Well, I think we have to recognize that there is - that consumer behavior and the declared end of the recession are likely to be decoupled.  Consumers continue to deleverage their balance sheets.  They continue to be credit adverse.  They continue to save.  And as we know, every dollar that goes into debt reduction or savings is a dollar that does not go into retail.", "So I think we are going to have to wait and see but I do think that the discretionary spender, big-ticket spender probably lag the official end of the recession.  Eventually it'll come back.  Eventually the consumers repair capital goods cannot be repaired forever.  At some point that one actually becomes more economical to replace over term.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless - FTN Equity.", "Jay McCanless - FTN Equity", "Two questions - first one, on the 5.9% transaction increase year-over-year, could you all talk about how much of that is actually boots coming into the store versus people ordering online?  Just wanted to see if you're actually pulling people in or they're taking advantage of all the internet promotions and email promotions I've seen.", "James F. Wright", "Yes, that's all store traffic.  That's the same-store foot traffic, actually, same-store transactions, not traffic, transactions.", "Jay McCanless - FTN Equity", "And then my other question on - with the increases we've seen since the beginning of the quarter in oil prices and some of the other commodities am I reading it correctly with the way you're capitalizing those input costs now that we won't see any affect in Q4 if oil prices and grain prices sort of keep going up but we might see some pressure in fiscal '10?  Is that the right way to think about it?", "James F. Wright", "", "Generally since our turns are close to three it could take four months on average for the cost to cycle through, the inventory costing, so the freight cost matching up with the turns.  Now obviously the turns are different for various categories, so some of it may be accelerated through.  So some of it could impact a little bit earlier.  But generally, on average, you're looking at sort of a three to four-month lag when it comes to the oil prices impacting freight and subsequently the P&L through the inventory capitalization.", "Jay McCanless - FTN Equity", "Have you all seen anything?  I know you talked a little bit about deflation.  I'm guessing that's lagging from earlier this year.  But have you all seen any other or new recent price increases from any of your vendors or anything you didn't expect in the way of coming price increases?", "James F. Wright", "No, we have not, to be honest with you.  We continue to challenge the vendor community to bring prices back down.  And we've been for the most part successful in that.  It's been - they've been receptive.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Strasser - Janney Montgomery.", "David Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott", "I was kind of a little bit looking at sort of the mix of sales as it relates debit versus credit.  Are you seeing any incremental, I guess, refusals at the register?  Is that having an impact on the bigger ticket?  And how are you thinking about that going forward?", "James F. Wright", "", "Yes, generally what we're seeing is that the applications themselves have declined and that is because the consumer just isn't looking to make that big-ticket purchase.  The declines that we're actually getting from the credit company generally is just slightly less but it's not something that is overly significant.  So what we're seeing is that people just generally are not applying for the credit.", "David Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott", "I mean, so when they're - because people who are applying - but inside the store, I guess, as it relates to the credit cards, you're not seeing anything incremental or mixed towards cash.  It's more just people not buying the stuff or applying as opposed to a mix towards cash away from credit.", "James F. Wright", "Yes, when we look at sort of the cash/debit mix we see that cash/debit/check has increased year-to-date about 130 basis points.", "David Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott", "How significant a number is that?  Like, do you think of that, is that something that you step back and say, wow, or is that something that's more just maybe just kind of not a big deal to you?", "James F. Wright", "It's not overly dramatic especially in light of the trend that debit had prior to the economic situation.  So we saw significant movement towards debit and that continued.  However, the movement to cash and check has increased and that had gone in the other direction prior to.  So we definitely see the consumer being more conservative and only spending what he has in his pocket.", "David Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott", "One other clarification, I'm sorry, but when you were talking about some new grounds on the pet side having Purina.", "James F. Wright", "Purina and Nutrena, they're both within the livestock side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christian Buss - Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Christian Buss - Thomas Weisel Partners", "You'd mentioned the deleverage impact from newer stores on the SG&A.  Could you help us quantify what that was?", "James F. Wright", "I could probably help you quantify it but we generally don\u2019t give that type of directional information.  As in the past few years, we know that the real estate and to a certain extent some of the payroll new stores, until those stores reach maturity those stores will have a deleveraging impact.", "We felt that through - as we moved into 2010 that that would become a much - that difference would moderate and probably be in the 20 to 25-basis point range and that we could eventually overcome that with our other SG&A management.  With a negative comp sales, that obviously becomes more exaggerated.  So in a range you're probably looking somewhere between sort of the 15 to 40 basis point range at any given time depending on the comp sales volume.", "Christian Buss - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And maybe a follow-up there, is there any way you can help us gauge the hurdle for new stores as a percent of revenue at that 9% store growth rate that you guys have slowed to, sort of what the hurdle is there to hit the inner targets?", "James F. Wright", "I'm having a hard time translating the question.  When we look at a particular store, it doesn't necessarily matter what the sales level is.  It's obviously the whole economics of the box itself.  So we'll be looking at it over a 10-year period and we'll do a discounted cash flow for that 10-year period.", "So a store, depending on its cost structure, could be very successful at $2.2 million or very successful at $4.4 million.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan.", "Christopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan", "Tony, can you talk about how the markdown management benefit trended over the past four quarters?  You had mentioned it was roughly 70, 80 basis points this quarter.  I'm curious if 4Q is just a tough compare in spite of it sounding like being stronger on seasonal is more a comparison issue versus the execution.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Well, it's probably a little of both.  It has built throughout the course of the year.  Some of it - again, I think we need to go back to some o the history but Greg joined us near the end of 2007, so his first year coming through in 2008, we started to experience the improved inventory management and obviously cycling through some of our older goods and moving those out.  So the freshness of the inventory really had a significant impact and as we continue to cycle that is really when we started to show the benefit, so obviously the cycle year-over-year 2009 compared to his first quarter 2008 had less of an impact and as we continue to show that improvement throughout his tenure, we continue to be able to improve that markdown management focus.  So, there has been a slight improvement from a sustainability standpoint.  I believe that we can continue, but not necessarily at the pace that we saw in the third quarter, but we believe that there will be some benefit as we move into Q4.  ", "", "Christopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan", "So, that 70 or 80 basis points sticks, it\u2019s just that some of the cycling shrink of a year ago and some of the vendor allowance dollars; that\u2019s the tough compare, not necessarily the mark down management.  Is that fair?", "", "Anthony F. Crudele", "I think as we move into Q4, that\u2019s a fair statement.  The benefit on the mark down management may not be to the extent that it was in Q3, but we do believe that we will be able to have enhanced performance on a year-over-year basis.  ", "", "Christopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan", "And then on the freight side, you turn inventories three times per year, so for freight to have 70 basis point improvement in the quarter being the biggest of the year, that is a little counterintuitive, so perhaps [inaudible] the driver there and is it some of the supply chain effort coming thorough in driving that and why is that not sustainable in the 4Q?", "", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Clearly we will have a benefit in Q4.  We just don\u2019t think it will be to the extent of the 73 basis points, but we do believe that it will be substantial.  As we cycle through and compare to last year, we did have very high costs in the summertime months and the majority of that did cycle through in the fourth quarter, so we believe that we will have some significant benefit there.  But, as gas prices have increased, obviously, throughout this year we may not have the benefit that we had in Q3.  But, you are correct, on a year-over-year basis, freight expense was very high last year coming into the fourth quarter.  So, we will have some substantial benefits, we just believe it will be slightly less than the 73 basis points we experienced in Q3.", "", "Christopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan", "Then, all told, ex LIFO, you are thinking that the direct margins are going to be down 60 to 70 basis points and freight comes in plus 50, ballpark, directionally.", "", "Anthony F. Crudele", "I don\u2019t believe the initials will be down as significantly as that.  I think it will be less than that as far as initial margins.  Again, it\u2019s a matter of how you allocate the promotional dollars, as well.  But net net, the big eternal will be the shrink.  And we believe that, obviously, the markdown managements will be a positive contributor.  But, when it comes to the initial margin, net of the discounts, we are probably looking at more the 20 or 30 basis point level.", "", "Christopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan", "Down?", "", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Down, correct.", "", "Christopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan", "And then finally, if I could just sneak one in, you hear a lot of, like, the apparel retailers; even some home furnishings guys, seeing some renewed, maybe pent-up demand on big ticket.  Just curious, if as the quarter progressed or even into October, if you saw any signs of life on the big ticket side of the mix.", "", "James F. Wright", "I think we have to temper what we are hearing from certain retail sectors against how far they fell last year.  So, they are seeing improvement on a year-over-year basis, but their rate of decline, I guess, in Q3, certainly Q4, last year was much more severe than ours was.  So, I guess the answer is no, we are not anticipating any significant improvement on trend for ourselves.", "", "Christopher Horvers - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you very much.", "", "James F.

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that the reproduction of this call in whole or in part is not permitted without prior written authorization of Tractor Supply Company and as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded.  I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Ms. Cara O\u2019Brien of Financial Dynamics.  Please go ahead.", "Cara O\u2019Brien - Financial Dynamics", "Thank you, Operator.  Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today.

Jim, please go ahead.  ", "James F. Wright", "Thank you, Cara.  Good afternoon, everyone.  I\u2019m here today with Tony Crudele, our CEO, Stan Ruda, EVP of Store Operations and Greg Sandfort, our new EVP of Merchandising.", "First I\u2019d like to turn briefly to our performance during the fourth quarter.  Although the macro environment continued to pose challenges with our results for the quarter, we were able to grow traffic in our stores and better manage our inventory levels.  As a result, total sales grew by 15% to $723 million while same-store sales grew at 3.8%.  This top line growth drove our earnings per share 7% higher to $0.77 per share.  ", "I\u2019m proud of the efforts from our store and store support teams in our important fourth quarter.  Their hard work ensured that our stores were fully stocked, well displayed, and our customers were both greeted and served.  Our sales increase for the fourth quarter was primarily driven by our core lifestyle merchandise, including animal health and pet supplies, as well as many of our winter-related merchandise categories including footwear, snow removal, heating, and related wood-burning and wood cutting products.  In several categories, our sales and inventory forecasting matched demand very well.  In others we implemented a markdown cadence and accelerated some promotions to hit our inventory targets.  With this plan in place, we were able to achieve normalized inventory levels and to begin reversing the trend of average inventory per store.  Tony will provide more color on that later in the call.  ", "During the review of the full year, we successfully anticipated a very dynamic retail environment and while the consumer was pressured and uneasy throughout the year, we achieved sales growth of 14% and comps of 3.4%.  To provide more details behind the drivers of our success in 2007, I\u2019ll go over some of the accomplishments for the year.  I was pleased with our overall performance in the stores on many different levels.  We steadily grew our business and ended the year with 764 stores.  We expanded our geographic reach and entered new markets such as Louisiana, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and New Mexico with a total of 10 stores while opening 73 new stores in existing Tractor Supply states.  As has been our history, our new stores are producing sales and profit on plan.  Additionally, we reached our new store opening target for Del\u2019s which was 6 new stores this year, opening our first store in eastern Washington, and an additional store in Oregon during the year allowed us to begin testing this concept in markets outside of Del\u2019s brand awareness reach and in markets where locally grown hay is plentiful.", "We continued our merchandising efforts to ensure that we\u2019re offering our customers the best selection and mix to serve their \u201cout here\u201d lifestyle.  By the end of 2007, 565 of our stores had the expanded apparel resets.  All of our stores had the enhanced animal and pet merchandise.  These [skews] benefited our comp performance throughout the year.  Our 41 high line test stores produced a 2 month look at category and formats performance.  We had some wins, we had some disappointments, and some categories where we simply need more time to evaluate. Our plans are to roll out the best items and best categories to plan as the year progresses and we are confident that we will benefit from the rollout and not have to incur the full capital or operating expense of the extensive reset activity that we undertook in the test stores.  The 41 test stores, meanwhile, will continue to serve as our hard line laboratory.", "We also made great progress on our customer relationship management initiative this year.  We\u2019ve been able to match the profile of our existing customers to potential customers that share those same attributes.  As a result of our successful direct mail task and developing expertise, we will re-allocate our advertising spend in 2008.  We\u2019ll move more to direct mail which will allow us to effectively reach our most important customers with the right offer and at the right time.  We continue to use television to support and build brand awareness for Tractor Supply Company.  ", "As planned, we launched our e-commerce website in the fourth quarter.  During the holiday season we received a very positive reaction to our e-commerce offering and we see significant potential as we expand the product and content offered.  I will go into \u201908 plans for e-commerce later in the call. ", "We\u2019ve proven our capacity to grow the chain at 13% to increase earnings and to position the company for the long term. While new store occupancy has caused the [due] leveraging of SG&A during the last 7 years, we made progress in 2007.  New stores improved in Q4 and throughout \u201907 and have a lower occupancy cost as a percent of sales than stores opened in recent years.  As a result, we\u2019ll see the de-leveraging for occupancy costs reduced in half in 2008 and expect occupancy costs to increase at a lower rate again in 2009.  We\u2019ve included our fist year of applying lean principals which we call TVS to our store support center processes and opened two new value strings.  We believe that TVS is a tool that will enhance our efforts to reduce cost and waste.  ", "At the Board level, we have placed several new directors throughout the year.  George MacKenzie, John Adams, and Rick Frost have provided additional strength to our Board and most recently Bill Bass was appointed Director earlier this month.  We\u2019ve added experts in the areas of e-commerce, merchandising, procurement, logistics, specialty retail, and in finance.  The expertise brought by our new Board members matches very well and complimented that of our existing Board members.  Further, as many of you know, we completed our long plan succession plan when Joe Scarlett was named Chairman Emeritus in November.  In addition to thanking Joe for his years of dedication to our company, I\u2019d also like to thank Sam Reed and Joe Maxwell who departed from our Board in 2007 for their contributions both to our Board and to our company over the years.", "In summary, this was a year not without challenges.  I\u2019m pleased with our achievements in 2007 and am enthusiastic about the opportunities in 2008 and certainly over the long term.  We continue to make investments in our infrastructure, in our stores, and in our people.", "I\u2019d like now to turn the call over to Tony to review the financial performance and to discuss our outlook for this year. ", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Thanks, Jim.  Good afternoon, everyone.  We don\u2019t generally navigate through tough retail environment in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re very pleased with our results.  We achieved key goals of driving double digit sales growth through both increased transactions and average ticket while managing our inventory increase well below our sales increase.  Sales for the fourth quarter ended December 29, 2007 increased 14.8% to $723.3 million compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter sales.  The total comp sales for the period were 3.8%.  Non-comp sales were approximately $84.3 million or 11.7% of sales.  ", "As we discussed in our Q3 conference call, sales were soft in October as a result of unseasonably warm weather.  As the colder weather rolled in during November, we recouped the October sales shortfall and the month of November had the strongest comp increase within the quarter.  Sales comp sales were below the company average as a result of warmer and wetter conditions in the northwest which negatively impacted seed and hay sales. We estimate that the cannibalization impact on comp sales was approximately 80 basis points which is consistent with our expectations.  ", "With respect to regional sales trends, comp sales were the strongest in the northern states, buoyed by the colder year-over-year trends as was consistent from east to the midwest.  Sales were the weakest in the southeast where moisture levels remained low and were negatively impacted by the weak Florida economy.  We continue to grow our customer traffic with comp transaction counts up 2.7% for the quarter.  This is driven by the strength and continued growth of our core consumable business.  Average ticket on a comp basis increased by approximately 100 basis points.  Although we still see softness in spending on larger ticket items, it was a less significant decrease than previous quarters and the mix of the large ticket items has less of an impact in Q4 as rider sales were not as significant in the fourth quarter as they are in the second and third quarters. ", "Gross margin improved by 10 basis points.  Our direct margin rate improved through better buying and increased imports. On a year-over-year basis for the quarter, import purchases increased from 7% to 8% of cost purchases and for the full year, imports rose to approximately 7.1% up from the 4.4% at this time last year.  This trend is tracking favorably towards our long term target of 13% of sales.  Our improved gross margins were partially offset by slight increase in shrink and freight.  Freight expense increased 16 basis points compared to the prior year quarter as a result of the increase in imports and a greater than 25% increase in diesel fuel prices in the fourth quarter.", "SG&A including depreciation as a percent of sales was 25.6%, an 80 basis point increase from the same quarter in the prior year.  The de-leveraging resulted principally from payroll and occupancy from new stores that have lower sales volumes than the mature store base.  We opened 26 stores and relocated one store in the fourth quarter compared to 18 store openings in the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter.  For the year we opened a total of 89 stores compared to 82 for 2006.  ", "We continue to make progress on our real estate strategy to position the company to leverage occupancy expense as we continue our expansion.  For future stores approved in the fourth quarter, occupancy as a percent of sales improved by 40 basis points versus the stores approved at this time last year and that is after cycling the implementation of our current strategies from last year.  As we prepare our detailed 2008 plan, it is apparent that these initiatives have taken hold and that the real estate costs will begin to moderate in 2008.", "Now turning to the balance sheet, on a per-store basis, inventory levels excluding Del\u2019s decreased approximately 5.2% at the end of the quarter.  Our calculation is based on average cost of inventory and excludes in-transit inventory and inventory held at unopen stores.  In-transit inventory at the end of the quarter increased to $24.9 million compared to $17.9 million in the prior year as a result of imports and in-transit domestic purchases.  We also showed improvements in our terms for the quarter which improved 6 basis points year-over-year as we better managed inventory and took advantage of the increased foot steps.  The full year term was down 7 basis points. We believe that several of our actions to improve inventory productivity are beginning to gain traction.  This includes better exit strategies on one-time special buys, a focused approach on new store inventory levels, and less productive inventory and more rigorous training program on our E3 inventory management software.  We believe that although we\u2019ve made significant strides this past quarter, this will be an ongoing effort as we continue to be more productive with our inventory.  Greg Sandfort is tasked with heading up this initiative and we expect Greg and the merchandising team to continue to make progress in this area going forward. ", "We experienced an increase in accounts payable financing of our inventory from approximately 37.3% up to 38.3% resulting principally from better accounts payable management and vendor dating.  Given the increase in imports, we are satisfied with the progress we are making.  ", "-------------------", "Capital expenditures for the year were approximately 84 million which was significantly below our planned expenditures of approximately $100 million.  Because we conservatively managed our capital in the quarter, we spent less capital than forecasted on new stores planned to open in the fourth quarter as well as in early 2008 and we pushed some IT projects into 2008.  I\u2019ll talk a little bit more about planned CapEx for 2008 in a moment.  ", "During the fourth quarter we repurchased 1.35 million shares for a total of $55.1 million under our stock repurchase program.  For the year we repurchased a total of 3.2 million shares totaling $150 million.  We estimate that the share repurchase program benefited earnings by $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter.  We currently have approximately $50 million remaining under our current stock repurchase program.  Subject to prevailing market conditions, we expect to continue to make additional purchases as part of our long term objective of reducing our cost of capital.  ", "Looking at 2008, for the full year we anticipate sales to range between $3.01 billion and $3.08 billion, an 11% to 14% increase over 2007.  Our top line guidance reflects an expected comp store sales increase of approximately 1% to 3%.  We expect the impact of cannibalization in 2008 to range between 70 and 90 basis points.  We expect full year 2008 net income to be in a range of approximately $98.5 million to $101.5 million or $2.54 to $2.62 per diluted share.  We expect [even] margin to decrease 35 to 40 basis points for 2008.  While we anticipate expansion of gross margin profit from our merchandise initiatives, we expect de-leveraging of SG&A expenses as a result of our store expansion program and limited comp sales growth.  ", "We anticipate that gross margin will increase through increased imports and private label offerings and price optimization.  Additionally, we expect the increase in fuel prices to be less dramatic, particularly in the second half of the year.  Although we believe that our gross margin initiatives will continue to be beneficial, we anticipate a tough retail environment that will not be tolerant of retail price increases.  We also continue to be aggressive in moving clearance merchandise as part of our inventory reduction strategies during the course of the year.  With comp sales anticipated to be less robust within this retail environment, it will be more difficult to leverage our SG&A as we continue our commitment to grow our store base 13% annually.  Occupancy costs and to a lesser extent payroll has had a de-leveraging impact that will continue until the new stores reach maturity.  We have executed several initiatives to drive down the occupancy cost as part of our efforts to be more efficient with our capital.  ", "We are very optimistic about the overall performance of our new stores.  In fact, 2007 store group has outperformed the prior 2 years new stores when comparing annualized first year operating profit results.  As we previously forecasted, we are beginning to see this de-leveraging moderate in 2008.  We expect stock option expense to increase to approximately $14.5 million or $0.23 per share which provides an SG&A head wind.  This represents an increase of approximately $4.2 million or $0.04 to $0.05 per share over 2007.  This results principally from the incremental expense of the 2008 stock option awards with essentially no roll off of previous year grants, some of which were on a different vesting cycle than the current program.  There were no changes to the structure of the stock option plan this year.  We expect that we will leverage our marketing, field management, distribution centers, and corporate overhead expenses in 2008; however, we will cycle against 2007, a year against which we fell below our internal plan and the incentive compensation payout was limited.  Therefore, we do not anticipate obtaining any leverage from these areas as we forecast a more normalized incentive comp expense for 2008.  ", "We forecast that effective tax rate will increase to 38.5% fro 37.9%.  This results principally from changes in state tax laws that we estimate will increase our tax burden.  For 2008 we plan to open approximately 95 to 100 stores including 8 to 10 Del\u2019s stores.  We expect that approximately 50% of the stores will be opened in the first half of the year which is similar to the store opening strategy executed in 2007.  We do not anticipate relocating any stores in 2008. ", "Total capital expenditures are expected to range between $100 million and $105 million, a $20 million increase over 2007 CapEx budget results principally from an $11 million expansion of our Waco distribution facility, additional new store capital required as we continue our initiative to shift our mix of new stores from build to suit to second use real estate, and some of the IT initiatives that we shifted from 2007 to 2008.  In addition to the $100 million to $105 million we have earmarked an additional $20 million of capital for new store site acquisition and development.  This program will be executed on a site by site basis, with the objective of lowering our overall occupancy costs while improving our return on invested capital.", "Although we anticipate making further purchases under our stock repurchase program pursuant to prevailing market conditions, we do not include potential future repurchases in our forecasts.  As we\u2019ve emphasized in the past, we believe our business can be more accurately assessed by looking at the halfs, not the quarters, as the weather can significantly change and shift the timing of our sales.  I would like to remind you that our results were unusually strong in the first quarter of 2007.  This will provide a difficult comparison for results in the first quarter of 2008 which we expect to be a more normalized get ready quarter for us.  Based on our weather forecasting service, we anticipate March and April to be more seasonally normal than in 2007 which would suggest some sales shifting form Q1 into Q2 this year since April was unseasonably cool last year.  We expect to experience some margin pressure in the first quarter but we anticipate margin growth in the second, third, and fourth quarters as we progress on our 2008 initiatives. ", "Additionally, keep in mind that we have one less comp day in the first quarter as we are closed on Easter which shifts to March this year instead of April. Consistent with prior eyras, we look at the second and fourth quarters as our most productive quarters as well as where we anticipate having the most opportunity for earnings improvement versus the prior year. As in the past, any quarterly conference call we will provide more color on our expectations for the subsequent period.  ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jim for more details on our plans for 2008.", "James F. Wright", "Thanks, Tony.  Looking to 2008 and beyond, we\u2019ll be resolute in our efforts to continue growing our business.  Although we are being prudent to ensure we manage our business appropriately given the current retail environment, we are confident that we have the right strategies in place to continue building a solid foundation for future growth and ensuring that we are the authority and the store choice for those living the \u201cout here\u201d lifestyle.  ", "Before discussing our priorities for this year, I\u2019d like to remind you of our four stated long-term strategic objectives for growth.  First we expect to grow sales by maintaining our commitment to our overall in-store experience.  To support this, we\u2019ll grow our units at 13% a year, improve our store performance by increasing traffic and tickets, and as to merchandise mix, focus on service and season advice and implement our multi channel strategy.  Second, we\u2019ll continue to grow our operating profit margin as a result of increasing our direct imports, our private and controlled brands through optimization and through SG&A leverage over time.  Third, we expect to grow profit from our core households by increasing market share of our closely targeted households and developing our CRM capacity to provide for a single view of our customers across all channels.  Lastly, we expect to grow our return on invested capital.  This will be driven by improving our inventory turnover, our vendor inventory float, and improving our capital utilization.  Those four initiatives best position Tractor Supply for a bright future, but more immediately we are focused on ensuring that our 2008 objectives complement our long term agenda and advance our growth.", "First there are opportunities to grow business by maintaining our store expansion program, by refining our merchandise selection, and building out our e-commerce offering.  Our stores and their merchandise are the corner of our business. We expect to open 95 to 100 stores including 8 to 10 Del\u2019s stores this year.  We\u2019ll continue to find ways to increase sales within our existing stores by changes to our merchandise assortments and presentation.  As the changes in apparel and animal health and pet departments have or will continue to contribute to our sales growth, we believe the next opportunity is with the hard line merchandise that we\u2019ve been testing and refining.  ", "We\u2019re also expecting to improve the merchandising and productivity of our end caps, our seasonal mass areas, and our front end.  We\u2019ll complement our in-store strategy by continuing to develop our e-commerce initiative.  We expect sales to ramp up throughout 2008 so we will begin leveraging e-commerce in 2009.  We\u2019ll also continue to develop the next phases of our integrated multi channel strategy throughout 2008.  Phase 2 will allow us to become more efficient at handling special orders within our stores by creating the capacity to order merchandise online and pick it up in our stores or order an tem in the store and have it delivered to our customer\u2019s home.  ", "In Phase 3 we\u2019ll create a series of specialty catalogs that are focused around the special interests that make up the \u201cout here\u201d lifestyle.  Ultimately we believe the strategy will allow us to generate store traffic, improve our inventory management, and to tailor some of our in-store service.  Secondly we believe that there are certain areas of our business that will be improved by implementing new merchandise initiatives, refining our CRM capacity, and reducing our real estate and occupancy costs.  In the near term we expect to continue refining our CRM strategy.  We did a good job of gathering data on our customers in 2007 and now as we shift our advertising spend toward more targeted direct mail, we expect a solid execution of strategy will allow us to efficiently begin reaching our most important customers with product and promotional messages they find compelling.  ", "Bringing our real estate and occupancy costs in line will continue to be a key driver for improving our SG&A margins going forward.  We are tightly managing the build out costs of our new stores through value engineering.  We successfully increased the mix of second use locations versus build to suit.  They perform just as well and are more efficient.  We are now benefiting from stores located at the silver mile versus the gold mile due to lower land costs and equal sales performance.  ", "The new merchandise initiatives that will be focused on in 2008 I will be implementing price optimization strategy, improving our inventory management, and accelerating our strategic direct sourcing and proprietary brands strategy.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Greg Sandfort, our new Chief Merchandising Officer, to elaborate on these merchandising initiatives and discuss some of his initial observations.  Greg\u2019s already become a very valuable member of our team. He has a terrific history with over 30 years in the department store and specialty retailing management experience.  Throughout his career he\u2019s proven his ability to implement solid merchandising programs and improve inventory management.  Most recently, as you recall, he was co-president of Michaels, Inc. Greg?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Thank you, Jim.  Good afternoon, everyone.  I\u2019m very pleased to be part of the Tractor Supply team.  The company has done an outstanding job developing a strong culture driven by a focus on serving our unique customer.  I have been thrilled to see firsthand in our stores how seamlessly Tractor Supply\u2019s mission [inaudible] carried out throughout the entire organization every day and from the [storsis port] center back to our stores what is most evident to our customer.  As the company has grown into a major national chain, it has truly preserved a local hometown feel and look.  That being said, being part of TSC is an exciting opportunity for me and as we continue to be committed to being the leader in this niche market, I think that in order for us to meet the customers\u2019 evolving needs, I\u2019ve identified several key areas of focus that I expect to enhance our performance as we go into the near and the long term.  ", "Specifically as you\u2019ve heard from Jim and Tony, I will be focused on several merchandising performance initiatives in the upcoming year.  Number one, we believe there\u2019s an opportunity to improve our pricing strategy by taking advantage of pricing optimization.  In the next year we\u2019ll be using a more holistic approach to establish optimal pricing throughout our product sales cycles.  We will combine analysis of price elasticity and sound business practices to establish appropriate price points that resonate better with our customers.  Going forward we expect this new price optimization strategy to benefit our same-store sales and gross margin results.  ", "We also expect better inventory management to contribute to the company\u2019s overall margin improvement and capital efficiency efforts.  We will accomplish this by refining our test strategy that will mitigate our risk on new products as we roll them out to the chain.  Further, we are using our TVS Tractor Value System methodology to improve our line review process and ensure that the appropriate inventory investment, pricing, and products that we choose are correct for the stores.  We are also placing renewed focus on our plan-o-gram process as well.  This process begins many which have anticipated merchandise changes with our buyers, negotiating with our vendor partners on unique product, and appropriate pricing.  The process concludes with seamless execution of the new products arriving at our stores and the new plan-o-gram merchandise being placed into its designated home ready for our customers to purchase.", "Next, we see significant opportunity to accelerate our direct sourcing of merchandise.  By focusing on increasing our direct sourcing, we will be able to produce the best products for our customers from both a quality and value perspective.  I am also working to increase our private label brands and better define our existing brand mix by category.  While I am still evaluating the characteristics for each of our private brands, we will continue to drive improved margins on these products through differentiation, quality, and price point.  For example, our master hand tool storage.  It\u2019s been well received by our customers and we believe that there are opportunities to further leverage master hand in several other categories. ", "So in summary, our stores are in great shape and successfully executing these initiatives to make for an even better shopping experience for our customers while driving improved financial performance.  The energy and passion for the business permeates every level of this organization along with a sincere appreciation and knowledge of the \u201cout here\u201d lifestyle.  Our business strategy is solid, our customers continue to shop our stores, and I look forward to contributing to the team and the future success of Tractor Supply.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call back to Jim.", "James F.

(Operator Instructions) Your first question is coming from Brad Thomas of Lehman Brothers.  Please go ahead, sir.", "Brad Thomas - Lehman Brothers ", "I\u2019ll just say congratulations on a solid quarter during a tough holiday season.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you, Brad. ", "Brad Thomas - Lehman Brothers ", "Just briefly on your guidance, could you maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of what you\u2019re factoring in from a macro standpoint.  Tony, I know you said you were expecting a tough retain environment, but are you expecting it to get much worse from the way it is right now?James F. Wright", "Brad, this is Jim.  Our assumptions are that at this point in time that \u201908 looks a lot like the second half of \u201907.  Beyond that we can\u2019t guess but we do believe that we can manage it to these numbers if the current state is the normal state we\u2019ve got going forward. ", "Brad Thomas - Lehman Brothers ", "Okay, and then if we do see a more significant slow down in the sales trends, could you maybe talk about where there might be some opportunities to control costs?  I know this year you did a good job of controlling the CapEx for example.", "James F. Wright", "Brad, I won\u2019t go into details, but we have already built our contingency plans.  We\u2019ve talked to the management committee which is the top 12 executives in the company.  They understand their obligations and responsibilities and opportunities if sales fail to materialize.", "Brad Thomas - Lehman Brothers ", "Okay and then maybe just one last question.  Last quarter, Jim, I know you mentioned that you were looking for your POS to enable some freed up time from the back room to allow for some more customer service.  Do you know if that had much of a benefit on sales?", "Stanley L. Ruta", "Stan Ruta here. Yes, we\u2019ve picked up time in our back room because of the new back room functions we\u2019ve ruled out. It\u2019s allowing us to reallocate that labor to the sales floor to help us improve perpetual inventory accuracy and better service our customers.", "Brad Thomas - Lehman Brothers ", "Was there a meaningful increase in the level of customer service during the quarter?", "James F. Wright", "Brad, this is Jim.  It\u2019s really hard to assess.  There\u2019s a couple of ways to look at it.  One, when we report traffic, we\u2019re reporting transactions, so we don\u2019t measure rings and swings, so due to the fact that we had a transaction increase along with a ticket increase, we could certainly assume that our customers are being served at a higher level.  A year from now we\u2019ll have better data because we are now just launching a true customer satisfaction index initiative where we\u2019ll be getting feedback from every store every quarter and be able to statistically evaluate the level of service we\u2019re providing directly from the voice of our customers.", "Brad Thomas - Lehman Brothers ", "Okay, great.  Thanks so much. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from David Cumberland of Robert Baird.  Please go ahead, sir.", "David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. ", "Thank you.  Can you please comment on your expectations for the lawn equipment category in 2008?", "James F. Wright", "The OP industry is saying it\u2019s down 6% in units this year on top of a down \u201907, down \u201908.  We believe that we can be flat in dollars so we\u2019re anticipating probably down in units but probably flat in dollars and that is based upon a couple of initiatives.  One, we were very successful with a premium brand that\u2019s exclusive as a chain to Tractor Supply called Bad Boy back this year.  We\u2019ll be rolling out chain wide. It was in less than 40% of our stores last year.  It\u2019s a high dollar unit and uniquely positioned I think for our customers, a lot of grass to cut. We\u2019re also launching a national brand called White Outdoor Power Equipment that will replace the high end of Husky.  There\u2019s some feature benefits to our consumers with White Outdoor.  We\u2019ve also, we are watching a very high end unique exclusive to Tractor Supply and Cub Cadet dealers front mounted zero turn unit that\u2019s at the high end of our price point and I think also with that with regard to flat on dollars and maybe the increase in profitability is that we\u2019ve been very, very rigorous on both our exit and our entry inventory positions in this category, planning for this category for \u201908.", "David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. ", "On the left side of the store are you no longer planning to reset the left side in 100 more stores in Q3?", "James F. Wright", "That\u2019s correct, yes.  The test that we did on left end side, as I mentioned we had some winners, we had some question marks that we need more time, and we had some disappointments so what we\u2019ll be doing is in the 41 stores we\u2019re placing the disappointments with other additional tests to the chain we will take the best skews, the winners, but we\u2019ll be able to do that without going through the cost, the labor cost and the capital cost, of the extensive reset that you saw last year either at our store or at the manager\u2019s meeting.", "David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. ", "My last question on the e-commerce business.  At the start of \u201907 you talked about ", "$0.03 per share of incremental spending with minimal offsetting benefit.

Last year it met our expectations and we were very consistent with the guidance that we provided.  We expect obviously this year to start to ramp the sales.  We do expect that it will generate a loss and the impact will be very similar in a similar range to last year\u2019s so as a percentage it will be less impactful but from a cents per share basis it should be in about the same range.

Your next question is coming from Mitch Kaiser of Piper Jaffray.  Please go ahead, sir.  ", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray ", "Afternoon.  I was hoping you could comment to your expectations for the southeast.  I know the drought impacted you pretty significantly down there last year.  What are you forecasting for that particular region especially given the water restrictions that I think continue in that area?", "James F. Wright", "We see some moderation, frankly Kentucky, Tennessee, North Georgia.  The latest forecast we got shows some moderation, some drought relief.  Florida, actually South Florida\u2019s going to get worse is the current expectation.  I guess overall I would say slightly favorable this year over last year in outdoor power equipment in the southeast.", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay. So South Florida you think is economic, it\u2019s not weather related.  ", "James F. Wright", "It is certainly economic but in addition tot hat there is going to be forecast right now the lower two-thirds of Florida will be more droughty in \u201908 than in \u201907. ", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay and then Tony, you mentioned margin pressure in the first quarter.  Is that gross margin pressure or do you think that\u2019s SG&A pressure particularly as you go against your most difficult comp of the year.  Could you clarify that a little bit in more detail?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Yes.  I was talking more specifically about gross margin, product margin and it generally comes from a couple pieces.  One, last year the merchandise that we were selling through particularly in March when the weather was more spring-like.  We had better seasonal toward margin and less pressure there whereas we forecast March to be a little bit colder.  Then we\u2019re also taking some action on slow-moving inventory as we\u2019re moving into this quarter and we also had very similar sell through of toys and gifts in the fourth quarter so it was comparable to last year but as we moved into this quarter we are much more aggressive than marking that down and clearing it through, so those are some of the items that we see causing some margin pressure in the first quarter.", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay, I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m exactly following.  I thought you had about 60 basis points of gross margin erosion last year and I thought you took some pretty aggressive markdowns in the first quarter last year.", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Again one of the keys is cycling March and by having seasonally fresh goods in March last year with the spring-like weather we don\u2019t expect to have that opportunity.", "", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay.  But inventories are pretty clean going into the end of the quarter, though, only up 7% on I think a year-over-year basis, right?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Going into the quarter we were generally very pleased with our inventory position.", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay and then on the fourth quarter you said some clearance items.  Would you be willing to characterize what that was when the gross margin hit to blow out some inventory?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "We generally don\u2019t get that granular.", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay, thanks guys. Good luck. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Magee of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  Please go ahead, sir.", "Analyst for David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ", "Hello, this is Chris Rapple on the call for David today.  I had a question about some of the gift items that you featured in the holiday and how you felt they performed relative to expectations and what that may lead you to do next holiday.", "James F. Wright", "Good question.  On the overall with gifts we were pleased.  We had very good sell through.  The only surprise we had was that with all the news on lead paint, we saw some consumer slow down with regard to the metal die cast toys.  Not a significant issue for us but there was some shift away from normally what is a pretty good demand item for us in metal toys.  Beyond that we had some learning, every year when you go into gift you test the new things and price points.  Some of those worked, some of those did not, but on balance we actually had a very good gift season.", "Analyst for David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jack Murphy from William Blair.  Please go ahead.  ", "Jack Murphy - William Blair ", "Good afternoon.  A couple of questions.  First, Tony could you talk a little bit more about the incremental or potential incremental $20 million in CapEx?  I think you said something about new site acquisition opportunities, something like that.  Could you just flesh that out a little bit?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Over the past couple quarters we talked a little bit about acquiring sites and we\u2019ve looked at basically the cap rate versus the developers reselling of the sites and we felt that economically it would make more sense for us to work up front with the developers doing some self development and/or acquiring some of those sites. So we\u2019ve set up a contingency in our CapEx projection that we would utilize to do some site acquisitions or assistance with the developers in developing those sites.", "Jack Murphy - William Blair ", "Okay, I just want to make sure that was the same issue that you talked about and then also I\u2019m going to circle back to the comment I think Jim you made that the environment, you anticipate the environment being one in which you could pass on pricing or it be a difficult environment for consumers to accept pricing.  Is there any particular areas that you\u2019re seeing concerns there that kind of prompt that comment?  If you could just give us a sense on that.  ", "James F. Wright - deep voice", "Actually where we\u2019re seeing the inflationary categories, those categories that are a significant portion of cost of goods is petroleum based or corn or soy based, actually we\u2019ve seen the industry move and the consumer accept and we\u2019ve seen unit movement continue to run.  Our comment was more broad based, recognizing that the consumer is in some cases staying home a little bit more, certainly being more conservative of their dollars.  It\u2019s more of a broad feeling that we have that this is not the time that we\u2019ll be able to gain a tremendous amount of traction through a price increases.  That said, however, we do believe that we have opportunity to strategically raise prices due to the fact that we have a number of price zones where we have perhaps the more competitive than we need to be.  We are also a few months now into a more rigorous price elasticity study and we\u2019re going to move from an opinion based pricing strategy where we believe an item or category is highly visible to our consumers to a scenario where we begin testing a zone or two with marginally higher prices and we measure elasticity against a control group.  ", "Jack Murphy - William Blair ", "Okay great, and then just one last question.  Given this context, are the guidance parameters that you\u2019ve given here, could you just give us a level of comp, obviously it\u2019s outside of the guidance, at which you think that you\u2019d be able to get leverage for full year 2008?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "We\u2019ve stated in the past that we really need a 4% to 4.5% comp to leverage while we\u2019re in the 13% store growth mode. ", "Jack Murphy - William Blair ", "So even with the occupancy drag, you still feel that would be the case?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Yes, specifically for 2008.  Now that might lessen as we move into 2009 but generally that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.  As we stated in the call, there\u2019s obviously a non-cash drag when it comes to the stock option plan as well, so really those are the two key ingredients for SG&A to leveraging.  ", "Jack Murphy - William Blair ", "Thanks.", "", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from Peter Benedict of Wachovia.  Please go ahead. ", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets ", "Hey guys, thanks.  I just wanted to get a better understanding our your approach on the share buy back.  It sounds like from the guidance you\u2019re not really assuming much but you were pretty aggressive in the last quarter at prices that were a lot higher than where we\u2019re at right now in terms of the stock.  Is it in unwillingness to dip into the revolver on the credit line in this environment or are you just trying to be conservative on the outlook and have buyback be upside to the numbers?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Peter, this is Tony.  What we\u2019re saying is that in our guidance we have no projection for or no forecasting for the share buy back.  So we anticipate that we will buy back shares, however, it is not included in the forecasted numbers.

It sounds like you got some initial traction on that.

Wright ", "", "We will, as the year unfolds we will begin rolling out and testing different categories and different zones, watching the elasticity and then rolling forward where it makes sense for us to optimize. ", "We have another initiative that we are going to be pursuing. If you look at our pricing today, we have a lot of odd penny pricing and we have the opportunity to move that up to logical retail price points and there is some opportunity for margin expansion there provided that we do not have a unit decline in that product and that is frankly yet to be determined.", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets", "", "Tony just one more thing on the first quarter. It sounds like gross margin is expected to be down year over year, certainly with the tough sales comparison you probably have comps down as well. You did say, I just want to make sure, that you thought you\u2019d get a normal get ready quarter earnings environment, earnings per share? I mean historically you guys have done kind of flat to maybe plus $0.05 or so in the first quarter if you exclude last year. Is that the type of range we should be thinking about?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "", "When we talk about get ready, we expect very limited earnings in the first quarter.

", "Brian Nagel - UBS", "", "First off, with respect to the competitive environment, the holiday was much more challenging for many of the retailers. You guys performed well. With that as a backdrop, have you seen any more aggressive price promotions or just promotional activity out of some of the retailers you compete with in the various categories?", "James F. Wright ", "", "Nothing that has impacted us. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of off-price activity; well, not tremendous. There is more off-price activity going on, more couponing and so forth, but in product categories that are most important to us in the fourth quarter, that noise had very little impact on our business. We were really not compelled to match anyone\u2019s promotional effort. ", "The one thing that is kind of structurally in our industry today on big ticket is the 12-month no interest, no pay, and that obviously comes with a cost. We did have a little more activity there to match our competitors on some big ticket products in Q4. ", "But having said that, a couple points. One, we are fortunate in that we have a core business that is somewhat non-discretionary and businesses in which we are truly the destination store. Those businesses performed very, very well without increased promotional activity in Q4 and we anticipate that they will continue to grow and continue to perform well as we go forward. ", "The next thing is that with the frequency of our core customers visiting our stores, it would have to be a significant offer to disrupt the shopping patterns. Finally, I think it\u2019s an error for us and others may think differently, to get on to the heavy promotional during this tough time in retail because at some point in time as we come through this slow period, they\u2019re going to have to get back off that or stick with a high-low strategy which I think is counter to what today\u2019s consumer wants to shop. They want to shop at their time and their convenience and know they\u2019re getting a value, not wait for a promotional event.", "Brian Nagel - UBS", "", "Greg, you mentioned in your prepared remarks you talked about the direct sourcing. Remind us where we are as far as what share of your sales and your products now are direct source? ", "I was just over in China looking at some of these sourcing operations, what impact if any would the higher costs we\u2019re seeing out of some of these emerging markets, could that have upon your direct sourcing efforts?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "", "Let\u2019s first, Brian, break it down. We\u2019re about 7% direct source from China to TSC. That number we plan to grow. I think you have heard us talk about before, we\u2019d like to grow that number to the 13% to 15% range over time. ", "The pricing compression that is occurring right now with China, it\u2019s kind of twofold really. One is raw material costs are definitely going up. Steel-type products, we have seen some pricing issues there, but we have addressed those at the retail side here. The consumer I think expects that some of that product is going to cost more as they enter our store. We are just really beginning to look at how we can direct source more product, and we\u2019re kind of throwing a little broader net than maybe we did in the past. ", "There is more for me probably to discuss here than we have time today, but I can assure you that we\u2019re looking to do more on a direct basis. We have already put together some plans and will finalize those with our EC and the board in the next probably six to eight weeks about how we will progress forward. ", "But at this point in time, except for a few minor categories, it\u2019s pretty much what we expected, and we\u2019ve been passing the cost increases at the retail level, so we haven\u2019t seen any real pull back by the consumer yet.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Matt Nemer - Thomas Wiesel Partners. ", "Matt Nemer - Thomas Wiesel Partners", "", "My question is regarding traffic trends, which were quite a bit stronger than what we have seen from other retailers. Is there any one thing that may be driving that? Are there any changes in the advertising mix or the amount of advertising during the fourth quarter, or if it\u2019s just more a function of the easier comp from last year?", "James F. Wright ", "", "Actually our advertising spend as a percent of sales was level or slightly down in Q4 year over year. The ads really weren\u2019t a whole lot hotter than they were last year. What\u2019s interesting when you look at our business is that our traffic was a result of the amount of business we did in consumables. In pet and animal consumables we continue to grow those businesses as we have for the last four or five years at a rate well above the overall chain growth. Once one of our consumers begins to feed their pet animal on our feed, there is a natural every two weeks, every three weeks, once a month repurchase cycle and we saw those categories perform really quite well as I mentioned I think in the press release and the comments.", "Matt Nemer - Thomas Wiesel Partners", "", "Is that a mix shift to smaller bags that\u2019s driving shorter cycle times, or is it share that is maybe coming from another part of the market?", "James F. Wright ", "", "I think it\u2019s share gain. We have actually looked at bag size and average ticket size within those categories and we do not see our consumers trading down to lower price product to any great degree, and they\u2019re not trading down to bag size.", "Matt Nemer - Thomas Wiesel Partners", "", "Tony mentioned that the \u201807 store class outperformed the prior two years, and I\u2019m wondering on what basis and can you provide any granularity on the performance relative to the profits of those stores after occupancy expense?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "", "Generally, Matt, we wouldn\u2019t disclose in detail. I would tell you that on a sales level, the \u201807 stores performed similarly to the \u201806 stores, but just on an operating profit basis. The profit that they generated far exceeded that of the 2006 and the 2005 stores. It\u2019s just an observation and a lot of times we receive questions on the performance of the new stores, but we\u2019re very pleased with the stores that we have brought on board really over the last three years and we expect as we move out of this difficult retail environment that these stores really will be very profitable going forward.", "Matt Nemer - Thomas Wiesel Partners", "", "You\u2019re ramping your new store growth for Dell\u2019s. Can you give us a sense of what you\u2019re planning to do there, what sort of locations or markets or new markets will you be putting, will you be placing Dell\u2019s stores in?", "James F. Wright ", "", "The chain as we bought it was located pretty much up and down I-5 in Western Washington, and most of the new growth is going to be Eastern Washington, Oregon. The reason we\u2019re doing that is we\u2019re viewing \u201808 for Dell\u2019s as another year of learning where we will continue to refine the how we go to market with regard to advertising, how we assort the stores, and the principal learning that needs to occur is to find out how well these stores perform, how fast they ramp to profitability, how fast they take market share in areas where the Dell\u2019s name is not known and in areas where locally grown hay is not available or is available. ", "In the Pacific Northwest and coastal Northwest, all of the hay is imported in for horse owners, and the hay is a significant part of Dell\u2019s business. Recognizing that that\u2019s a unique market for us to determine the multi-state viability of Dell\u2019s, we\u2019ve got to take the plunge and get outside of that environment. So our growth will be principally in those types of markets in \u201808.", "Matt Nemer - Thomas Wiesel Partners", "", "You mentioned that some IT projects were pushed out from \u201807 to \u201808. Is that the environment or is it specific to vendors or products or something else?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "", "It\u2019s a combination of cost and just prioritization. Currently we\u2019ve reprioritized bringing Dell\u2019s onto our systems, and reprioritized that and moved a few others. Some involved security because obviously there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about security and we\u2019re taking a much greater focus on security, and so we will grapple with those as we move into 2008, but a lot of it really was based on reprioritization.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Lawrence - Morgan Keegan. ", "John Lawrence - Morgan Keegan", "", "Jim, could you comment quickly fourth quarter on the performance now that you have had C.E. Schmidt for three seasons or so? The difference between that and the name brand, what did you see in the performance of that private label?", "James F. Wright ", "", "We had a relatively good year in heavyweight outerwear. Both categories, both the Carhartt branded and the C.E. Schmidt performed really quite well for us in November and December. ", "October, as Tony mentioned, was abnormally warm so we kind of missed that first burst at the fullest possible margin but overall, we\u2019re pleased with it. C.E. Schmidt continues to gain share marginally, but we continue to be really very pleased with our Carhartt business. ", "This was the first full fall season with the C.E. Schmidt line leather footwear, and frankly we were delighted with the result of that. It is a high quality boot. It\u2019s priced at the low end, work boots are priced from 60 to $120, and we brought C.E. Schmidt in at around high 60s and a tremendous value proposition. We direct imported it, and we are frankly delighted with that, John.", "John Lawrence - Morgan Keegan", "", "Just a couple merchandising questions, if you will. Going back to the outdoor power equipment, if you talk about the initiatives, another private label, at the end of the day will the SKU mix go to a lower price point or you\u2019re moving the price points up with just better margin?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "", "You answered your own question, John. We\u2019re moving the price points up with better margin. That\u2019s the strategy.", "John Lawrence - Morgan Keegan", "", "So the point that you\u2019re vacating is that competitive low end?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "", "I wouldn\u2019t say vacate. What I would say is not trying to grow that piece of the business.", "John Lawrence - Morgan Keegan", "", "Lastly, could we talk just one more a little bit about the 41 store test? A lot of that product was expanded lines without the return for that test is just not to reset but just get the benefit from those incremental wins?", "James F. Wright ", "", "At this point, John, that is correct. As you recall, John, a few years ago we significantly expanded our pet department, changed the fixture height, created a boutique. We also did not go forward with that program, that complete reset, but we did go forward with a couple other SKUs that proved out to be very solid winners for us.", "John Lawrence - Morgan Keegan", "", "Right, so we\u2019ll just see a continuation of that on that side of the store?", "James F. Wright ", "", "That\u2019s correct. For now. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019ll never reset that side of the store, but what we have seen is the major benefit is really in the product and additionally we have not been a great retail company with regard to use of end caps on that side of the store and we believe that we can make some wonderful product presentations through better use and better merchandising of our end caps throughout both right and left hand sides of the store.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Dan Wewer - Raymond James. ", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "", "To make sure I understand the components of the \u201808 guidance, and looking at the midpoint would imply EPS growth of around 7%. That assumes same-store sales at a midpoint of 2% which is not bad. It sounds like gross margin rate will increase, which is good. Further, the leverage from occupancy will be about half in \u201808 of what it was in \u201907.", "In trying to think about what is left that\u2019s weighing against the earnings growth, is it just primarily the incentive compensation either through options and the cash compensation, is that the right way to think about the \u201808 model?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "", "I would agree with that. Those were the two components that were left, was the incentive piece and if you tie that together with the options those together is the difference that you\u2019re looking at. ", "We had mentioned that we have slight deleveraging from our store personnel side when it comes to adding the new stores as well, but it\u2019s not as significant as the impact on the occupancy.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "", "Tony, earlier you were estimating that 4% same store sales growth is needed to maintain a flat expense rate. Do you think it\u2019s actually higher than that in 2008 given that 1% to 3% forecast results in significant deleverage so that extra percentage point of same store sales growth looks like it may not be enough to achieve a flat expense rate?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "", "Yeah, I definitely would lean to the higher side. The 4.5% is closer to that and depending on the environment 5% might be reasonable. Our general guidance has been the 4% to 4.5% range, and that can be achievable. Relative to 2008, I think you\u2019re probably close there. I think you\u2019ll see the stock option expense start to moderate in 2009 as some of the prior years start to roll off.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "", "Greg, you had outlined a number of initiatives. When you think about these, which ones do you think would pay off the soonest and when that may occur and which ones will take longer to achieve?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "", "Well, the number one focus for me is really the management of our inventory and we are really spending a lot of time right now with much more rigor around that entire piece of the company. ", "Number two I would say that probably the price optimization component just from the standpoint of early wins and things that we\u2019ve recognized and identified. ", "Those are probably the two things I would tell you, and then the direct sourcing piece takes time. We want to make sure that we move ahead two or three steps and not drop back two or three steps as we do this, so it\u2019s more of getting the platform right first before we really start to move fast there, but that\u2019s how I would align the three.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "", "The inventory management, we already saw the benefits of that in the fourth quarter, so we\u2019re already there, right?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "", "Well, I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re already there. I would say we\u2019re just beginning.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "", "That\u2019s going to be achieved, it sounds like by taking clearance markdowns maybe a little bit sooner during the season?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "", "Well, that\u2019s one aspect of it, but I will tell you that there is a very rigorous look now on a month-to-month basis with some forward looking into our open to buys and where the business is headed and so on and so forth, so I would tell you that it\u2019s my number one focus, making that inventory much more productive, really evaluating where we\u2019re spending our dollars and where we are getting a return on those dollars. We\u2019re just beginning.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "", "Finally just on pricing optimization, fourth quarter of \u201808, is it possible you can begin to see some benefits by then, or should we be thinking about optimization being an \u201809 payback?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "", "Well we\u2019ll see some in 2008 toward the latter part of third and forth quarter, yes.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jeff Wimmer \u2013 JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Wimmer \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "You spoke about some of the changes in outdoor power equipment specifically on the high end, but I was wondering if you were changing your mix or SKUs towards the lower price point or making any adjustments in your lower-end offerings?", "James F. Wright ", "", "No, significantly not. The overall strategy is to grow the dollars and grow the profit, have profitable sales, maintain revenue on a flat comp, and put our emphasis at the larger units, the more branded units, and the units that are most applicable to our consumers who measure their yards in acres, not in front feet.", "Jeff Wimmer \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Last quarter you mentioned that if you had good weather you would probably see 150 to 170 bips benefit to this quarter\u2019s comp. Looks like you probably got all of that and then some, so I was wondering if weather was neutral what your comp would have been? Do you have any sense?", "James F. Wright ", "", "You\u2019re talking about Q4?", "Jeff Wimmer \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Yes.", "James F. Wright ", "", "My assessment of the quarter was that the weather was neutral. Weather was negative in October, better in November and December, but on the overall, I would say it turned to neutral after being negative last year.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Vivian Ma - Oppenheimer. ", "Vivian Ma - Oppenheimer", "", "First on the occupancy, I just want to get a bit more clarification. For the average rental rates for 2007, could you provide some more color on whether it was more or less stable or did it go up?  What is the outlook for 2008? I\u2019ve got one more question after that.", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "", "Yes, on the new stores the rate did increase, but what we do in how we report generally is we look at it more as a percent of sales, so we\u2019re not seeing a significant escalation per se. They were above the 2006 level, but more importantly we look at them as a percent of sale and we\u2019re trying to leverage that down. So we\u2019ll see that going down in 2008 as we discussed and it will be at a much lower level as we move into 2009.", "Vivian Ma - Oppenheimer", "", "For \u201808 on the per square foot basis, do you think it\u2019s up or down directionally?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "", "It would definitely move down for 2008.", "Vivian Ma - Oppenheimer", "", "My next question is regarding your initiatives on the private brands and the direct sourcing, are there any new product categories that you would be making a bigger push in \u201808?", "James F. Wright ", "", "We did talk about the White Outdoor power brand being introduced. We did mention about Bad Boy and that\u2019s just an expansion from a test a year ago. This is all in the OPE side of the business, but I think I would be reluctant to comment on any other things that we may be planning at this time.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest. ", "Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest", "", "First on the gross margins, still not understanding why we didn\u2019t see better gross margins this quarter with higher traffic, higher ticket, and higher foreign sourced inventories. Could you expand on that a little bit?", "James F. Wright ", "", "I\u2019ll go first, Jay. Some of that was mix. When we looked at the products we sold, again I mentioned we did very well with pet and animal feed and food. Those are below average margin categories. The categories where we had the biggest headwinds, I think we also mentioned this either in our notes in the release were on the tool and hardware sides. Those categories are very margin rich and they did not perform as well as our core animal-related business. So it really was mix more than anything else that drove our margins.", "Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest", "", "On the inventory side, glad to see that you are focusing again on maximizing the dollars from your inventory. Are there any targets you\u2019d be willing to give on working capital improvements or do you still have the long-term turn target of I believe it was 3.3 to 3.4?", "James F. Wright ", "", "I have been stating that we have the ability to improve our turnover of 15 basis points a year and since I first started quoting that, I think we have gone backward 30. I remain resolute in our ability to improve our turnover about probably 10 next year or so and then 15 accelerating forward.  I do believe possibly offset by direct import that we do have the opportunity to get north of 3 and approach 3.3 over term and at term it\u2019s probably five years.", "Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest", "", "My last question is looking at gross margins for next year, commodity costs for grains, wheat, soy beans, corn, et cetera near I think 20 and 30 year highs, how much of an impact should we expect from these higher prices as we move into \u201808?", "James F. Wright ", "", "Thus far we have been able to pass those cost increases along to our consumer and most critically to this point, we have not seen our consumers trading down to lower priced products which in those commodities also carry a lower margin. So a kind of wild card, I\u2019m pretty confident that we\u2019ll be able to continue pricing at retail to reflect cost. The industry seems to be in sync with that. What I don\u2019t fully understand is what the consumer behavior might be if that bag of feed that has already gone from $10 to $12, goes from $12 to $14.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Wayne Hood - BMO Capital. ", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital", "", "Greg as you\u2019ve gotten to look at things as you have come in, do you think you\u2019re going to have to rethink the company\u2019s distribution network given the import strategy that you want to pursue? Just in not having enough facilities now to do a big import program in an cost efficient way.  ", "If you have to do that in a year from now or two years from now, Tony, does that mean there\u2019s going to be a ramp up in capital spending or expenses associated with that that would come on at a time when the occupancy costs might start to moderate? ", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "", "Let me take the first piece. We will do this very logically and very pragmatic as far as how we plan to grow the direct side. Today we have capacity in our DCs actually to handle some of these products. There is no short-term issue but I will tell you, once you put this into play and we start to look at the opportunities, there\u2019s always a likelihood that we may need a facility on the West Coast. As we\u2019re expanding our store base toward that direction, we\u2019re hoping that the lines will cross at that point. ", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "", "Relative to our growth, we had always earmarked that we would have some funds available, most likely in 2009 and now as it stands more stretched out in 2010 for a West Coast distribution center. Having capital in the budget next year to expand our Waco facility, I think you\u2019d see the year-over-year capital infusion not be significant. Again it generally is part of our long-term plan, so if Greg were to come in and take a harder look and say that we needed to adjust our distribution network, we have the capital allocated in our long-term plan.", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital", "", "I wanted to come back to several questions that have come up, and that is the leverage in the model that when you look at the third quarter, you had a 3.8% comp or almost close to the 4% to 5% that you\u2019re talking about to leverage expenses, so I was wondering if you could break out or tell us what the delta was when you strip out the new stores?", "In other words, if you look at the delta in the comparable store operating margin, was that flat, up, down, 70? I mean how can we think about that in trying to measure what the leverage is in the model on those existing stores stripping out the new ones?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "", "We would not go into that type of detail. We do take a look at it, and we understand the components, and what is a challenge in answering the question of what does it take to leverage at a particular comp level is when you take that growth component out and the other pieces that are associated with it such as your pre-opening expense, your real estate teams, that\u2019s where it becomes a question mark as to what are those allocated resources. So as much as we analyze it and we understand the components, I would not be willing to share the details because there\u2019s just too many pieces.", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital", "", "Would it be fair though, Tony, to think that the operating margin probably was down in comparable stores \u2013 in the comparable stores on a 3.8 comp?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "", "Not necessarily. I would not necessarily assume that.", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital", "", "Can you give us the absolute share count; not the weighted share count given the buyback at the end of the quarter, but what the absolute shares were?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "", "We\u2019ll have, let me have Randy get back to you on that one.", "James F. Wright ", "", "Thank you. We have time for one more question. We have already set a record for the call, but we\u2019ll take one more question.", "Operator", "", "Your final question comes from Andrew Wolf - BB&T. ", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T", "", "I think Dan went over this, but I thought it was very important. The pricing optimization -- and I think Greg you mentioned your number one goal is going to be to increase the productivity of inventory -- starting there, when I think of that, my mind goes to a measured [jimroy]. Jim you kind of alluded to it, you want to get inventory turns up. As financial analysts, Greg or Jim, should we be looking at a [jimroy] number, and if we should, do you have a goal there too? Is that how from a financial accounting point of view we should be seeing how well you\u2019re doing with inventory productivity?", "James F. Wright ", "", "That is a retail metric, and I\u2019m not sure we can boil it down to a stated objective and aren\u2019t likely to share that publicly, but certainly we look at [jimroy] on each of our 364 categories and have that calculated on a monthly basis. The key drivers are higher margins and lower inventories and it all works, and we recognize that we have a tremendous opportunity.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T", "", "Sometimes you hear the productivity of inventory and it\u2019s a more basic thing. There\u2019s a lot of dead inventory or you need to do a SKU rationalization. I mean, is there anything like that that you\u2019re referring to?", "James F. Wright ", "", "No, there\u2019s very little dead inventory. There is certainly the opportunity in some categories to rationalize SKUs, and we have some opportunities to rationalize SKUs across our various store volume groups and across different geography. Historically we have not been nearly as regionally specific in our plan-o-graming and inventory modeling nor have we been as volume specific as we have the opportunity to be with the systems we currently have in place.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T", "", "On the pricing side, Greg, I think you said it was more about elasticity and internal measures, but is this also about zone pricing and again geographic pricing? What is it replacing currently? Do you guys have a system or is it more of an ad hoc process at this point?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "", "It\u2019s a combination and I will tell you that it\u2019s really a refinement of what we currently have, but it is probably refining it one or two more, peeling back the onion even further. We don\u2019t believe that with the mix of business that we have that we need all the pricing zones that we may currently be supporting.", "Secondly as far as how we\u2019re going about this, there\u2019s some as we said holistic things that we can do. There are some systemic things that we\u2019re looking at. So it\u2019s a combination of both and we\u2019ll test it first before we absolutely take the role, and my partner Stan and I have to work through this to make sure that it makes sense. If we see any unit slow down or drop at all, of course that\u2019s a flag for us, but we believe it\u2019s a very logical approach, and we\u2019re very excited about it.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T", "", "Tony if you have the rent expense handy or an approximation of it, that might be useful.", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "", "Again, we don\u2019t disclose that. We just talk to SG&A in total and give general guidance as to some of the components, what are the moving parts, but we don\u2019t give specifics relative to rent.", "James F. Wright", "In conclusion, I\u2019m very pleased with our ability to navigate through the challenges of \u201807. Since the current macroenvironment may parallel the second half of \u201807, we are tempering our expectations appropriately. However we\u2019re not going to let external factors prevent us from continuing to reach our long term strategic growth objectives. ", "The lifestyle we serve will continue to grow. Our role as the authority for that lifestyle will continue to strengthen, our customers are resistant and resilient and our team is very committed. In short, we are and have been and remain a growth company. ", "I\u2019d like to thank all our shareholders, our team members, and our customers for their continued support of our business, and we look forward to another exciting year of growth and profitability here at Tractor Supply and look forward to speaking to all of you at the next call.

", "The information contained in the call is accurate only as of the date discussed. Investors should not assume that these statements will remain operative at a later time. Lastly, Tractor Supply Company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed in this call. Now I\u2019m pleased to introduce Jim Wright, Chairman, President and CEO. ", "James Wright", "I\u2019m here today with Tony Crudele, our CFO; Stan Ruta, EVP of Store Operations; and Greg Sandfort, EVP of Merchandising. We always refer to our first quarter as our get-ready quarter as we prepare for the important spring selling season. This year we are cycling very favorable weather, as well as record sales and profits from last year\u2019s first quarter. ", "As we enter 2008, we expected buying patterns for this year to be similar to the second half of 2007, however, throughout the first quarter, consumers became even more cautious with their spending than we anticipated. This appears to have affected overall sales and traffic as well as initial sales of big-ticket items. ", "Additionally, we believe the warm weather in February and the cold weather in March also impacted first quarter performance of our seasonal merchandise. With that said, during the quarter, we made progress on our key initiatives for 2008 to grow and improve the business. Let me briefly discuss a few of those highlights. First, we did grow total sales by 2.9% and improved gross margin by 70 basis points to 30.7% despite the challenge in external environment and comping against record performance in Q707. ", "Secondly, we are pleased with the solid progress we made on our inventory management initiatives. We were deliverant with our liner review process and took a disciplined approach to improving the productivity of our inventory. To protect gross margins, we implemented a controlled mark-down cadence that allowed us to clear through remaining holiday cold weather and gift inventory much better than last year. We also experienced early benefits from our price optimization strategy. ", "Finally, we continue to generate solid growth in our core consumable categories, including animal health and pet. Core lifestyle products have been a driver of growth and repeat business over the past few years. We believe that our position as a market leader in these categories will remain a key strength for our business in this more challenging environment as our consumers rely on Tractor Supply Company for their everyday, non-discretionary lifestyle needs. ", "In conclusion during the quarter, we were able to make key improvements in the business and our enhanced merchandising management initiatives are already beginning to gain traction; however, we do recognize that there\u2019s a shift in how consumers are behaving, given the economic pressures that are affecting them. ", "That said, we\u2019ve adjusted some of our plans and are diligently managing all current costs and initiatives to address the consumer environment while continuing to position Tractor Supply for long-term as a growth company. In doing so, we\u2019re intensifying our efforts in key areas and beginning to make progress late in the first quarter. I\u2019ll discuss our plans for remainder of 2008 later in the call, but first I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tony to review our financial performance during the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. ", "Anthony Crudele ", "While sales did not meet our expectations, we are pleased with several aspects of our performance, which included solid gross management and inventory management and SG&A control. For the first quarter ended March 29, 2008, sales increased 2.9% to $576.2 million compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. The total comp sales for the period decreased 6.5% and non-comp sales were approximately $53.4 million or 9.3% of sales. Please note that we had one less selling day in the quarter due to the Easter shift. The one less day negatively impacted Q1 comp by approximately 170 basis points. ", "Dell stores comp sales, although negative, performed better than company average. While the core consumable business continued to thrive, sales from discretionary and big-ticket items were lower due to weak consumer spending, coupled by a late spring. Such categories include short-line equipment, compressors, trailers, generators, and riders. ", "Although comp transaction count was down 3.8%, this compares to a strong comp transaction increased 7.1% last year. So for the two-year period, we had a net positive 3.3% increase in comp transactions. This was the first decline in comp transaction count in nearly two years. Average ticket was down 2.9% and represented less than half the comp sales decline. ", "Looking at sales patterns throughout the quarter, sales were strongest in January and comp sales were positive, very favorable selling conditions in the prior year and extremely cold February and early spring in March. Excluding the one less comp day in March 2008, as a result of the Easter shift, both months had negative comps and performed similarly. ", "With respect to regional sales trends, comp sales were negative in all regions of the company. As expected, the Southwest was the least impacted by the year-over-year weather comparisons. The weakest performance occurred in the north and northern Midwest states, which were most subject to the weather variabilities. ", "Turning to gross margin, we achieved an approximate 70 basis point improvement. Slightly less than half of the improvement resulted from the better product mix as a result of fewer rider sales and other big-ticket items, which had below company average margins. Additionally, we benefited from strong management in the quarter and our price optimization initiatives that are beginning to take hold. ", "On a year-over-year basis for the quarter, import purchases were flat and slightly under 6% of comp purchases for the quarter. The lack of increase and import volume in the quarter resulted from better management of the flow of seasonable merchandise in our effort to improve turns as well as the continued strength of our core consumable business, which for the most part is domestically sourced. ", "Our improved gross margins, partially offset by an increase in freight expense, which increased by 25 basis points compared to the prior year quarter and was related to fuel increases and the mix of goods that had higher than chain average freight cost.", "SG&A including depreciation as a percent of sales was 30.8%, an increase of approximately 240 basis point from the same quarter in the prior year. Obviously, the negative comp store sales impacted our ability to leverage expenses in the quarter. It should be noted that we did leverage our advertising expenses, because we had one less circular in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the prior year quarter. ", "Based on our expectations for a cooler March, we held demo days in early April this year instead of March as we did in 2007. As many of you know, Demo Days is our annual spring event that encourages our customers to try our latest riders before buying them. The circular ad plan for the second quarter is comparable with the prior year. ", "We opened 27 stores and did not relocate any stores in the first quarter, compared to 22 store openings and 7 relocations in the prior year\u2019s first quarter. As a result, pre-opening expenses were approximately $2.4 million compared to $2.1 million in the prior year quarter. ", "Looking at the balance sheet, on a per-store basis at quarter end, inventory levels decreased approximately 8.2% compared to the prior year. Our calculation is based on average cost of inventory and excludes in-transit inventory and inventory held at unopened stores. In-transit inventory at the end of the quarter was consistent year-over-year at approximately $23 million. ", "We have a keen focus on inventory management and exited the winter season in great condition. We believe that several of our actions to improve inventory productivity are beginning to gain traction. Greg and his team will continue to drive this improvement. ", "Although turns decrease 10 basis points to an annualized 2.21 turn, as a result of the softer sales, we believe that we are better positioned moving into the spring selling season to drive inventory turnover improvement on a full year basis. ", "We improved our accounts payable financing of our inventory from approximately 43.5% up to 47% resulting principally from better accounts payable management and vendor dating. Again, this has been a focus for the merchandise team and we are making substantial progress.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $26.5 million, the majority of which relates to our new store opening program and includes $8.5 million for the acquisition of two store properties. Last year first quarter CapEx was $16.4 million. ", "During the first quarter, we repurchased 77,000 shares or $2.9 million dollars for a cumulative total of $153 million since the inception of our stock repurchase program in February 2007. During the first quarter, as the market became more volatile and more risk was introduced, we slowed our repurchase program. ", "At quarter end, we had approximately $47 million remaining under our current stock repurchase program. Subject to prevailing market conditions, we expect to continue to make additional purchases as part of our long-term objective of reducing our cost capital. ", "The benefits of our inventory and accounts payable financing initiatives cannot be overlooked as we have managed to complete $153 million of stock repurchases over the last 14 months and funded store growth and the related inventory by adding less than $50 million dollars of revolver debt. This also is debited in a limited increase in interest expense over last year. Although interest rates are now lower than we anticipated at the beginning of the year, we are pleased that our outstanding revolver balance has been well below our plan as we execute these various initiatives. ", "Turning to our current outlook for the full year of 2008, as we evaluate the retail environment, at this time, we believe there is much uncertainty. As discussed, we began 2008 with the expectation that the consumer spending would be similar to the second half of 2007. For the first quarter, the economy weakened further. ", "Although the first quarter can provide us some insight into the business trends, we believe it is important to view our business in half-year increments. Although April to date performance has been more consistent with our original 2008 outlook, it is too early to declare a trend for our most important quarter; therefore, at this time we believe it is more prudent to plan that the consumer will continue to be cautious. ", "Under that scenario, we revised our sales expectations to reflect first quarter results and currently anticipated sales trends. We now expect 2008 net sales to be approximately $2.98 billion to $3.04 billion from our prior guidance of $3.01 to $3.08 billion. We expect same store sales for the year to be approximately flat to 2% compared to prior expectations of an increase of approximately 1% to 3%. ", "We remain committed to improving the business while growing the chain throughout the year to offset lower comp line expectations, we are tightly managing costs and further reducing incremental expenses. Later in the call, Jim will discuss an aggressive expense management program we began implementing in the first quarter that we believe will help offset the shortfall in our current full year sales expectations. ", "We believe maintaining our expansion strategy is key to positioning the company for long-term growth while we may shift into 2009, the opening of six to eight of our 95 to 100 new stores we plan to open this year. We will continue our organic growth strategy. In addition to our comp management program, we will be prudently managing our capital expenditures. Although our capital expenditures are driven principally by our store expansion program, we have leverage in place to reduce our original 2008 guidance by 10% to between $90 to $95 million, excluding any purchases of store properties. ", "Based on Q1 results and our cautious outlook, we are trending at or slightly below the low end of our previously provided range, which was $2.54 to $2.62 per diluted share. We will continue monitoring trends closely throughout the second quarter, again, our most important selling season and profitable quarter. ", "We anticipate this will influence our outlook for the remainder of the year. We will provide a more definitive outlook at our Q2 conference call consistent with our belief that our business needs to be viewed at the half year. ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Jim and he will discuss more details on our plans for the remainder of 2008. ", "James Wright ", "Beginning this year, we laid out three key initiatives for 2008, which are the to first grow the business, improve the business, and to continue to focus on people. As many of you know, our efforts to improve the business this year are focused on refining our CRM strategy, tightly managing our real estate and occupancy costs and executing key merchandising initiatives. In light of the shifts that we\u2019ve seen thus far in consumer spending patterns, we\u2019ve placed an intense focus on our near term initiatives. ", "We believe this will help us negotiate the current consumer environment and better position our business for when we return to a more normalized consumer spending patterns. It\u2019s also been important to note that we are prepared to react quickly should demand for seasonable big-ticket goods strengthen. ", "We have revised our plans for remainder of 2008 and have taken prudent action that allows to better offset pressure on sales and rising costs. I\u2019ll now provide some additional information regarding the actions we have implemented. ", "An aggressive and proactive expense management program and focusing on reducing incremental discretionary costs, we believe this will help us offset potentially softer sales. If we achieve sales results that are aligned with our full year forecast, it will also assist us in leveraging SG&A. ", "Most importantly, we believe we can make these changes without sacrificing customer service. The actions we\u2019ve taken include managing store payroll aggressively to correspond with store sales variability, maintain the current personnel base and restricting non-strategic hires, stopping all nine critical projects and reducing non-essential capital expenditures. ", "We will continue, however, to fund critical store maintenance items. Cutting costs in areas such as marketing, store support center, transportation, distribution of technology, and business travel as well as other areas has also been implemented. Additionally, we are evaluating ways to offset the impact of inflation on commodities, cost of rising steel, corn, soy, and petroleum-based products at considerable rates. ", "Historically, we\u2019ve had success in passing these costs along to our consumers. We also believe there are certain opportunities to raise prices strategically. We are now several months into a rigorous price elasticity study that we began testing on certain products in certain zones with marginally higher prices and we are pleased at the progress we\u2019ve made thus far in this area. ", "While we must execute specific actions to protect our business during this uncertain time, we have not lost sight of the importance to focus on people. We are committed to providing knowledgeable and friendly customer service in every store every day. We\u2019ve been tracking customer service levels now for the past two quarters. We\u2019re utilizing this information as we continue to study and learn about the key drivers of customer delight and loyalty. ", "Thus far, we are pleased with our baseline stores and we plan to further strengthen our relationships with consumers during the year. We\u2019ll assure that our merchandise is compelling and relevant, our inventory levels are appropriate, our in-stock position is strong, and that our employees are providing the best possible in store experience. ", "Looking forward, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the long-term opportunities ahead for Tractor Supply. We are committed to maintaining our growth during this challenging time. We\u2019ll grow by opening stores in new and existing markets, by increasing sales of existing stores through merchandise changes, and investing in our e-commerce platform. ", "The key to our success has always been our dedication to the unique niche we serve and our ability to meet the distinct needs of those living the rural lifestyle. As a result, Tractor Supply Company is the authority in our niche. We enjoy the defendable position and we are very well positioned for long-term growth in sales and improved returns. ", "This concludes our prepared remarks.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", " (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from Matt Nemer - Thomas Weisel Partners. ", "Matt Nemer - Thomas Weisel Partners", "If you could give us some feel for what you\u2019re seeing in the big-ticket outdoor power equipment category here in early April.", "James Wright", "In April, we\u2019ve seen a reversal on trend and positive comps, although I\u2019m sure you recall, Matt that last year April started with very, very soft results. So while it is certainly an improvement from what we\u2019ve seen thus far this year, we are cycling up for an easy April.", "Matt Nemer - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Any change to your ordering plans in that category right now? I think at the analyst that you mentioned that you were thinking units would be down but price average ticket would drive the dollars higher?", "James Wright", "Yes, we are still believing that that will be as the year plays out, our new premium product is doing really quite well and at the same point in time we are being conservative of the amount of inventory we have on hand and are frankly well positioned to exit the season whether or not we hit our expectations. ", "Matt Nemer - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I just wanted to turn to the expense management program that you mentioned. Is it possible to quantify the potential impact of that and has that factored into your commentary on the previous guidance provided?", "Anthony Crudele ", "Matt, what we have done is gone through and identified in various categories, some more into variable categories versus discretionary. We have been able to quantify that, but it does relate significantly to how we perform on the sales line. So there\u2019s a lot of variability in the way that we will implement the program. It is reflected in our guidance. Obviously our guidance has a change relative to the overall sales compared to the original guidance and the additional expenses as we measure them throughout the period are reflected in the revised EPS guidance. ", "Matt Nemer - Thomas Weisel Partners", "On the balance sheet, is there anything to read into the change in other accrued expenses?", "Anthony Crudele ", "No, there\u2019s really nothing in that needs to be identified there. The focus for us is really on the accounts payable and the inventory relationship.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Peter Benedict \u2013 Wachovia Capital Markets. ", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets", "How should we be thinking about the benefit that Q2 comps from the Easter shift? Should it be a similar 170 bps, a little more a little less?", "Anthony Crudele ", "Peter, if you look at the quarter, obviously a much larger sales volume. So therefore, as a percentage, it will be smaller, but I would guide you closer to a one and a half range versus a 1.7. ", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Can you talk a little bit about the trade down activity that you might be seeing in the store?", "James Wright", "Interesting that we are seeing the premium pet and premium equine consumer is holding firm. They continue to buy and we continue to see nice sales increases there. Folks that were buying in the middle, both with quality and bag size, are trending down to more of an economy and in some cases in pet to private brand, frankly that\u2019s margin positive for us. It\u2019s sales negative, a margin dollar and percent positive for us. There is some trade down in bag size and generally that is also margin positive. So when we add it all up, there is some shift in behavior, but nothing that would be detrimental to the PNL. ", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Can you talk a little bit about the drought conditions you\u2019re seeing?", "James Wright", "Certainly on a macro level across all of our markets, we are wetter and greener than a year ago. We have parts of the southeast remain seriously drought involved, but on a balance, at this point in time, we are in much better shape than a year ago. ", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Tony, can you give us the share count that you\u2019re assuming for the 08 EPS number? I think before you said that the guidance excluded buy back. I know you didn\u2019t do a ton, but your model is pretty sensitive to the share count, so can you give us a sense of what the share count number is you\u2019re assuming for the full year?", "Anthony Crudele ", "Yes, at the beginning of the year, other than some additional options that were granted, we were at $38.5 million and obviously as you stated, it does not include any additional share buy back. ", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets", "We should be assuming about $38.5 for the year?", "Anthony Crudele ", "Correct. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jeff Wimmer - JP Morgan.", "Jeff Wimmer \u2013 JP Morgan", "What\u2019s your new gross margin SG&A outlook for the year?", "Anthony Crudele ", "We give full year guidance and we update just on the EPS level and do not provide the detail. Well, we feel very good at relative to gross margin. Our earlier direction, we anticipated having increased and improved gross margins. We had given guidance that we thought would be tougher comparisons in the first quarter, but as we move forward, we expect it to show enhancement year-over-year. ", "When it comes to SG&A, we had again stated that we expected to de-leverage during the year; however, obviously our Q2 is one of our stronger sales performing quarters and we would anticipate having improved performance over Q1 obviously, but again, overall for the remainder of the year we expect SG&A to de-lever. ", "Jeff Wimmer \u2013 JP Morgan", "You had mentioned that therefore your customer is not discretionary sales, what percentage of your business is that really?", "Anthony Crudele ", "We go down, we take a look at the various categories, and obviously as we go through it, it\u2019s difficult to necessarily define particular items or categories as discretionary potentially impulse. So we tend not to share that information, because there is a loss subjectivity in doing that analysis. So we try it in various different ways. We do not restrain it to just those pure 6 to 8% of the two farmers that make a living, their main income from farming. So we\u2019ll tend to look at various items through different categories and create a basket. So we don\u2019t provide those details in subjective calculations.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Cumberland \u2013Robert W. Baird.", "David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "A few clarifications on the reduction in incremental expenses. Did you get any benefit from that in Q1?", "Anthony Crudele ", "Yes, David, we really started to take a hard look as we moved through February. Obviously January, as we stated, we did have a positive comp and sales did perform very similar to our expectations. As we moved into February, we started to take action near the end of February. So we had some impact principally in the month of March. ", "David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "And then the improvement you\u2019ve seen to date in April is that independent of the benefit you\u2019re getting from the Easter shift?", "Anthony Crudele ", "Yes it is. Again, as we moved into April, the performance on the sales line has been very consistent with our original 2008 outlook. ", "David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Then on the lower EPS guidance, does that reflect only Q1 or also, to some extent, a lower plan for the balance of the year?", "Anthony Crudele ", "Yes, it definitely includes a lower sales plan for not only Q1 but for the entire year offset by some of the expense control that we anticipate to have relative to that lower sales volume. ", "David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "With Q1 being by far your smallest quarter, does some of what you\u2019ve been doing on the targeted marketing side get really dialed back and then ramped up more starting in Q2 and then as you talked about the reductions in incremental expenses, I think Jim mentioned marketing is one of those items. I\u2019m curious about in what way you\u2019re taking out marketing costs.", "James Wright", "When we look at marketing, everything that our consumer would see that is linked to driving sales is pretty much from that in tax. We were down one circular in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. The rest of the year we anticipate cycling circulars with circulars. Our TV spend will be proportionate to last year. We\u2019re taking a very diligent look at research as an example. ", "We\u2019re taking a look at product costs as another example. We have a certain amount of marketing costs that we allocate each year for testing and we\u2019ve significantly reduced our scrapped marketing testing for this year. So fundamentally, Dave, we\u2019re sticking with the basics and investing in those vehicles that our customers are most likely to see and are most likely to drive traffic. ", "David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Then my initial marketing question was regarding the level that you do in Q1 versus Q2.", "James Wright", "Well, it would be substantially noisier in Q2 than Q1 for the obvious reason it\u2019s 20% of our business versus going to the high 20% of our business and really out-of-season versus in-season activity. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Peter Keith - Piper Jaffray.", "Peter Keith - Piper Jaffray", "I just had a question on the gross margin and, Tony, I believe on the last quarter you were anticipating maybe a negative mix shift from the spring that happened last year. That looks like the opposite. It happened actually mix shift with a benefit, because of lower mower sales. So how should we think about that based on how things are stepping back here in early April? We\u2019re now thinking about a negative mix shift early on in the quarter.", "Anthony Crudele ", "I think that would be appropriate given that the mix shift that we experience, obviously we talked about big tickets, but big tickets also including riders. We saw that mix shift predominantly in March where it was colder, where we had less rider sales. So anticipating stronger rider sales in April should have a negative impact on the mix from a margin perspective. ", "Peter Keith - Piper Jaffray", "Are there other items that are higher margin like fertilizer or other seasonable items that you\u2019re now selling though that could offset that a bit?", "James Wright", "Potentially, and it could be offset really by our markdown cadence as we move through spring goods. As we demonstrated in the first quarter, we managed through that process very well, as well as some of our price optimization initiatives or strategies being employed throughout that quarter and having that ramp up to a certain extent. So we think there are definitely ways to circumvent some of that negative impact of the mix of the hard line goods. ", "Peter Keith - Piper Jaffray", "Just on how you\u2019re seeing things here in April, just to make sure that we\u2019re clear on the trend. You said that the sales here in April are pulled back to the original plan. Does that serve your original full year of guidance of one to three comp or was it your plan around Q2 that serve the internal?", "Anthony Crudele ", "It was really to our internal plan from Q2 and obviously we are cycling a very weak April, so it would be logical to assume that our planning for April is stronger than the zero to two or the one to three that we talked about for the full year. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jack Murphy - William Blair.", "Jack Murphy - William Blair", "Someone mentioned about your expectations for the last three quarters of the year. Could you give us a sense how much lower your expectation is for the comp on average for those three quarters?", "Anthony Crudele ", "We really like to try to stick to just update our full year guidance in total versus trying to break it out by quarter or the remaining three quarters of the year. ", "Jack Murphy - William Blair", "You talked about gas prices impacting the comp in the past, is that figuring in heavily into the way you\u2019re looking at that. Have you seen some sensitivity this time around?", "James Wright", "Obviously the first quarter, we saw our traffic count was down 2.9% of comp came from actually it was 3.8% decline in store traffic. Certainly it was related, I think overall consumer sentiments, certainly gas was a piece of that. It\u2019s very difficult, everything is swirling around right now for us to break out any one variable and point to that as key to our consumer\u2019s behavior. ", "Jack Murphy - William Blair", "Did I hear you correctly that you may push six to eight stores out into \u201909 and if that\u2019s the case, could you talk about a little bit more about what the thinking is there? Is it logistics or something to do with sales performance, pre-opening expenses? What\u2019s going on there?", "Anthony Crudele ", "There is obviously a drag on December openings. November openings, there\u2019s also a drag. On stores we opened in January the following year, there\u2019s a pre-opening cost drag in December. We see this as; first of all, the right thing to do for this year and also it will allow us to reposition ourselves to frontload new stores more heavily in the first half as we go forward over the ensuing years. ", "Jack Murphy - William Blair", "In terms of sales productivity, there are no surprises there?", "Anthony Crudele ", "Yes, it\u2019s in our forecast. As we talk about the overall range, we brought down the overall range forecast for the year and that is reflected in that new number.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Wayne Hood - BMO Capital.", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets", "Yes, Jim, back to stores a second. Why not in this environment over the next few years, why not back that store opening plan down more aggressively. You could still be considered a high-growth retailer at 9% unit growth rather than 13% and you could probably do a little bit more predictable and it\u2019s not like anybody you\u2019re racing to get site, I\u2019m just thinking why not contemplate that? ", "Another question I had is has there been any adjustments to bonus accruals in light of the revisions to sales plans here and if so, how does that impact the store managers who really are not, they look at you setting the plan and you\u2019re already missing a plan three months into the haul and if you\u2019re saying I\u2019m not going to make my bonus for the year, sometimes management turnover goes up in that environment. So how you dealing with that?", "James Wright", "Yes, we think it\u2019s prudent this year to push a few stores into next year. We remain committed to our 12% to 13% growth. If I looked into a crystal ball and said we\u2019re going to be in this consumer malaise for three years, I would have a different answer. My crystal ball says three to five quarters on the outside. That\u2019s my best guess and we are a growth company. ", "We have an entire engine from store management developments, store management training, a real estate team, a very, very long pipeline that is easy to stop and very expensive to rebuild. So if we were to stop slow growth to 9% and then in some ensuing year seek to accelerate back to 12% or 13%, we would incur a drag in earnings at that time. With the visibility we have right now, we have chosen to stay at the 12% to 13% growth. ", "With our guide to store management turnover and the impact of the economy have on them, our store managers and district managers have a tremendous amount of authorship in the plans for their stores. Bonus payouts were not great last year either unfortunately, because we win as a team and we suffer as a team and last year our store manager turnover was flat for the prior year and Q1 of this year it is actually beneath that of last year and I\u2019m extremely proud of our team. They\u2019re highly energized. ", "Also bear in mind that our store managers are compensated not only on store level four wall profit at end of year; they\u2019re also compensated monthly on hitting their sales plan. So on individual store level, they have a tremendous amount of opportunity to drive the sales and be successful. ", "Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets", "Where can we expect your inventory per store to be down at the end of the second quarter, particularly in some of the seasonal categories, as we look coming into the second quarter?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I would tell you that similar to what we probably experienced here from fourth quarter into first quarter, it won\u2019t be as steep going forward, because we\u2019ve made a lot of adjustments as we move forward so that slope will be much less, but it will continue to improve. It\u2019s really as much as bringing inventory down by stores as it is the quality of that inventory as well. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re out in our stores and you\u2019ve got to be noticing that the quality of the inventory is coming up. We\u2019re crisper, we\u2019re going to be cleaner, and that\u2019s also going to add to long-term, the profitability of the company as we move through the third and fourth quarter. So it\u2019s a balance of both. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest.", "Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest Securities", "I just wanted to stick on the inventory issue for a second. Playing the role of devil\u2019s advocate, saying that conditions actually worsen from here. What areas of the store would you look to trim back in terms of inventory? The routers and larger OP would be easy answer, but if you look at the rest of the store, where would you want to lighten up?", "Anthony Crudele ", "To be very honest with you, it is early in the game for us. Second quarter tells us a lot about how the year will perform. We made the appropriate adjustments in the plan as we saw the business developing through the latter part of fourth quarter and into early first. So I would tell you, I won\u2019t give you anything specific as to this area or that area. You hit on that on the rider business and the OP business is definitely one that you have to watch closely. We have done the following though. We have asked a number of our vendor partners to hold some more inventory. ", "Basically, as the business opens up, we can reach in and start to pull some merchandise forward. We\u2019re being very cautious also with our placements overseas. We\u2019re buying more to I think the appetite of what we see right now in the market in our consumer base. So there\u2019s nothing specific. It\u2019s still very early to sit there and try to forecast what we think the year is going to be. ", "Jay McCanless - FTN Midwest Securities", "I know you said in the prepared remarks that you all bought two stores this year. Is there any thought with real estate prices moving down in certain areas to go into more owned stores versus leased stores?", "James Wright", "We\u2019ve addressed that question in the past and we believe that there will be some opportunities. It would not be a main strategy, but where we can use our capital to improve our store productivity and least percentage cost, we will aggressively go after that. So if opportunities do present themselves, we think we\u2019re in a good position to be able to execute on that strategy.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Lawrence - Morgan Keegan.", "John Lawrence - Morgan Keegan", "Could you update us a little bit, I know you talked about it on the fourth quarter call, just another update on the 50-store test on the left side of the store. I know it\u2019s still early, but just a little update there first of all.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes, let me speak to that just for a moment. What we are learning is that some of the things that we have tested we now are relatively confident that we can take in and roll to the chain and there are a handful of those that are actually in play right now and will be into the stores by the end of second, early third quarter. We\u2019re still not I would say totally convinced that that complete relay, the expense, and the time that is involved, that that\u2019s the right thing to do for the chain at this point. They\u2019re having some great wins. There have been some areas where they\u2019re still, to be honest with you, we\u2019re now getting into the peak of our season, we\u2019ll learn more. We said that earlier. When this went into play, it was really in the down part of our sales cycle. So we needed some time, but we are taking some of the early wins right now that we can document and say \u2013 good, let\u2019s move those forward and we\u2019re placing those into the stores, but I will tell you that through second quarter, I think we\u2019ll have update to then say \u2013 okay, wins, losses, and retrench. So you\u2019ve got to give us at least another quarter. ", "John Lawrence - Morgan Keegan", "Okay, but there are some positives you\u2019re saying in April with some of that?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes, there are. ", "John Lawrence - Morgan Keegan", "Jim, just to follow on the last question about the two pieces of land or parcels, how would you put that in context related to the golden mile versus silver mile of where those are in the real estate plan and obviously good returns to be able to buy those. How would you put that in context?", "James Wright", "We review it very opportunistically, but the primary drivers of that decision is \u2013 one, it\u2019s an opportunistic price. Two, we have a high confidence that the retail traffic is moving to the site over a 10 or 15 year period of time so that obviously the real estate appreciation would be accretive to the investment decision. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Andrew Wolf - BB&T.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "", "First on your update on the quarter to date business trend, are you able to tell us if the positive comp in both the ticket on the transaction count or is the transaction count still trending negatively?", "Anthony Crudele ", "You\u2019re looking at comparison as you move into April.", "", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "", "I think you\u2019ve been saying the first three weeks have been a little better and you\u2019re comping positively and I\u2019m asking when you break that down between ticket and traffic, is it all ticket with still a negative traffic trend or has your traffic improved?", "Anthony Crudele ", "You see it on both sides and it\u2019s actually slightly stronger in the transaction side than on the average ticket side, but again, let me stress that last year was very soft and it\u2019s a very easy comparison and was extremely cold in the April timeframe. So as we move into a warmer April, you will see that there is an easier comparison and we would anticipate that transactions would be up and drive that comp store number. ", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "", "To your statement on managing payroll, I think you mentioned as one of the variable costs you can manage, is that going to affect hours of operation potentially or more in terms of payroll?", "James Wright", "It\u2019s just, Andrew, this is standard and it\u2019s just good payroll management that we install any time a business trend shift up or down to curve the payroll accordingly to the sales rate. So as you look at a payroll percentage to total sales, we manage that and although it\u2019s never easy to reduce hours, it\u2019s emotional; however, we\u2019re not reducing it any more than we would if those sales numbers were set for the stores at the beginning of the year. So it\u2019s something we do all the time and something we will continuing doing. ", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "", "Lastly, in some past quarters, maybe it\u2019s not as relevant here. You\u2019ve spoken to Life-O, there\u2019s so much inflation out there, at least in some of the categories, feed and so on. Did Life-O have any meaningful effect and what are you looking for for the year?", "Anthony Crudele ", "In the quarter, it was not significantly above prior year, so therefore we had no comment on it. As we look to the entire year, we believe that potentially it can be higher than what we had originally viewed it to be when we set our 2008 guidance and our 2008 plan; however, not dramatically different at this stage and obviously it\u2019s very early as the key drivers are the price index and the growth and inventory balance at the end of the year will drive that calculation. So it\u2019s a little bit too early to tell. We do anticipate that that number would drive a little bit higher than what we originally had forecasted. ", "Operator", "There are no further questions. ", "James Wright", "To close, I would just like to remind everyone that we understand our customers, we understand their needs that we have and we continue to take action to reduce our costs while we continue to build customer loyalty through offering compelling value on core lifestyle products. While we certainly all agree that the near term is going to be challenging, our long-term future remains very, very bright. I look forward to speaking to you all at the end of Q2.

", "James F. Wright ", "Good afternoon everyone.  I am joined today by Tony Crudele, our Chief Financial Officer, Stan Ruta, EVP of Store Operations and Greg Sandfort, EVP of Merchandising. As most of you know, the second quarter is very important to our business as it is our quarter with the highest sales and profitability.  Our team overcame headwinds and I am pleased with our performance during the second quarter.  I\u2019m also pleased with the diligence and superior execution of everyone on our team.  We made solid progress during the quarter on our initiatives to both grow and to improve our business.  At the same time, we gained traction on our expense management program which was designed to protect our business in the near term.  I will discuss these initiatives in greater detail later in the call but first, let me provide a few highlights from the second quarter. ", "We grew total sales by 13.6%, earnings per share by 14.8% while we maintained our commitment to long term value creation.  Second, we continued to improve inventory management and ended the quarter with a 1.3% decrease in overall and a 12.2% reduction in the average inventory per store compared to Q2 of last year.  Our ability to control inventory levels while improving our in stock position is attributed to the execution of our merchants, our supply chain and our store operators.  This marks the third consecutive quarter of improved inventory efficiency.  Finally, we continue to focus on a grade of categories most relevant to the every needs of our customers.  ", "Our core consumable categories including animal and pet related products remain robust and were key drivers of sales during the quarter and in the first half.  Through these categories we continue to experience sold traffic and repeat business in our stores.  We\u2019re very pleased that our transactions are up despite higher gas prices which are forcing consumers to consolidate shopping trips.  We continue to closely observe traffic, measure customer [inaudible] and trends in our stores.  All that said, we\u2019ve never been more confident in our model, in our growth potential and our capacity to create value over the long term.  ", "As we head in to the second half of the year, I want to thank our team members for their continued dedication to carry out our plans each and every day.  During this challenging time we asked the team to step up significantly and they performed very well and are continuing to execute across all customer service, sales and expense management goals.  I commend them for their hard work and appreciate their loyalty.  In conclusion, early in the year we recognized the shifting consumer environment and reacted quickly by developing additional programs to mitigate potential headwinds.  We executed quite well in the first half and I\u2019ll go in to more details about our plans in the second half later in the call.  But first, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tony to review our financial reforms during the quarter and provide a financial outlook for the remainder of the year.", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Good afternoon everyone.  During the quarter we were very pleased with our top line results.  Our sales performance provided us the ability to effectively manage gross margin and control inventory levels despite increases in commodity prices.  For the second quarter ended June 28, 2008 sales increased 13.6% to $898.3 million compared to last year\u2019s second quarter and net income of $47 million or $1.24 per diluted share compared to $43.8 million or $1.08 per diluted share in the same period last year.   ", "Total comp sales for the period increased 3.4% and non-comp sales were approximately $78.3 million or 8.7% of sales.  We accomplished this despite another difficult year for outdoor power equipment.  We are pleased that we have been able to shape our assortment to have less of a dependency on the outdoor power equipment category as that industry continues to experience weakness.  Please note that we had an additional selling day in the second quarter due to the Easter shift in the first quarter this year.  As a result, the additional day positively impacted Q2 comps by approximately 110 basis points.  Comp sales in our Del stores were below the company average.  ", "Consistent with positive trends from earlier in the year, our core consumable business continues to perform well in the second quarter.  Although consumers remain conservative with their spending habits on discretionary and big ticket items, we did see signs that the consumer would step up for functional or differentiated categories or when we offered a compelling value proposition.  These categories that performed well included recreational vehicles, chainsaws, scythes and tillers.  We also are very pleased with the improvement in comp transactions which increased 170 basis points.  We believe that this increase in transactions supports that our customers has functional necessities and views Tractor Supply as a destination store.  Average ticket was also up 1.6% primarily as a result of our ability to pass through commodity cost increases.", "Sales trends throughout the quarter were consistent with our expectations.  We had strong comp sales in April as we cycled a very cold April in the prior year.  May was the weakest comparison on a year-over-year basis as we cycled the carryover sales from the cold April into May last year.   From a weather perspective June was the most normalized month and we had a favorable comp consistent with the total comp for the quarter.  With respect to regional sales trends, comp sales were positive in all regions for tractor supply stores.  The cold weather states performed the best and benefited from a more modest April.  The warm weather states were weaker than chain average comps for two different reasons, during the quarter Texas cycled very strong comp performance from the prior year which was driven by a very wet spring last year.  In the south, the overall challenging economy continued to particular affect Florida and as a result we experienced softer sales in this market.  ", "Gross margin declined 55 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.  This declined resulted principally from an increase in freight expense and an increase in the LIFO reserve.  Although overall gross margin decreased, product margins improved 40 basis points.  This resulted principally from better buying and retail price increases.  There was a limited impact on margin from the mix of merchandise sold.  This was because the favorable impact from fewer rider sales was offset by lower than chain average margin of the increase consumable mix.  The improved product margin was offset by 33 basis points of freight expense resulting from increased yield costs and a mix of goods that carries higher than chain average freight costs.  Freight expense was favorably impacted by reduced purchases as a result of our inventory management program and less important purchases.  ", "LIFO represented a 42 basis point increase over prior year as grain, oil and steel costs have escalated this year.  In the prior year the LIFO charge was essentially flat as the flow of merchandise, inventory position and our projection of price increase at the end of the quarter did not necessitate increasing the reserve.  Import purchases on a year-to-date basis decreased 115 basis points from the prior year, the lack of increase in import volume reflects our success in reducing inventory and improving turns.  In addition, the continued strength of our core consumable business which is domestically sourced also contributed to this decline.  We expect to have a slight decrease in our importing efforts this year as we continue to manage inventory for certain key import categories such as hand tools and power tools.", "For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation as a percent of sales was 22.5%, a decrease of approximately 15 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year.  All key categories of SG&A other than occupancy showed leverage as a percent of sales.  Additionally, SG&A per store was down for the quarter.  We did benefit from a slight shift of marketing expense in to the third quarter relating to the timing of a direct mail piece.  This had a favorable impact of approximately $0.01 per share in the second quarter.   This improvement in SG&A leverage was offset by expected deleveraging from occupancy expense primarily as a result of our store opening program.  That said, we continue to make progress on reducing this headwind for the long term.", "Our cost containment initiatives have been very effective and we continue to focus on reducing non-essential costs while managing through the tough economic environment.  Marketing was a prime example as we reduced the comparable spend this year in the second quarter.  We ran the same number of circulars as in the prior year but managed to cost better and limited some of the more discretionary spending.  Exclusive of the direct marketing shift I mentioned earlier, we reduced our anticipated spend by $0.01 per share for the second quarter.  In the second quarter we opened 23 stores compared to 20 store openings and one store reduction in the prior year as we sold our one Del store in Canada.  Pre-opening expenses were approximately $2.6 million compared to $2.3 million in the prior quarter.  ", "Turning now to a few key balance sheet items.  Inventory management has been a key focus and this is the third consecutive quarter we are realizing the benefits of our efforts.  We are pleased with the position of our spring seasonal inventory and have managed to aggressively clear merchandise while maintaining margins.  We believe that Greg and Stan\u2019s teams can continue to drive improvement in this area through the remainder of the year.  On a per store basis at quarter end, inventory levels decreased approximately 12.2% compared to the prior year.  Our calculations based on average costs of inventory and excluding in transit inventory and inventory held in unopened stores.  Inventory turns improved 11 basis points to 2.77 turns on an annualized year-to-date basis.  This was principally as a result of the better inventory management.  We believe our improved inventory management will continue through the remainder of the year and we are well positioned to exceed our annual turns improvement target of 15 basis points. ", "We also improved our accounts payable financing of inventory from approximately 49.1% up to 55.4% resulting principally from better accounts payable management and vendor dating.  The merchant team continues to make progress on this initiative that we began last year.  We are optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to drive leverage over the next two quarters as we cycle the program.  ", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $27 million, the majority of which relates to our new store opening program.  Year-to-date cap ex totaled $53.5 million which included $8.5 million for the acquisition of two store properties in the first quarter.  No properties were acquired in the second quarter.  In the first half of last year, cap ex totaled $44.7 million.  During the second quarter we purchased approximately 738,000 shares for $25 million for a cumulative total of $177.9 million since the inception of our stock repurchase program in February, 2007.  Our share repurchase program had a favorable impact on EPS for the quarter of approximately $0.01.  Subject to prevailing marketing conditions, we expect to continue to make additional purchases as part of our long term objective of reducing our cost of capital.  ", "In addition to our generation of free cash flow from operations, our inventory and accounts payable financing initiatives have been instrumental in providing us the liquidity to fund $178 million of stock repurchases over the last year and a half.  Most importantly, we have been able to fund store growth and the related inventory without adding any debt.  In comparing this year\u2019s cash flow with the first half of last year, we generated over $60 million of working capital improvement from our inventory and accounts payable financing initiatives.  We\u2019re extremely proud of this achievement and we continue to allocate our capital efficiently and make strategic investments in our business.", "Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of 2008.  We remain committed to improving the business while growing the chain throughout the year.  As a part of our cost management program we have prudently managed our capital expenditures.  We still anticipate cap ex spending to be between $90 and $95 million excluding any purchases of store properties which is consistent with the guidance we provided on the first quarter conference call.  As part of our long term commitment to grow the business, we are on track with our store growth target and anticipate opening approximately 88 to 93 stores for the full year.  In the balance of this year the remaining store openings will be Tractor Supply stores as we have already reached our targeted Del stores for the year.  ", "With respect to our specific financial expectation for 2008, as noted in today\u2019s press release, we continue to expect same store sales for the year to be approximately flat to 2%.  Given the expected timing of new store openings, we now expect there will be slightly fewer selling weeks from the new store openings in 2008.  Accordingly, we\u2019ve narrowed the top end of our 2008 sales expectations by $10 million to a range of $2.98 billion to $3.03 billion.  With respect to earnings expectations, at the end of Q1 we indicated we were trending at or slightly below the low end of our previously provided range of $2.54 to $2.62 for the full year 2008.  At that time we stated that we could provide a more definitive outlook after we had concluded the first half of the year since the second quarter is typically our largest quarter for sales and profitability.  With that said, we now expect to achieve annual net earnings of between $2.49 and $2.55 per diluted share.  Importantly, this range is consistent with our expectations when we reported Q1.  ", "To provide some further detail in fine tuning our outlook for the back half of the year, we considered several factors.  First, to be sure we are managing through an uncertain retail environment where there can be variability.  We have prepared our outlook based on the current consumer environment and notwithstanding any potential change in their spending patterns.  However, we believe we have strong plans in place that are allowing us to navigate through the second half.  Second, the consumer continues to shop our stores for their functional non-discretionary items.  We continue to see positive trends in consumables which translates in to footsteps.  We believe that this was consistent throughout the second quarter adjusting for the variability year-over-year weather patterns and this has continued in to July.  ", "Third, based on our forecasted weather trends, we believe there will be less negative impact from weather variability in the second half.  As you know, in the first half of the year, specifically February and March, weather comparisons provided a significant headwind.  Looking at the second half of the year there is less variation.  We expect moisture levels to be slightly improved over last year as we move through the summer months and we expect that the cooler weather will come a little earlier in the fall season.  Fourth, there is less dependency on big ticket items in the second half of the year than in the first half.  Although we have a variety of large ticket items throughout all the seasons, as we move in to the fall season, we believe that many of the heating related larger ticket items will face fewer headwinds in the event that gas prices remain high and people look for alternative low cost heating sources. ", "Having said all this, we do have a cautious outlook when it comes to consumer sentiment when we head in to the holiday season and we will continue to monitor this very closely throughout the remainder of the year.  Additionally, we are planning for slightly lower gross margins for the second half versus the prior year\u2019s period given the expected fuel costs, current merchandise mix and our ongoing inventory management initiatives.  At the same time, we have been very successful in aggressively managing operating expenses and we anticipate this will continue to positively impact operating margins and the bottom line.  ", "As you are hearing throughout today\u2019s call, we are very pleased that we have the right strategies in place.  Our team has proven they are nimble and flexible enough to execute well in this environment.  We believe this will be a key differentiator for us with customers and we believe this will translate well in to positive operating results in 2008 and beyond.  Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Jim who will discuss more details on plans for the remainder of this year.", "James F. Wright ", "As we enter the back half of the year, we\u2019ll continue to be very deliberate in our actions and committed to crisp execution.  We\u2019re mindful of the current economic environment and are very carefully observing fuel prices.  However, we believe that our efforts to lower costs will continue to allow us to operate as a much leaner and more powerful organization.  We also expect that our initiatives to grow and to improve our business and to focus on our people will continue to gain traction.  We expect to continue expense management.", "As mentioned in our last call, we\u2019ve been reducing incremental and discretionary costs in our business.  We\u2019re managing our cost very tightly and have placed additional rigor around eliminating waste and managing hours to sales on a by store by week basis.  Further, we\u2019ve reduced expenses in marketing, our store support center, transportation, distribution technology as well as business travel. If necessary, we are prepared to quickly implement additional cost cutting actions should the consumer retrench more significantly.  Second, Tractor Supply is a growth company.  Despite the overall consumer environment there are several opportunities for us to grow sales and profits by maintaining our store expansion program, refining our merchandise selection, improving margins via price optimization and strategic sourcing and building out our ecommerce platform.  ", "In addition, we\u2019ll continue to find ways to increase sales within our existing stores by refining our merchandise assortment presentation.  We expect our core consumable products will continue to produce solid and consistent results driven by our ability to serve a functional and non-discretionary need.  As we enter another get ready quarter, we are preparing for the next seasonal shift and we believe that we are in a good position to capitalize on our home heating related merchandise.  We also expect to continue growing in the second half by building out our ecommerce offering.  We\u2019re seeing success of our online strategy.  We currently have 11,000 SKUs for sale online and we expect sales to continue ramping up in the back half of this year so that we can begin leveraging ecommerce in 2009.  ", "Third, as we look to improve areas of our business, we\u2019ll pay particular attention to certain merchandising initiatives such as price optimization, price elasticity and inventory management in the second half.  Although we had to modify our approach to price optimization due to inflationary pressures occurring through currently with an increased consumer price sensitivity, we remain confident in our ability to achieve a profitable balance of growth in margin and in market share.  In addition, we\u2019ve been pleased with the improvements in our inventory management process.  As a result of a more rigorous focus, we\u2019ve reduced our average inventory per store for three consecutive quarters.  We anticipate that we\u2019ll continue to effectively execute our inventory management goals in the second half.  ", "Finally, turning to our people; in recent years we\u2019ve placed an emphasis on reducing store manager turnover.  Today, I\u2019m delighted that our year-to-date store manager turnover rate is 2% less than last year\u2019s record low.  Our store managers and their team have a very direct impact on customer loyalty and in turn, sales and profitability of the chain.  With that said, it\u2019s important to remember why Tractor Supply Company is unique and well positioned to succeed in the near and in the long term.  We serve a unique niche, we are dedicated to an understand the dynamics of our niche and as a result we are able to successfully operate and grow in this market.  Additionally, we have limited and fragmented competition.  As we often like to say, \u201cYou can buy everything we carry somewhere else but you can\u2019t find someplace else that sells everything we carry.\u201d We are one of a kind.", "As a result, we are able to meet the functional and non-discretionary needs of those who are committed to living the rural lifestyle.  As a category [inaudible] we bring efficiencies to our market which drives customer loyalty.  I\u2019m very pleased to say that during these challenging times, their reliance on Tractor Supply remains strong.  We have a solid foundation in place.   We have no debt and we can be nimble in this environment.  Lastly, we have an experienced and focused management team that has managed successfully through many challenging cycles.  In short, our merchandise assortment is on target and getting better each quarter.  Our customers are resilient, our team is committed, our financial position is strong and our company is growing.", "This concludes our prepared remarks.  Operator, we would like to open the call for questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Our first question comes from Mitch Kaiser \u2013 Piper Jaffray.", "Mitch Kaiser \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "One of the first questions I wanted to talk about, I know it\u2019s difficult to quantify but is it possible to look at what impact the stimulus checks may have had on your business?", "James F. Wright ", "Mitch, it\u2019s very difficult for us to quantify for a couple of reasons: one, they came out over an extended period of time and frankly when we look at kind of a sales rate that we experienced, it\u2019s just very, very difficult for us to correlate that.  We did nothing special, you know some retailers cashed the checks free but we did not take that initiative.", "Mitch Kaiser \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "You mentioned a couple of times in terms of merchandise for the back half of the year, home heating might be a nice opportunity as you head in the back half of the year certainly with what people are talking about with natural gas prices and heating oil costs, I would assume that would be a good product for you.  Can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re going to do on the merchandising side there and assuming a strong demand, does it feel like the products going to be available?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "First of all, we identified this trend early on in the year and we actually did some early testing in a number of stores in the northern part of where we serve our customer.  The initial response was so strong that we quickly went back to the manufacturing base and started laying the foundation for growing this business.  All I can tell you is that we\u2019re well prepared, we\u2019re well positioned, we have worked closely with the manufacturers and we believe that this is going to be a significant opportunity for us in third quarter.  What we\u2019re not sure about is whether or not the business will come early and will stay with us through the remainder of the late third and fourth or if it will just come early and come fast and furious but, we\u2019re well prepared and feel very solid about the business as we go forward.", "Mitch Kaiser \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "So assuming that you do get strong demand in the third quarter, does it feel like you could backfill in the fourth quarter if that demand followed through then?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "We have plans to do so, yes.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Jack Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company.", "Jack Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Just a couple of questions that relate to the guidance.  Can you talk about your view in to the trends on freight on the next couple of quarters?  I know you kind of ticked up from say 25 basis point drag to a 33 basis point drag, just what sort of is assumed in the guidance for that?  Then secondly, when you look at the ramp on merchandising initiatives that you kicked off, I guess late last year in to early this year, what type of impact, how do you view the sort of ramp on those merchandising initiatives on the back half of the year?", "James F. Wright ", "First on the freight, we assumed $4.70 a gallon diesel for the remainder of the year.  Our initial planning was based on the Department of Transportation $3.30 for the year so when we talk about our EPS range for the year, that\u2019s already calculated in.  Any relief would certainly be appreciated.  With regard to merchandise, Greg do you want to take that?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Jack, we put together a number of initiatives for 08 and I think we talked briefly the last couple of calls about certain aspects of the business. Particularly one we were working on was new product flow, resets in our store, the execution on those resets, trying to make the store and for [Sam\u2019s] team out there much easier to operate and run.  We\u2019ve got new processes in place for planograms, for line reviews, for what we call SDIs, our sales driving initiatives so we are well planned, we believe we can execute very, very easily to these plans.  We work very closely with the store ops group, they are integrated in to what we do now so I believe we are going to execute at a very high level.", "Jack Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company", "As you look at the overall impact that you\u2019ve seen so far it\u2019s mostly been an offset to some other drags on the gross margin.  Could you kind of characterize how far along you are in terms of realizing a benefit [inaudible] or sort of multi quarter benefit that you see accruing not just the back half but 09 and beyond?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "I\u2019d say that we were in the early stages of seeing the benefit.  One of the things I mentioned last call is that we were going to clear the stores of clutter and we\u2019ve been working diligently on that.  If you\u2019ve been in our stores, you should notice that we\u2019ve been moving to a number of I\u2019ll call discontinued or old age products and reinvesting those monies in to forward product, in to our core basics and so on which are going to benefit us on the margin side because those are much richer in margins. So, that\u2019s just one aspect, there\u2019s numerous other things that we\u2019re doing Jack but as I said, we\u2019re in the early innings here.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from David Cumberland \u2013 Baird.", "David Cumberland \u2013 Baird ", "Have you seen a change in the extent that you\u2019re able to pass through cost increases related to commodities?  ", "James F. Wright ", "Yes, we have.  For the first part of the second quarter we were able to pass commodity increase through and maintain the margin rate.  Obviously, we watch unit velocity and market share very, very closely and we\u2019ve began to see some measure of units decline or some resistance and change in strategies we\u2019re at the point now where in most categories, most commodities, our strategy now is to maintain a $1.00 or $0.01 per unit profit and thus far, I guess we\u2019ve been moving against it now for seven or eight weeks, it looks like we\u2019re doing just fine.", "David Cumberland \u2013 Baird ", "Then Jim, in some past calls you\u2019ve talked about recently starting to measure customer service levels, what kind of update can you give us on that particularly as you\u2019ve been managing down expenses?", "James F. Wright ", "Sure.  Stan, do you want to take that?", "Stanley L. Ruta ", "Sure.  David, we\u2019re in the early stages of measuring customer loyalty in our stores.  We\u2019re very pleased with our initial response from our customers, we\u2019re getting great information by store, by day, by [inaudible] day which is helping us correct staffing adjustments and react by store to our opportunities in customer service.  Again, we\u2019re very early in that program, we see great benefit in front of us and our customers \u2013 we can see where we\u2019re reacting well, our customers recognizing it and rating us high.", "James F. Wright ", "As we compare the actual output, what we measure is top box score, customers rate us one through five, we count five\u2019s only and frankly we\u2019ve seen very, very little degradation as we got in season and with the relatively vigorous control on expenses.  It is so minor that we were unable to discern if this was a result of more tightly managing salary or just the fact that our stores are just much busier in Q2 then they are in Q1.  So, I guess overall our customers continue to give us very good marks on overall customer satisfaction.", "David Cumberland \u2013 Baird ", "My last question, on freight optimization, have you put all of your efforts there on hold or is there some aspect of it that you\u2019re still moving forward with.", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "David, we\u2019re still moving forward on that front.  With the inflationary pressures, we\u2019ve been very cautious to look at how those two are going to blend and basically what we\u2019ve done is a little bit of a blend program right now where we\u2019ve estimated what we think the customer threshold will be on price and what were our plans initially.  So, no, we\u2019re moving ahead but it\u2019s been very judicious on how we go about it.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Matt Nemer \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners ", "My first question is on the slower store growth that is planned for the second half.  Can you just comment on any impact that would have to expenses that\u2019s implied in your guidance?  Then, can you give us maybe a preview of what we should be thinking about in 2009 for new stores?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Relative to the new stores, the guidance that we gave at the end of Q1 we had said that we had anticipated at the very beginning of the year about 95 to 100.  We said that we would not be concerned if six to eight stores were pushed back in to 2009.  So, generally the guidance that we\u2019re giving today is consistent with our discussions at the end of Q1.  There is some limited pre-opening favorable impact.  The rents will adjust quarterly for the unopened period but again, relative to those six to eight stores, some of the other stores that are opening are opening a little bit later than we had originally planned so we\u2019re having less store selling weeks.  There will be some operating impact but not significant relative to the reduction we\u2019ve given in the sales.  And again, that sales estimate really was on the top end of the sales range and we\u2019re just trying to again, manage the expectation there relative to the comp guidance that we\u2019re providing as well.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners ", "Then I guess thinking about 09, any early indication for where we should be relative to the 08 number?", "James F. Wright ", "We\u2019re thinking at this point of time, it\u2019s still subject to some change because we have not put the plans to bed, but kind of given the current conditions we believe that will be probably close to flat in units next year.  Historically, the last four or five years now, we\u2019ve been running at roughly a 13% unit growth rate.  We think that we will stay flat with 90 to 95 units next year, is our current thinking.  Now, having said that, if we find that things comes to us opportunistically, obviously we\u2019re likely to change that number.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners ", "Then secondly, can you just talk about your performance in the OPE category during the quarter from both a growth and market share standpoint?", "James F. Wright ", "The industry, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the reports, it turned out that once again, as the year went on, the industry continued to issues increasingly soft results.  The industry is 11% to 12% down for the year.  I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019re going to come out for the year due to the fact that its [inaudible] and we\u2019re still selling in some parts of the country but I would say that market share for us in the higher price points we\u2019ll probably be fine, Matt we may even gain some mid priced points.  We may not be performing as well as overall industry but we really need to see the year end because it is not a good year and as Tony mentioned in his remarks we have worked now to decrease our dependability when it comes to profitability, not necessarily comp sales but in terms of profitability we have decreased our dependency on particularly riding lawn mowers in Q2.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners ", "Then lastly, can you talk to your marketing plans in the second half of the year given the election and the Olympics?  Do you plan to be aggressive or a little bit quieter than normal?", "James F. Wright ", "Our share of print and share of voice will be very, very similar to last year.  The discretionary spend, market research, things along those lines we obviously have reduced as part of our project trim initiative.  But, for the most part we\u2019ll have the same number of events, maybe some greater emphasis on direct mail, perhaps a little less emphasis on television but, for the most part we\u2019ll be, I guess, as nosey as we were last year.  ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from John Lawrence \u2013 Morgan Keegan.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Morgan Keegan ", "Jim, would you comment just a little bit \u2013 congratulations on getting the costs cuts, can you talk about those cost cuts first half compared to second half would it be basically the same type of mix of those items that you talked about, the store expenses and marketing?", "James F. Wright ", "The marketing, we had one non-recurring piece of marketing, right?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Correct.  Relative to the expense management, we would anticipate to be able to impact SG&A to the same extent other than that shift of the $1 million or that penny we talked about on the direct mail piece.  So, we\u2019ll see that shift into Q3 but other than that we believe that we\u2019ll be able to manage expenses to the same extent that we did in the first half. ", "John Lawrence \u2013 Morgan Keegan ", "Secondly, just a product question.  Greg, with I guess three summers now of tough outdoor power equipment sales, have you seen any correlation with more accessories, more belts, that type of things, people keeping mowers longer?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "John, it\u2019s ironic that you mention that because we forecasted early on in the year, actually last fall, that we felt that there could be a little bit of a downturn in unit purchase.  Customers were going in to high end or very low end.  But, we thought that there would be a ramp up in the accessories and the replacement parts and sure enough, that\u2019s what happened.  It didn\u2019t come until later but, it has become fast and furious now since early part of May and we\u2019ve seen nice improvement there in our business.  So, yes, absolutely that is what we saw.", "Operator", "", "Our next question will come from Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Tony, did you indicate that the extra day added a percentage point to same store sales on the quarter?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "That\u2019s correct, 110 basis points.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Do you have a sense to what the EPS benefit was from that extra day?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "We could estimate but I would prefer to get back to you on it but, generally you would just extrapolate to the expense operating model.  ", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "$0.01 or $0.02 maybe?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Yes.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Remind me, is that just an extra day for the year or does that come out of the first quarter?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "That did come out of the first quarter.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Greg, on the reduction in the inventories, down 12% per store, what did you have a year ago that you don\u2019t have today?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Well, Tony mentioned it earlier in his remarks about the reduction in imports.  What we did I guess a year ago was we got a little too aggressive with some of the hard line categories and we pushed a lot of them in to inventory early on.  Of course, once you sit in a situation where you are overstocked, it takes you time to burn that off.  So, as we worked our way through that, we\u2019ve now right sized or deliveries and right sized inventories and that\u2019s why we\u2019re in much better shape.  We really didn\u2019t over buy, we bought more closer to need and we\u2019re managing things on a month-to-month basis.  We\u2019re really watching the spend and placing our dollars where we see the business that\u2019s open and developing and where it\u2019s not, we pull back.  We just have a much more disciplined approach now than we had in the past.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "I recognize the pressures of inflation on the LIFO but at the same time, with a 12% reduction in inventory, you must be digging in to some of the lower cost LIFO layers.  Is there actually some point where that would actually give you a LIFO contribution to earnings?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Currently we\u2019re not forecasting that.  That could be a potential but the way that we project the LIFO expense, we try to maintain a reasonable percentage throughout the entire year versus match it specifically to each quarter and the impact of that quarter.  So, several variables are impacted.  Clearly, what we forecast as increases in prices, what we forecast the inventory to be all come in to play as far as determining the LIFO impact.  But clearly, what I would say is that we feel that the current point in time that we have the proper reserves set up for LIFO and clearly dependent on the variables in the second half of the year will determine at what point in time additional charges or decrements need to occur. ", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "I was thinking just the opposite given that you\u2019re reading in to those lower LIFO layers.  I think the last question I had, Greg on the [pat suit] category, can you talk about what kind of inflation rate or what kind of pricing you\u2019re seeing per bag compared to a year ago?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "I can give you one example, I\u2019ll give you one on the birdseed category that we\u2019ve seen.  The cost have jumped about $7 or $8 per bag over a period of time. We made pricing adjustments but we didn\u2019t make the adjustment all at one time.  We were very cognoscente that could be shock to the consumer so we kind of stuffed it in on a month to every six week basis and finally brought it up to what we consider to be the new target at retail.  By doing that, we actually preserved our unit sales to a large degree and I think the consumer understood that there\u2019s inflationary pressures out there.  So, we didn\u2019t jolt them overnight, we really took a step-by-step approach and that\u2019s worked well for us.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital Markets.", "Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "I just wanted to clarify Dan\u2019s question for  a second, Tony are you  just saying that there will be no LIFO provision in third and fourth quarter, you\u2019ll measure it at the end of the fourth quarter and then determine it?  Then also for 09, given what you\u2019re seeing in inflations, you would think you\u2019d have some kind of credit or charge, not something that would be flat even throughout 09 given what you\u2019re seeing with prices increases.", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "No, what I\u2019m saying for the second half is it will be [inaudible] through the second half.  As we analyze a charge, we will have a ratable charge for LIFO.  Relative year-over-year, it may be less than the prior year.  Again, there are too many variables to estimate and we need to determine as we move through to the second half.  As we move in to next year, we have to make that assessment but again, we\u2019re always a judge \u2013 either very dependent on the yearend inventory balances and the thing that I think we are missing here is really taking a large, big enough, hard look at what we have set up.  Intuitively, you may be sitting back looking at certain product categories that may be inflationary but, depending on how our baskets are set up and how they offset each other, have a significant impact on the LIFO reserve. ", "Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "That leads to my next question I guess, out of the 3% comp that you had in that, looking at that basket, how much of it was drive by price increases versus unit?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Generally, we try not to get in to a detailed discussion about an inflation calculation because of its subjectivity.  When I look at inflation relative to the LIFO charge, there\u2019s clearly as much as you would like to say that there\u2019s a relationship there, there\u2019s really a disconnect because there are different variables that are involved in determining the LIFO charge versus your inflation charge.  Having said that, clearly the inflation impact had [inaudible], clearly we have been impacted from 1% to 1.5%.  I would say as its moved through this year, its more than double that impact and represents somewhere between the 3% and 4% impact on retail prices.", "Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Can we assume that kind of in to 09 as you\u2019re looking at the vendors coming through with price increase for 09, a similar kind of thing?", "James F. Wright ", "If you\u2019re a vendor, I would say certainly not.  The real question for us is and the wild card here is what happens to commodities and it looks like frankly we may have peaked or have some decline there.  Steel is the wild card and obviously we bought a lot of our steel product for Q2 on last year\u2019s base.  As we are now beginning to renegotiate for next year we are seeing obviously the impact of what has happened with steel pricing over the last, well really since April 10th I guess when it really spiked.  So, the answer to that is it really depends.  We negotiate the price of commodities on almost a week-to-week month-to-month basis.  We watch commodity prices, so do our vendors and steel we have to see what comes through as we begin negotiation for next spring\u2019s steel intensive categories.", "Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "", "My last question Jim I guess is for you.  You talked about 90 to 95 stores next year but if you add six to eight stores moving from 08 to 09 that would mean a step down I guess on the absolute numbers that we would have normally been opening.  I mean, is it your view now that maybe this is going to be a little bit longer term and that you don\u2019t mind, at least implicitly implied by this that you run with a lower rate or is there something more secular that you\u2019re thinking about here?", "James F. Wright ", "No, we\u2019re just being somewhat cautious.  I think 12% growth in today\u2019s retail market probably would not be in anyone\u2019s conservative scale, we feel it is.  We feel it is the right path to set more opening new stores with the market as we understand it.  If the market changes and building prices soften significantly in the markets we serve which has not happened here yet, we may choose to be opportunistic and accelerate beyond that 90 to 95 stores.  We\u2019ve also done a model where we\u2019ve looked at the four to five year impact of slowing growth to 12%, 10% and 8% and frankly, unless we have an extremely short term focus on earnings, there\u2019s a marginal benefit, a few pennies a share in year two three and then a significant drag on earnings year three and four to five forward.  So, by bringing it down just a little bit, to I guess around a 12% growth we feel we have reached the right balance of fuse to [inaudible] if there\u2019s an opportunity and of working our way through whatever consumer environment we may face in the next 12 to 36 months.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Jay McCanless \u2013 FTN Midwest Securities.", "Jay McCanless \u2013 FTN Midwest Securities", "A couple of questions, first I wanted to start on the inventory, I guess the best way to term it is sort of the clutter reduction benefit, is that coming to an end now?  I believe Greg you said earlier that you were comfortable now with store inventory levels accepting for the normal seasonal fluctuations?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Jay, that\u2019s only one piece where we\u2019re at.  Am I satisfied or do I think we\u2019re all the way through it?  The answer would be no.  I think there\u2019s other pieces I should mention, one is the new planogram line review process really helps us do a lot of SKU rationalization right up front as we go through and change assortments moving forward so that in itself is already in play, we\u2019re already starting to see the benefit of that.  I would also tell you that as we look at each category of business right now we\u2019re really trying to determine what is the absolute inventory level that we should operate at on a day-to-day basis.  As we have seasonal fluctuations as we peak seasons and drop off in seasons one of the challenges that Stan and I both have with our team here is to understand what is the appetite?  We like to do a lot more promoting from within our core assortments when we can and I\u2019ll be honest with you, we probably have more opportunity here than we\u2019ve taken advantage of and so there\u2019s a lot of learning and that continues to bring inventory down as we run some promotions an offer the consumer some great buys.  ", "We seem to blitz out of merchandise, I hate to say that but we\u2019re selling out and selling through faster and if you talk to some of our store folks they would say that we need to be buying deeper but, we just don\u2019t know right now with the new strategy cleaning those stores up and promoting from within and really rationalizing the SKU base, we\u2019re all learning, we\u2019re learning how high is high.", "Jay McCanless \u2013 FTN Midwest Securities", "That follows on to my second question which is with the amount of promotions that I got in my email this month and then also seeing it at the store levels, if you look at 2Q sales this year versus 2Q last year, what percentage would you say were full boat sales i.e. non-discounted?  And, how did that change versus last year?", "James F. Wright ", "Probably the best way to answer that question is that the merchandise margin line, we picked up 40 basis points while we cleared more old merchandise than in the prior year.  So, if you add up the promotional activity that we had, the relative pricing that we employed to hopefully drive some more transactions, bear in mind that our burn rate on old heavy inventory was higher than last year, frankly I\u2019m really pleased with the balance that we had and delighted with the fact that we ended up with a 40 basis point merchandise margin improvement.", "Jay McCanless \u2013 FTN Midwest Securities", "Then one more question if I could, with recent layoffs, etc. making the headlines, what are the trends that you\u2019re seeing now for store level payrolls and store level hourly rates?  Are you all able to pick up some of these people who are being laid off, etc. maybe pick up some more experienced folks at a cheaper rate?  How should we be thinking about that going forward?", "Stanley L. Ruta ", "We haven\u2019t seen anything significant in the markets we serve in either at the hourly level or at the manager trainee level.  It\u2019s been pretty much the same.", "Operator", "", "There are no further questions.  Please continue with any closing comments.", "James F. Wright ", "", "Thank you very much for being on board with us.  We again, are extremely confident about the future.  I\u2019m personally very proud of the team and their ability to anticipate, execute very well, serve our customers during these times.  Remind everyone that we have a very unique position in the marketplace.  We serve rural America, we serve those who live the lifestyle and we truly are the category killer in providing the non-discretionary and basic needs to the growing number of people who live in that wonderful place we call out here.

The information contained in this call is accurate only as of the date discussed.  Investors should not assume that the statements will remain operative at a later time.  Lastly, Tractor Supply Company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed in this call.", "Now I\u2019m pleased to introduce Jim Wright, Chairman, President, and CEO.  Jim, please go ahead.", "James F. Wright", "Thank you, Cara, and good afternoon everyone.  I\u2019m here today with Tony Crudele, our Chief Financial Officer, Stan Ruta, EVP of stores, and Greg Sandfort, EVP of Merchandising.  I am very pleased that through our team\u2019s hard work we delivered an exceptionally strong quarter.  We\u2019ve been able to navigate the headwinds as consumer sentiment continued to weaken throughout the year and we\u2019ve leveraged our leadership position in rural markets by taking advantage of key sign opportunities to serve our customers.  ", "Let me briefly review a few of the highlights and Tony will go into more detail in his section.  First our team has remained focused on consistent execution of our key initiatives to both grow and to improve our business.  We continue to make progress on our store expansion, on our inventory management, and merchandising programs.  Our aggressive expense control management program has continued to gain traction as we\u2019ve positioned Tractor Supply Company to operate as a leaner organization.  As a result of our solid efforts and the overall resiliency of our business model, we grew total sales by 16.6%, comps by 6.2%, and earnings per share by 20.5%.  ", "Second, during the quarter we experienced a significant contribution from core consumables and certain seasonal product categories.  We continued to derive repeat traffic and average ticket increases through our compelling merchandise assortment.", "Our core consumable category, such as animal and pet-related products, continued to perform well.  Emergency preparation and response items such as generators and pumps were driven by demand created from the impact of Hurricane Ike.  As many of you know, in the third quarter we are also focused on preparing our stores for the important fall and winter and holiday seasons.  We are pleased that other seasonal products such as our home heating units and wood pellet fuel experienced strong demand earlier in the season than usual.  ", "Our stores are well prepared to support this increase of initial demand.  Finally, we continue to improve working capital management by managing our inventory levels efficiently and by achieving strong earnings growth.  We\u2019ve been able to deliver significant cash f low from operations.  Cash flow from operations increased nearly $88 million to $143.6 million for the nine months of 2008 versus the same first three quarters of 2007.  This has provided us with ample liquidity to fund both our store growth and share repurchase programs while reducing our debt by $65 million.", "As a result of our leadership\u2019s anticipation and response to headwinds, we\u2019ve continued to grow our business at a time when many other retailers have not.  However, it\u2019s important to note that we are not immune from macroeconomic trends.  While the soft housing market has had less impact on our customers and our company than most, we recognize that this, along with the increasingly challenging economy, are contributing factors to the overall weakening consumer sentiment.  Therefore we believe it is imperative that we remain diligent and focused on what has made our company successful. ", "All of our actions this year have been consistent with our strategic vision for the company.  We believe that the solid financial and operational foundation we have in place will allow us to successfully navigate the current challenges while concurrently positioning the company for the future.  I will discuss how we are preparing for the winter and holiday seasons along with our financial long term growth drivers later in the call.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tony to review our financial performance during the quarter and to discuss our full year outlook.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Good afternoon, everyone.  During the quarter we were extremely pleased with both our top line results and expense control.  Our sales performance provided us the ability to effectively manage gross margin and control inventory levels.  For the third quarter ended September 27, 2008, sales increased 6.6% to $733.9 million compared to last year\u2019s third quarter.  Net income was $19.8 million or $0.53 per diluted share compared to $17.5 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the same period last year.  ", "Total comp sales for the period increased 6.2% and non-comp sales were approximately $63.8 million or 8.7% of sales.   Going into greater detail about sales in the quarter, our core consumable business remained an outstanding performer in the third quarter.  Our customers also responded extremely well to our pre-season heating assortment.  We believe they wanted to ensure they secured wood heating stoves, furnaces, and pellets as an alternative energy source.  It\u2019s important to note that based on our analysis of year-over-year heating sales trends, we believe a large portion of the advanced purchases we saw in Q3 normally would have occurred in Q4. ", "Total comp sales benefited from an increase in emergency response sales as a result of the landfall hurricanes in Louisiana and Texas.  Although we lost some selling days from store closures, we had an overall sales increase.  We estimate the hurricanes benefited comp sales by approximately 100 to 150 basis points and EPS was approximately $0.03.  We increased average comp transactions by approximately 90 basis points.  An average ticket increased 5.2%.  We believe this was primarily as a result of increased retail prices related to commodity cost increase.", "Consumers continue to be cautious with their spending on discretionary and big ticket items except where it was a particulars need or they perceived a compelling value.  For example, categories that performed well included alternative heating stoves, chainsaws, and welders.  Also of note is that the gap between our housing related categories and chainwide comps has narrowed as we are stifling some of the steep declines of last year.  We had positive comp sales in each month of the quarter.  While July was the strongest month, September was also positively impacted by the emergency response and pre-season heating sales.", "Other than the hurricane activity, weather did not play a significant factor on a year-over-year comparable basis.  Generally moisture levels across the country improved year-over-year with fewer regions experiencing drought conditions this year.  With respect to the regional sales trends, comp sales were the strongest in the northern states and weakest in the southeast, which was impacted by both dry conditions and slowness of the Florida economy.", "Comp sales in our Dell stores were below the company average as they were cycling double digit comps in the prior year.  Additionally significantly higher hay prices had a negative impact on the consumer in the quarter.  ", "Turning now to gross margin, we experienced a decline of approximately 97 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.  This decline resulted principally from an increase in freight expense, an increase in the LIFO reserve, and an aggressive markdown program.  First let me review a few items that negatively impacted gross margin.  Freight expense increased by 39 basis points as a result of increased fuel costs and to a lesser extent a mix of the goods that carried higher than chain average freight costs.  ", "Our LIFO allowance increased by 24 basis points over the prior year driven by escalating grain, oil, and steel costs this year.  Although we have received some relief in the recent weeks from the various categories of inflation, our year end estimates continue to run much higher than previous year.  Although we continue to improve our per store inventory levels, we continue to have charges for certain of our LIFO pools because of increasing moving average costs and our overall company inventory increasing as you would expect from a growing company.", "We had a strong emergency response merchandise sale that negatively impacted the margin mix as it generally carries a lower than chain average margin.  Additionally, we continue to be aggressive with the markdowns for seasonal product and certain non-go-forward inventory to keep the inventory fresh.  All of these were partially offset by product margins which improved principally from better buying, retail price increases, and improved inventory turnover.  ", "Import purchases as a percentage of purchases in the quarter increased 10 basis points from the prior year.  Although we have not seen our import purchases increase significantly as a percent of purchases this year as we have stringently managed our inventories.  We have seen our sales from import goods increase almost 40 basis points and now represent about 6.6% of our sales.  For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization as a percent of sales was 26.2%, a decrease of approximately 70 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year.  Sales productivity clearly benefited the leverage in the quarter.  While we continue to experience higher occupancy costs from our store expansion program, it is beginning to moderate and the expense was offset by other SG&A categories that we did leverage.", "In the third quarter we opened 20 stores compared to 21 store openings last year.  The opening expenses were approximately $2.1 million compared to $2.4 million in the prior year quarter.  Our cost containment initiative continues to be very effective as we focused on reducing non-essential costs while managing through the tough economic environment.  For example, at our summer store managers sales meeting, we considerably reduced the number of attendees and had one less hotel night stay.  This saved approximately $500,000 in the third quarter.  ", "Turning to the balance sheet.  First we continued to make great strides on inventory management.  This marks the fourth consecutive quarter that inventories on a per-store basis have decreased.  At quarter end, inventory levels per store were down approximately 8.5% compared to the prior year.  Our calculation is based on average cost of inventory and excludes in transit inventory and inventory held in unopened stores.", "As we head into Q4, we are pleased with our inventory position and we anticipate that we can continue to drive down inventory per store albeit at a lesser magnitude.  Inventory turns have improved nearly 20 basis points to 2.75 on an annualized year-to-date basis.  This resulted principally from better inventory management.  We believe our improved inventory management will continue through the remainder of the year and we are well positioned to exceed our target for improving annual turns by 15 basis points.", "We also improved accounts payable financing of inventory from approximately 38.7% up to 48.4% resulting principally from better accounts payable management and vendor dating.  The management team continues to make progress on this initiative that we commenced last year and it\u2019s received momentum from the accelerated inventory turns.  ", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $15.4 million.  As anticipated, the majority of the spend relates to our new store opening program. Year-to-date CapEx totals $68.8 million which includes $8.5 million for the acquisition of two store properties in the first quarter.  No properties were acquired in the third quarter.  For the first nine months of last year, 2007, CapEx totaled $68.4 million.", "During the third quarter we continued to make purchases under out stock repurchase program.  Specifically, we bought approximately 465,000 shares for $14.7 million for a cumulative of 192.5 million since the inception of the program in February 2007.  The share repurchase program had a favorable impact on EPS for the quarter of approximately $0.01.  Subject to prevailing market conditions, we expect to continue to make additional purchases as part of our long term objective at reducing our cost of capital.  ", "However, generally when there is significant volatility in the equity markets, it will temper our purchasing activity.  As Jim mentioned, we continue to make great strides in generating strong cash flow by managing our working capital position.  We anticipate that our peak borrowings which generally occur in February and October time frames will not exceed $100 million in the fourth quarter.  This is a substantial decrease from the prior year and we are committed to continuing to manage our capital structure prudently.", "As many of you are aware, we exercised our option to expand our revolving credit facility by $100 million earlier in the year.  We are very comfortable with our liquidity position as this facility is $350 million and does not expire until 2012.  Our bank group is solid, led by Bank of America.  ", "Turning to our outlook for the full year.  With respect to our financial expectations for the full year 2008, as noted in today\u2019s press release we have confirmed our previous expectations for sales, comp sales, and earnings per share.  We expect full year sales to range between $2.98 billion to $3.03 billion with full year comp sales ranging between flat and up 2% and earnings per share to range between $2.49 and $2.55.  ", "Let me discuss a few of the assumptions underlining these estimates.  First, we have balanced our full year guidance based on a combination of current economic trends and our performance for the year-to-date.  As we look forward to the fall holiday season, we have taken a very cautious perspective that we believe is appropriate.  The retail environment is clearly uncertain with consumer confidence at a low and current consumer environment and economic forecasts are for weak holiday spending.  ", "At the same time, our customers have responded favorably over the past quarter.  As evidenced by our results, we have seen over the course of this year that our business has been quite resilient during a very difficult economic period.  The consumer continues to shop our stores for a wide variety of functional and non-discretionary items that are very relevant to their lifestyle.  These trends have continued into October although it should be noted that we are facing relatively easy comp sales for October.  ", "Additionally we have a very solid fall and holiday program and Jim will provide more color on that shortly.  From a weather perspective, as most of you are aware, harsh cold winters generally will have a positive impact on sales when our insulated work wear, heating products, snow removal, and emergency response equipment are essential. In the fourth quarter we anticipate that the weather will have a neutral to negative impact as it will be difficult to cycle some of the colder November weather we experienced in 2007 based on the current weather forecasts.", "We are planning for lower gross margins for the fourth quarter versus the prior year given the expected fuel costs, our current merchandise mix, and our ongoing inventory management initiatives.  Our fourth quarter estimates for fuel cost are based on current price levels which are still slightly higher than the fourth quarter last year.  At the same time we anticipate we will continue to leverage SG&A slightly on a reasonable sales base because we have been very successful this year in aggressively managing our operating expenses.  ", "We have continued to manage discretionary projects more tightly throughout the year and now anticipate CapEx spending to be closer to $90 million which is approximately $5 million below the guidance we provided on the last quarter conference call.  Related to our store expansion program, we expect to open 21 stores in the fourth quarter and finish 2008 with approximately 91 new stores.  We will relocate one store in the fourth quarter.", "A quick comment on 2009 expansion.  As we have previously stated on our second quarter conference call, we had anticipated holding our store growth constant around 90 stores.  Although we have a good portion of the new stores for 2009 already under lease, we will review our proposed sites very critically to ensure proper capital allocation as we maintain our disciplined capital spending program and Jim will discuss this in greater detail momentarily.", "In addition we are cognizant that some of the real estate partners are very likely to have financing limitations in 2009 due to the tightening credit markets.  In the event third party projects are eliminated or pushed to a later period, we would not seek to replace those deals in our new store pipeline for the year.  Therefore we anticipate it as more probable that we will open 70 to 80 stores in 2009.", "In closing, as you may sense from our comments, we are very pleased with our performance over the last two quarters in a very difficult retail environment.  We have proven that we can execute our strategies and react when the situation dictates.  We believe our ability to execute and serve the functional needs of the Out Here customer will be the key differentiators as we manage through the fourth quarter.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Jim.", "James F. Wright", "Thanks, Tony.  Our performance throughout this year has been the result of our team\u2019s steadfast execution and our passion to serve those customers living the rural lifestyle, combined with our ability to rapidly analyze and adapt our plans to an ever-changing marketplace.  ", "I\u2019d like to spend a moment today discussing some of the actions we\u2019re taking to navigate the current environment as we head into the important winter and holiday selling period.  Clearly consumers have been heavily impacted by the economic turmoil the last few months and all of the headlines point to this being one of the most difficult seasons in many years.  Our store and store support center teams continue to fine tune our strategies for the season by analyzing the most recent consumer spending behaviors.  We know it\u2019s essential for us to be responsive not only to yesterday\u2019s sales data but even more importantly to be proactive and anticipate where the consumer trends are going.  To that end, we must remain nimble and forward-looking.", "Entering the season, we focused our merchandise assortment of items that are very relevant to our customers\u2019 basic lifestyle needs.  Our gift assortment for this season is focused on key basics and compelling values.  Much of our gift assortment this year is basic in-line merchandise allowing us to limit markdown or carry over risk.  We\u2019ve also focused on offering a range of gift items at mid and lower price levels and we expect that this will be well received by our customers.", "We maintain record in stock levels at this point in time and continue through the fourth quarter but while we will be able to continue reducing our overall inventory levels per store as part of our efforts to enhance working capital.  We\u2019ll complement our merchandising strategies with advertising that features core consumables and compelling gifts to drive customer traffic and we believe we\u2019re well-positioned to effectively capture share of wallet. ", "All that said, our stores are in great shape.  We\u2019re continuing to monitor our customer\u2019s spend behaviors closely and we are positioned to execute and to serve the unique needs of those living out here.  At the same time we are not easing up on the aggressive expense management program that we initiated earlier in the year.  We are operating today as a lean and efficient organization.  We are rapidly approaching the end of the year and continue to look ahead.  We remain committed to being a growth company.", "Let me discuss a few of the fundamental long term drivers of our business that we expect will allow us to maximize our potential in 2009 and beyond.  First is our store expansion.  As Tony mentioned, we are being somewhat cautious with our near term growth plans given the uncertainty of 2009. We believe we are striking the right balance between positioning ourselves to seize potential opportunities and working through the current economic conditions.  We anticipate opening around 91 stores this year and approximately 70 to 80 stores in 2009.  However, we believe our long term target of 13% store growth will continue to be appropriate in a more normalized environment.", "Again we strongly believe there is a significant long term opportunity to expand our store base overall.  We have identified 1400 market opportunities and we believe that number will prove conservative over time.  We\u2019ve developed the right systems and processes that will allow us to operate as a much larger national team without losing our home town look and feel.  We\u2019ve also invested in our people from the store support center to the store level to ensure that we meet and exceed our customers\u2019 expectations.  Based on our performance on our new stores we will continue to ramp up as planned.  We see significant evidence that our model is working.  ", "Second, we\u2019ll also grow through our mix of relevant products.  Simply put, we are winning in both thriving and challenging economic cycles by staying true to who we are, a specialty retailer that understands the unique needs of those living the rural lifestyle.  We know that our every day basic items combined with informed service will keep our customers returning to our stores even in the most difficult cycles.  Our customers are committed to the rural lifestyle and that rural lifestyle continues to be aspirational.  Those consumers have a lower cost of living and as a result they have stronger discretionary income and are less reliant on credit than the national average.  They own smaller homes and they have smaller mortgages.  ", "Most importantly, our consumers always have basic needs that support their chosen lifestyle.  They need to feed their pets, contain their large animals, use chain saws to cut the firewood that heats their home.  As we\u2019ve stated in the past, we believe there are areas where we can expand our gross margin.  For example, we continue to focus on strategic direct sourcing and increase our private label sales.  Over the long term we target 13% of our sales from strategic sourcing and 25% of our sales for private label products.  We also continue to gain margins through price optimization initiatives.  ", "Third, we also have opportunities to improve the productivity of our inventory and supply chain.  We have improved our inventory levels this year through more disciplined purchasing and by executing a strategic markdown program.  We believe there are additional opportunities to increase the efficiencies in our supply chain by applying lean principles which we call Tractor Value System or TVS.  We\u2019ve also recently added 250,000 square feet to our distribution center in Waco Texas and our distribution network currently has adequate capacity to support our growth plans for the next three years.  ", "Finally, our solid financial foundation provides us with the ability to maximize shareholder value while allowing us to maintain a firm commitment to investing in long term growth initiatives.  We are very pleased to say we are in excellent standing with our lenders.  We remain very well positioned financially for both near and long term.  We continue to effectively manage our capital structure as evidenced by the strength of our balance sheet which carries no maturing debt until 2012.  ", "To that end, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank our entire team for their hard work.  Our team members are critical in responding to our customers\u2019 needs and they\u2019re doing an outstanding job.  I\u2019m proud of our team\u2019s execution and I\u2019d especially like to thank those associates in hurricane affected areas who stepped up and did whatever it took.", "This concludes our prepared remarks.  Operator, we\u2019d now like to open the call for questions.  ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", " ", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Cumberland from Robert Baird.", "David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "On the plan to open 70 or 80 stores in \u201909 instead of 90, all else equal, would that have a slight benefit to \u201909 EPS versus opening 90 due to lower opening expenses?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes, it should just have a slight benefit.  We will obviously make that up in some of the pre-opening expenses.  Generally since we have targeted a majority of these stores we\u2019ll maybe front load it this year and obviously the longer the store is open, the better they will perform throughout the year, so it should have a slight benefit.", "David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Then in home heating, in the typical Q3, what percentage of the cold weather seasons sales of home heating are in that typical Q3 and then maybe what increase percentage did you see in this just past Q3?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "A little bit more difficult to answer and only because the analysis winds up being very subjective based on the trends that we saw. We tried to benchmark versus last year and tried to look at the seasonal pattern and then again since there\u2019s a lot of different assumptions that we use to try to track it, I\u2019d rather not get into the specific details. We did see a significant trend of sales in the third quarter that generally we have not seen in the past and that ramp was a lot quicker and earlier in the third quarter which generally drives us to believe that some of those sales were pulled forward into the September and late August time frames.  Other than that we can\u2019t give you too much more detail.", "David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Can you comment on whether you see enough fall off in that category in early Q4?", "James F. Wright", "Generally our overall comment is that through October we have had generally the same trends as we\u2019ve seen in September.", "David Cumberland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Then my last question, is historically on stores that have benefited from storm activity and sales of disaster relief items, what type of follow on business or increase in traffic in the customer base like those stores have seen in later periods?", "James F. Wright", "We\u2019ve seen a bit of a step function in comp trend and average volume per week and David, it sticks with us.  We believe it\u2019s principally the fact that customers previously not aware of shopping Tractor Supply are exposed not only to the service but to the assortment that the store holds, but it\u2019s certainly not a double digit kind of a number.  Historically it\u2019s a mid single kind of a step function for the stores that are most significantly involved and then that goes... the further out the less more evolved they were with hurricane response, the less significant that function becomes.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Lawrence from Morgan Keegan.", "John Lawrence - Morgan Keegan", "Jim, would you start off by talking just a little bit about private label for holiday, how much is inventory up for both Schmidt and for Red Shed going into the holiday?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "John, I\u2019ll answer that.  Red Shed is actually slightly down.  We had some earnings from last year and we have tuned up those assortments, I\u2019ll use that terminology, so it\u2019s slightly down, but Schmidt is up double digit.  Schmidt continues to perform.  It\u2019s a terrific alternative to the brands that sit above it.  It continues to sell across the board in every category that we have it places, so you\u2019ll see an increase there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "Analyst for David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Hi this is Chris.  First question is just with your clearance activity and third quarter.  Can you say whether that was generally on plan?  You mentioned some seasonal items that drove that activity and I was just wondering if there were any particular categories that were maybe weaker than you expected. ", "James F. Wright", "For the most part it was a little accelerated from a historic level of clearance activities.  There were several test initiatives, most significantly those involved in our My Garage initiative, also the Master Hand tool brand.  While we had some successful learning in My Garage and we were able to take a few lines and some SKUs and merchandise chainwide, on the overall, I guess it was a failed concept and we are moving and have already moved some of that merchandise out of the store through markdown processes.  Additionally we also chose to launch the Master Hand brand of private branded power tools and hand tools a little over a year ago, actually coming up on two years, and we\u2019ve determined that we pretty much overshot the price value proposition that our customers would be attracted to, so we built too much into the product and we are now again moving through that product.", "Beyond that, it was perhaps a normalized environment with a little more rigor placed around the slowest selling product and a little more rigor around the regionality of inventory.  ", "Analyst for David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay, and then secondly, can you describe what sort of advertising venues you\u2019re focused on for the holiday period?", "James F. Wright", "", "We will see an equal number of print events as with last year with a more compelling assortment of both product and price point.  We will shift some TV spending to our CRM effort and ultimately through direct mail as we continue to gain expertise with CRM and continue to increase the number of attributed sales.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jack Murphy from William Blair.", "Jack Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company", "First, if you look at the comps excluding the hurricane in September in particular, was the traffic and ticket roughly similar to the first couple of months and can you just talk about the trend line across the three months for consumables in particular?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Generally we saw throughout the quarter that it was fairly consistent from both the consumables and from a traffic standpoint.  As I mentioned in my points, comps were a little bit stronger in July, and September\u2019s strength was driven by the hurricanes, but throughout the quarter we felt that the trend was relatively consistent for both traffic and consumables. ", "Jack Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company", "I\u2019d just like to follow up on the real estate question from earlier and the comments you made.  You talked about rationing down to 70 or 80 stores because of financing with developers and the like.  But given the fact that real estate for retail is likely to continue to soften, it\u2019s already softening a lot, would you consider being opportunistic as you move throughout the year and that sites are kind of coming up, these second use sites are coming up that you would consider getting to 13% for \u201909?", "James F. Wright", "The overall kind of macro retail real estate trends are not impacting our markets or our size boxes nearly to the level that you might imagine.  The further from the mall, the further from the urban/suburban areas you get, the less of a trend that is.  Frankly, Wal-Mart\u2019s slowing growth is also ultimately... will dry up a little bit of the pipeline for us as we fairly frequently will use the garden shop end of a Wal-Mart when they move to a super center, so thus far we have not seen a significant change in cost or increase in availability.  Obviously with our balance sheet we... and our pipeline of capable store manager trainees, we have some dry powder should that situation change. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Peter Benedict from Wachovia.", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Just a couple things.  First of all on the fourth quarter, it sounds like the range that\u2019s implied for comps is pretty wide but it sounds like from your comments that at least so far you\u2019re running up in that low to mid single digit range, but you\u2019re saying that October is the easiest comparison?  I just wanted to clarify that.", "James F. Wright", "October is the easiest, November is the toughest.  At this point in time it looks like the model\u2019s working, customers are responding, obviously when the news was the darkest they changed behavior for two or three days but they have subsequently returned to the stores.  ", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets", "On the inflation front, Tony, maybe you can talk a little bit about how much inflation is impacting the comp.  You kind of mentioned it last quarter.  Is it getting stronger?  And when did you first start to see it?  As we look to \u201909, when do we start to anniversary the real lift of comps that came from price inflation?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "It clearly has been staggered throughout the year and we\u2019ve seen it ramp each quarter.  We definitely in the third quarter are running above what we saw in the second quarter and I think as we continue to have our moving average cost ramp up we will continue to see that retail move along with it.  We do expect to have some relief and we\u2019ve seen some relief over the past few weeks on some of the commodity price increases.  It will be some time before that translates through our moving average cost and/or the vendors translate that back into lower prices.  I would anticipate starting to anniversary more at the end of the first quarter next year.  That\u2019s when we started to see it more significantly impact the retail prices.", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Okay, that\u2019s fair, then as you think about SG&A next year, what type of comp you\u2019d need to kind of leverage that number.  I know the occupancy trends are supposed to get a lot better next year.  Can you just talk about how we should be thinking about that?", "James F. Wright", "Generally in the past we\u2019ve said about 4.5 is the comp number we\u2019d like to leverage with our expense control this year and the sustainability of that program through next year.  I would anticipate that we are closer to 4, potentially 3.5, I don\u2019t want to get overly aggressive or ahead of ourselves but I would say somewhere in that range we can achieve leverage.  Depending on the quarter.  First quarter will always be very difficult for us to leverage since it\u2019s such a light sales quarter.", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets", "You said that you do expect to leverage SG&A in the fourth quarter, is that right?", "James F. Wright", "Yes slightly.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Jim, did you not get the memo we\u2019re in a recession? ", "James F. Wright", "Were you at the manager\u2019s meeting when I told them we would not participate? They believed me, and they\u2019re doing a terrific job.  I think frankly we anticipated early, we reacted early, laid our plans.  We\u2019re also fortunate in that I really believe and we have data to support this that our customers have lived in their houses for a long time, they are truly smaller houses, their mortgages are smaller and more mature and our customers\u2019 credit are debt-conservative.  We are well-positioned.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Question I had, maybe as far as Greg, question relating to the clearance activity.  I was a bit surprised given you entered the third quarter with lean inventories.  Obviously sales were strong during the period as well.  If you could just give a little clarification as to why the clearance would have increased year-over-year.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Well a couple of reasons.  The main is, and what Jim referred to in the My Garage category.  We made a decision that we had learned enough from the test.  It was time to move on problem merchandise, so that\u2019s the primary reason, that is the primary driver.  We also to be honest put in some new tracking and planning tools to ensure that we would sell clean through the third and fourth quarter on seasonal and we\u2019ve identified early on some things that weren\u2019t working to our satisfaction so we acted on those as well.  It\u2019s quite simple actually, it\u2019s a combination of several things, but it\u2019s just really us addressing an issue and also staying on top of the business.  ", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Is that a... the idea of taking the markdowns earlier, is that something we would likely see for the next two or three quarters?", "James F. Wright", "That\u2019s part of our forward planning, yes.  In the seasonal categories, absolutely.  We want to sell cleaner. We believe that there\u2019s an opportunity for us to transition a little faster than we have been but again it\u2019s part of what we already projected and forecasted for.", "", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Tony, you had alluded to diesel price still higher year-over-year as one of the reasons why margin could be lowered in 4Q but is that still true given what\u2019s happened in the last 7 to 10 days or are you expecting a bit of a rebound with the idea of that diesel cost will be higher?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "We did our projection within the last week and we used the current diesel price at that point in time.  Generally not forecasting up or down, just using the current trend.", "", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Just two other real quick questions.  One, what is the rate of inflation in pet food and then the other also related to merchandising, apparel.  Most other soft line retailers are struggling.  I know this is a category you\u2019ve added space in the last couple of years.  How would you evaluate your performance in soft lines?", "James F. Wright", "We won\u2019t speak specifically to inflation in pet food.  We do believe it\u2019s going to moderate as inputs come down and with regard to apparel side of the business, we never claimed that we sold anything that was fashionable and I\u2019m really glad we are not.  We sell basic functional work wear and frankly quarter by quarter are getting better at planning an allocation by size, by climatic zone, and I think we\u2019re really extremely well positioned right now.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Shawn DeSoro] from Black Rock.", "[Shawn DeSoro] \u2013 Black Rock", "Just a couple quick questions and I apologize if I missed it.  Did you quantify the basis point drag from the clearance activity in the quarter?", "James F. Wright", "No we did not.  When we look at that activity, a lot of it either blended into the initial margin, some of it identified up front as a longer term potential markdown so we did not quantify it.", "[Shawn DeSoro] \u2013 Black Rock", "And then in terms of inventory per store, where can we go over time, over a couple year period.  Is it possible that this gets into the low eights or maybe even 800 a store is that probably something too much to ask for?", "James F. Wright", "I think we\u2019ll continue for another probably 3 or 4 quarters to see some incremental gain over time.  We\u2019ll see turnover, inventory efficiency continue to increase but frankly we\u2019re excited about the fact that we have some successful test programs that we\u2019ll begin investing in to further drive top line.  So when we look at absolute dollars per store I would think that we are near the bottom of that curve.  Again, continue to see some gain for a while but then we will begin to re-invest and drive the top line as our tests gains traction. ", "[Shawn DeSoro] \u2013 Black Rock", "So we\u2019ll see probably more in the turn column going forward. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Stephen Chick of FBR.", "Stephen Chick - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "I guess first off maybe for Tony, the aggressive expense management program, can you.. Is there a way you could maybe assign some type of number on how much that\u2019s saving SG&A dollars, and I know you gave the example of the lower attendance, I think you said at a meeting in one less day, is it really just a lot of little things like that, or is there other things you can point to that\u2019s helping with expenses?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Generally it is a lot of little things.  I would say the largest function is really at the store level in our payroll management and we just had much tighter control in that area and obviously it\u2019s one of the larger expense line items outside of the occupancy in SG&A so a good portion of the expense control I would attribute to that, however, on sort of more the traditional G&A side of the SG&A.  It\u2019s been really just a lot of little things.", "Stephen Chick - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "So if you leveraged SG&A I think you said 70 basis points in the quarter, is there a way to assign kind of a basis point benefit to these little things in total, like what part of 70 basis points would you say came from this aggressive push on expenses?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "It would be difficult to quantify but I would identify that relative to our original forecast at the beginning of the year, it makes up a substantial portion of the benefit that we derived as we moved across the year.", "Stephen Chick - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "And can you remind me, I apologize, did the initiative to that start at the beginning of the second quarter, is that correct?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Basically in the middle to last month of the first quarter.", "Stephen Chick - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "And then second, if I could, really just to clarify on your comp store sales guidance that the flat to positive 2% for the year, what does that kind of imply what you\u2019re looking for for the fourth quarter?  I\u2019m coming up with that mathematically implies something that would be I think like flattish as a reported number in the fourth quarter.  I don\u2019t know if my math is correct or not.  ", "James F. Wright", "Generally when we looked at it, it is a fairly wide range.  What we\u2019re implying is that we believe that if you looked at the entire year, we\u2019re tracking relatively consistent with the initial guidance and would expect to continue to track at slightly lower than what we\u2019ve seen over the past two quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mitch Kaiser from Piper Jaffray.", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray", "Two quick questions for you, I guess both for Tony.  Just as it relates to the LIFO charge that we\u2019ve seen pop up here in the last two quarters, so it\u2019s a 42 basis point drag in Q2 and then 24 in Q3.  Did you quantify what your expectations might be as of today?  How might it impact Q4?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "We did not identify that in the forecast.  Obviously it\u2019s blended into my guidance when it comes to margin and again the freight component and the LIFO are the two largest.  As far as the drag on gross margin in the fourth quarter did not specify the percentage on either one of those components. We do expect that LIFO will moderate slightly over what we\u2019ve seen during the past two quarters.  ", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray", "I think in past quarters you were using a full year share count of 38.5 million which was excluding new share repurchases.  Is that still the full year share count that you\u2019re using in your guidance?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "No, we update that share guidance as to what the actual was at the end of a particular quarter.  Obviously at the end of this third quarter.  We do not assume any share repurchases go forward in our estimate.", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray", "So you\u2019re at 37.1 basically going forward through the rest of the year?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Correct.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joan Storms from Wedbush.", "Joan Storms - Wedbush Morgan", "This is a question probably for Greg.  Now that I think you first started probably halfway through the fourth quarter last year and what your take is on Jim had a very good discussion on the holiday inventory assortment and how you\u2019ve planned that as far as seasonal goods since that [inaudible] to be weak and what are maybe some inputs that you had on the thought process there?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Joan, I started last year the first of November so I was here a little bit more than halfway through the fourth and let me give you a little quick recap on what I think we\u2019ve done.  First of all from a planning standpoint and from a delivery standpoint we\u2019ve done a far better job this year flowing product through the stores.  We\u2019ve still got room for improvement but I felt much more comfortable this year than last year with the flow.  The second thing is on our allocation side of the business which is critical and in any seasonal business.  The read and react strategy in seasonal is where you win. You lose when you allocate too much of that product up front so we have been reeling that backward a little bit and saying, \u201cListen, how much of this can we hold and not allocate it till we start seeing some forward sales?\u201d ", "We\u2019ve done a number of things to assist ourselves this year with that process and that makes us also feel very strong about what we think our sell through rates will be and how we\u2019ll come out of the fourth quarter.  So the biggest risk for us is always the heavyweight outerwear and whether or not we\u2019ll get that ferocious winter that we need from say the upper midwest through the northeast.  Everything that we\u2019ve seen so far from [Aplatalytics] who we\u2019ve used to forecast some of this tells just what weather will continue so we\u2019re feeling very good about it.  The last thing would be the gift assortment.  Jim touched on earlier but we really mind our own current basic assortment products and said one of the things that our consumers will buy, we know that the economy is tightening, so how can we take those products and highlight those in the stores the fourth quarter, pass on some advantageous pricing and really drive those as gifts, and if you\u2019ll be in our stores in the fourth quarter, you\u2019ll see that, you\u2019ll note that, we have those called out, and we feel very, very good now given the economic conditions where we\u2019re positioned.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Kind of a follow up to that answer.  Can you give us the relative sales mix in the fourth quarter that is apparel and seasonal?  I now you gave us on an annual basis but could you give us a sense of the index to the annual number or the actual number for apparel and seasonal?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "We don\u2019t\u2019 have that number for you right now and we can have Randy circle back with you on that.  Obviously overall for the year is 9%, I would estimate that it\u2019s probably in the 12% range but I would rather wait until Randy gives you an exact number.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Does seasonal index higher too because of gift giving or is that just really... It\u2019s so high in the second quarter that we shouldn\u2019t think of it that way?", "James F. Wright", "Seasonal is definitely highest in second quarter followed by fourth but fourth is only marginally higher than third.  ", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Also in reference to the last answer, my follow up is Jim, in the press release you talked about specific steps you\u2019re taking and maybe I didn\u2019t listen well but it sounded like in your discussion up until this last answer we didn\u2019t quite hear that, but should we look at it as essentially you got a windfall if you will from the hurricanes in that business, yet you didn\u2019t raise your guidance, and as we look at your plan, not your relative conservatism and obviously that\u2019s prudent in this economy, just as we look at your plan, did you basically look at what\u2019s going on and say, \u201cWe have to get a little more promotional vis a vi our customers in various ways\u201d, is that essentially the plan side of it?", "James F. Wright", "I would say that on a year-over-year basis, we will be more promotional but we are not going to be what I would classify as promotional as I suspect some other retailers might become.  We have principally benefited over the years as we\u2019ve evolved into an every day competitive price value price strategy with occasional sales.  We have 15 print events a year and print plus the direct mail we\u2019re doing now are the only ways that we communicate an off price.  So we are not increasing the frequency of print.  We are marginally increasing the promotional flavor to our ads, but that has as much to do with the type of products, the consumables and lower price point products than it does with dropping the price of those products, if that answers your question.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Yes it does.", "Operator", "We have reached the allotted time for questions.  I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.", "", "James F. Wright", "Thank you all very much.  I\u2019m glad you\u2019re with us on this trip.  I\u2019m extremely proud of every member of the 1400 team here at Tractor Supply.  We asked them to do different things starting in mid Q1.  We asked them to do things differently and they at every level have done that.  I would remind you that the performance this quarter, I guess the last two quarters, and frankly year-to-date are a testament to the fact that we have a unique customer.  We serve a unique and I think more viable somewhat economic isolated market, and we have a model of resilience in the cycle that we are going through.  Again, thank you for being along on the trip and we remain a growth company.  Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time.  (Operator Instructions)", "Please be advised that reproduction of this call in whole or in part is not permitted without prior written authorization of the Tractor Supply Company.  As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Erica Pettit.", "Erica Pettit", "Thank you, Operator.

Lastly, Tractor Supply Company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed in this call.", "Now I am pleased to introduce Jim Wright, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer.", "James F. Wright", "Thank you, Erica, and good afternoon, everyone.  I\u2019m here today with Tony Crudele, our Chief Financial Officer, Stan Ruta, EVP of Stores, and Greg Sandfort, EVP of Merchandising.", "Before our review of our performance during 2008, I\u2019ll discuss the fourth quarter briefly.  As we all know, the fourth quarter of 2008 was extremely challenging for the retail industry as the consume stayed home, traded down, and in some categories, simply stopped buying.", "In the face of these headwinds, our team continued to take the necessary actions to change the merchandise offering, intensify customer engagement, and tightly control costs.  As a result of these efforts, we\u2019ve produced solid operating earnings.", "For the holiday season 2008, we refined our strategy as we planned purchasing less giftable inventory and focused our gift assortments on items that supported our customers\u2019 basic lifestyle needs at compelling value prices.", "We\u2019re pleased with our ability to navigate through the quarter by properly managing our up front buying and highlighting more every day basics, thus reducing exposure to markdowns and improving inventory productivity.", "Throughout the year we saw consumers shifting purchases from wants to need and from style to value, and the fourth quarter was no different.  While the holiday season was challenging, our team correctly anticipated consumer buying patterns and executed very well.  As I mentioned last week, we believe our operating performance in 2008 represented one of our strongest periods every for the company.", "I want to thank our team members for their hard work and consistent execution this year.  We remain committed to offering great prices and merchandise assortments that are core to our customers\u2019 rural lifestyle needs and we successfully executed the fundamentals of our business model.", "Early in the year our team recognized the external challenges and we adjusted our strategies accordingly.  Overall, I\u2019m proud of our steadfast efforts to grow and to improve our business.  To provide more detail behind our growth drivers for 2008 I\u2019ll discuss some operational highlights.", "First, we grew our business with sales increasing 11.3% and comps by 1.4.  Further, we expanded the chain by 12%.  We opened 91 new stores and ended the year with 855 stores.  We\u2019re very encouraged by performance of our new stores and we are pleased to reduce the cost of stores open in 2008 and also those that we approved during the year.", "To further support our growth, we added 250,000 square feet of capacity to our distribution center in Waco, Texas. Second, we refined our merchandising selection and focused on core, non-discretionary basic products.  Our core consumable business remains strong as our customers continue to purchase items that are relevant to our every day needs for their land, their animals, and their pets.  This helped us drive traffic to our stores throughout the year.", "We also made progress on our integrated multi-channel strategy by enhancing our e-commerce offering with a more robust website. We\u2019ve seen a marked increase in the number of consumers who shop online prior to visiting one of our stores.", "Throughout the year we challenged the paradigm and rigorously worked towards improving various areas of our business.  First, we implanted an aggressive expense management program early in the year.  Through this we tightly managed costs at the store support center and in our stores without compromising customer service.  Our team responded well to this initiative and we believe we are better positioned to operate as a leaner organization going forward.", "Second, we made progress in our merchandising initiatives.  Specifically, we navigated the extreme volatility in grain, steel, and petroleum costs by successfully balancing the inflation and cost of goods against our moving average costs, the prevailing market retail price, our margin targets, and our market share goals.", "The smart and diligent work of our merchants and finance teams allowed us to hold or gain share while improving merchandise margin.  Furthermore, the transportation team did a great job of managing the unexpected and unprecedented spike in fuel costs.", "Additionally, we made improvements in inventory management.  As planned, we significantly reduced the clutter in our stores by moving through discontinued and aged inventory and refocused our mix more towards basic categories.  With that in mind, I\u2019m very pleased that we ended the year with cleaner inventory, particularly for our core and seasonal items.  Further, we exceeded our goal to improve our inventory terms by 15 basis points this last year.", "Third, we made significant progress in customer satisfaction.  The fourth quarter 2007 was our first full year of collecting CSI data and at that time we were proud to find ourselves in the top quartile of hard line retail.  We are very pleased that our store teams raised our top box score another 4% in Q4 of \u201908.", "Once again, we\u2019ve lowered our store manager and store team member turnover.  These two significant achievements were produced while we asked our store team members to do more with less.  Finally, we made substantial progress at our CRM strategy.  We are now positioned to leverage our customer database going forward.  We\u2019ll pursue profitable comp sales and hold all media costs to a high ROI standard.", "Taken together, our actions this year allowed us to maintain strong capital structure.  Our balance sheet is solid with essentially no long term debt at the end of the year.  We maintained ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business for the long term while strategically repurchasing shares to maximize shareholder value.", "In conclusion, our team attacked the functionaries of retailing, including strong merchandising, superior customer service, and sound operational procedures.  These efforts, combined with the resiliency of our business model and the leadership of our management team allowed us to remain relevant to our customers throughout the year and to generate positive results.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tony who will review our financial performance and discuss our full year outlook.  He will also address some of the questions we received regarding the LIFO provision call last week.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone.  As we said, we were very pleased with the operating performance for the quarter.  We achieved double digit sales growth and continued to manage our clearance process and inventory levels.", "For the fourth quarter ended December 27, 2008, sales were $799.5 million and net income was $24.7 million or $0.67 per diluted share.  Excluding LIFO, net income was $37.2 million or $1.01 per diluted share compared to $31.6 million or $0.81 per diluted share in the same period last year.", "As discussed last week, the company will restate its financial results for the first three quarters of fiscal 2008 to reflect an adjustment to the company\u2019s LIFO provision.  All figures discussed here have taken the effect of the restatement into account.  For comparative purposes, we are providing gross margin and net income metrics both including and excluding LIFO.", "I\u2019ll review some of the drivers of each P&L line item but please note that gross margin improvement excluding LIFO expense management and lower pre-opening expenses were all drivers of our substantially stronger than expected performance in the quarter.", "Total comp sales for the period increased 1.3% and non comp sales were approximately $65.6 million or 8.2% of sales.  Comp transaction count increased 1% and we are pleased that we continue to drive footsteps into the store.", "Average comp ticket increased 0.3% due to the inflation on commodity related items offset by a decrease in big ticket item sales.  Our core consumable categories continue to be the key driver of the business.  We also had strong sales in our heating consumables but had some difficulty obtaining enough product from suppliers as many customers made advance purchases in the third quarter.", "While some discretionary and big ticket items categories performed well, such as alternative heating stoves and chain saws, we saw that consumers are still electing to postpone big ticket purchases when they have discretion.  We experienced that in categories such as recreational vehicles and trailers.", "We also had lower emergency response equipment sales such as generators and portable heaters because there were several severe storms in the prior year.  We continue to slight a slight comp decline in our housing related categories but the decline continues to narrow compared to the prior year\u2019s decline.", "Weather did not play a significant factor on a year-over-year comparable basis, although temperatures overall were just slightly cooler on average for each month, there was less severe storm activity during the quarter.", "With respect to regional sales trends, comp sales were the strongest in the southwest and the north and weakest in the southeast.  Year-over-year the southeast had more moisture in the second half of the year which had an inverse relationship to feed sales. Of note, California and Michigan had an above average comp while the Florida economy continues to struggle.", "Comp sales in our Del stores were negative, significantly higher hay prices and compressed demand for discretionary items continue to have a negative impact on the consumer in the quarter.  Jim will discuss Del\u2019s in more detail later in the call.", "Turning now to gross margin, compared to the prior year quarter, we experienced a decline of approximately 191 basis points.  Excluding the 219 basis point impact of LIFO, we had an improvement of 28 basis points as increased freight costs were offset by improved shrink, vendor allowances, and mark down management.", "Freight expense increased by 33 basis points.  Although fuel costs declined significantly as we moved through the fourth quarter, the lower fuel cost pushed down the moving average cost slowly, therefore the benefit is somewhat delayed.  Our LIFO allowance increased by 219 basis points over the prior year quarter, driven by a significant change in product mix caused by our aggressive clearance activity and commodity driven price increases experienced throughout the year.", "On last weeks\u2019 conference call we discussed more detailed information about the LIFO calculation and additional supplemental schedules are in today\u2019s press release.  We continued our phased markdown strategy for seasonal product and certain non go forward inventory as part of our efforts to keep the inventory fresh.", "We were pleased with the support we received from our vendors. We also continued to focus on buying efficiencies and inventory management to offset a portion of the margin impact of seasonal clearance activity.", "Imports as a percentage of purchases in the quarter decreased 284 basis points from the prior year quarter and 100 basis points for the full year period as part of our strategy to limit import holiday gifts and utilize more everyday basics.  More importantly we saw our sales from import goods increase almost 15 basis points for the year and they now represent approximately 7.4% of our sales.", "For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, as a percent of sales, was 25.6% which is flat compared to the same quarter in the prior year.  Overall we are pleased with the SG&A leverage we achieved, especially in light of the limited comp store sales increase.", "Store occupancy costs continued o be our biggest opportunity but it is beginning to moderate and the expense was offset b y other SG&A categories that we did leverage.  We leveraged our advertising costs from the prior year quarter, we focused more of our marketing efforts on direct mail, and less on television media, allowing us a more targeted approach to drive business with existing and prospective customers.", "The pre-opening expenses for new stores were approximately $1.7 million compared to $2.7 million in the prior year quarter.  In the fourth quarter we opened 21 stores compared to 26 store openings last year.  For the year we opened 91 stores compared to 89 store openings last year.", "Turning to the balance sheet, as we have discussed, we are very diligent with our inventory management program in 2008.  At quarter end inventory levels per store were down approximately 8.2% compared to the prior year.  Our calculation is based on average cost of inventory and excludes in transit inventory and inventory held in unopened stores.  Inventory turns were 2.79 for the year, a 19 basis point improvement.", "We anticipate our improved inventory management will continue into next year.  We also improved accounts payable financing of inventory of approximately 38.3% up to 43% driven by the improved turns and our merchants\u2019 negotiations with our vendors.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $22.9 million.  As anticipated the majority of the spend relates to our new store opening program.  For 2008 CapEx came in as expected at $91.8 million which includes $8.5 million for the acquisition of two store properties in the first quarter.  CapEx for the full year of 2007 totaled $83.5 million.", "During the fourth quarter we continued to make purchases under a stock repurchase program.  We bought approximately 318,000 shares for $11.4 million for a cumulative total of approximately $204 million since the inception of the program in February of 2007.  The shares repurchase program impact on EPS for the quarter was not significant.", "We are pleased that we ended the year in a net investment position.  This is a substantial accomplishment as we have offset over $53 million of stock repurchases and paid down $55 million in debt during the year through our inventory and vendor financing initiatives.", "We would like to reiterate our confidence in our liquidity position.  We are very comfortable with our position as our revolving credit facility is $350 million and does not expire until 2012.  Including our restated results, we were still well within our covenant.  We generated cash flow from operations of $217.5 million more than in any other year, and net of capital expenditures we had free cash flow for the full year of $3.35 per share.", "Now turning our attention to 2009, first, let me provide you with our outlook for a few key metrics.  We expect full year sales to range from approximately $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion.  We have forecasted comp sales to be in the range of a decline of 1.5% to an increase of 1.5%.  We expect EBIT margin to increase around 50 basis points for 2009 and excluding LIFO, we expect EBIT margin to decrease approximately 45 basis points.", "We anticipate net income to range from approximately $95 million to $101 million or $2.58 to $2.74 per diluted share.  Net income includes a LIFO projection of approximately $9.6 million after tax or $0.26 per diluted share.  Excluding LIFO, we anticipate net income to range from $2.84 to $3.00 per diluted share.", "Let me discuss some of the more specific drivers and assumptions that helped us form our expectations for 2009.  We anticipate a tough retail environment that will be less tolerant of retail price increases and in a potentially deflationary environment, the retail consumer would expect retail price decrease.  While this could impact sales, we would expect to mitigate margin impact by carefully managing gross margin as we did in 2008.", "We anticipate expansion of gross margin profits from our merchandise initiatives and a more favorable trend in freight costs.  We anticipate gross margin will benefit from price optimization, assortment planning, improved product allocation, private label offering, better strategic sourcing, and less clearance activity.  Additionally, we expect fuel prices to be lower on average throughout the year.  We anticipate our pre-tax LIFO provision will be approximately $15.7 million.", "With comp sales anticipated to be less robust within this retail environment, we believe it will be more difficult to leverage our SG&A expenses as we continue our commitment to grow our store base.", "Occupancy costs have historically had a deleveraging impact and we expect this will continue until the new stores reach maturity.  We have successfully executed several initiatives to drive down the occupancy costs as a part of our efforts to be more efficient with our capital.", "For marketing, field management, and distribution center expenses in 2009, we expect that they will roughly be flat as a percent of sales.  We anticipate higher store expenses as we incur roll out costs of the new POS beginning in the third quarter and anticipate slightly higher store incentive compensation compared to 2008.", "We have planned that our store support center costs will deleverage slightly as we cycle prior years\u2019 staff additions.  As we demonstrated in 2008, there are several levers that we can control when managing the expense line items.  We will judiciously allocate resources based on the company\u2019s performance throughout the year.", "We forecast that our effective tax rate will increase to 38.9% from 38.6%.   This results principally from a FIN 48 reversal arising from state tax settlement realized in 2008 which is not anticipated in 2009 and expected increases in state taxes.", "Total capital expenditures are expected to range between $85 million and $95 million which is in line with 2008.  As we said on our third quarter call, we planned to open approximately 70 to 80 stores in 2009 and don\u2019t expect to open any Del stores.  Similar to the store opening strategy executed in 2008, we expect to open approximately 60% of the stores in the first half of the year.  We expect to relocate one store in 2009.  We\u2019ll update you through the year if market conditions dictate a change in our approach.", "Comparing our CapEx spending for 2009 with last year, in 2008 we opened 10 to 20 more stores than we anticipate opening in 2009 and we spent $11 million on our Waco distribution facility expansion.  However, we anticipate replacing those investments with store refurbishment, upgrade in IT hardware, and other efficient driving system enhancements in 2009.", "Although we believe it is likely we will make further purchases under our stock repurchase program as part of our long term objective of reducing our cost of capital, we do not include potential future repurchases in our forecast.  As always, this will be subject to prevailing market conditions and overall market volatility.", "As we emphasized in the past, we believe our business can be more accurately assessed by looking at the halves, not the quarters, as the weather can significantly change and shift the timing of our sales.  Some key points with respect to the quarters:  as you know, Q1 is our get ready quarter for the spring and results can vary significantly dependent on an early or late spring. Expect that we will have a slight loss in the first quarter.  Additionally, we expect to open up to30 stores in Q1 with the corresponding pre-opening expense.", "Further, keep in mind that we have one more comp day in the first quarter as we are closed on Easter which shifts to April this year from March.  We estimate that this could increase comps by approximately 1.5% in Q1 and an approximate 1% reduction in Q2.", "From a weather perspective, we expect the quarter to be relatively consistent with the prior year with the prospect of a slightly warmer March in the northern states.  For the back half of the year, keep in mind that the third quarter sales in 2008 were bolstered by hurricane activity and heating related sales that were pulled forward from the fourth quarter.  At the same time, we did experience a lower margin from the mix of emergency response equipment and we also took an additional reserve for clearance merchandise.  We also expect to incur additional payroll in Q3 as we anticipate to be in full swing as the POS roll out.", "We believe the fourth quarter has less gross margin upside potential because we will be cycling positive shrink, vendor allowances, and discounts and clearance markdown management.  However, this is also the quarter that we believe has the most opportunity for earnings improvement due to the softer comp comparison.  As in the past, we will provide more color on our expectations for the subsequent period at each quarterly conference call.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jim for more details on our plans for 2009.", "James F. Wright", "Thanks, Tony.  We\u2019re excited about our opportunities this year.  While we believe our plans are realistic for the existing economic outlook, we will continue to monitor the underlying trends to remain nimble and adjust our plans quickly if there are any significant positive or negative changes.  Throughout \u201909 we will continue differentiating Tractor Supply Company in the market and executing our retail strategy to win in the current environment and beyond.", "Let me go into more detail into both of these priorities.  We serve an attractive niche.  We will remain committed to supporting the functional needs of those living the rural lifestyle.  While we are not immune to the challenges in the macro environment, we continue to see relative strength in both the consumers and the markets we serve.  Our customers are fiscally conservative.  They have proven to be more resilient and less reliant on credit than the average.  Further, the initial approval rate for new applicants on our Tractor Supply consumer credit card remains strong.", "As you know, our unique mix of merchandise is the foundation of our business.  I am pleased with our efforts to ensure that we continuously offer a variety of products that are relevant to the customer\u2019s lifestyle and make our stores a destination.  We\u2019ll continue refining our merchandise assortment and expect to direct more of our mix towards consumable products and basic lifestyle items that we can offer at compelling values.", "We expect these categories such as animal health and pet related products will drive sales growth and repeat business, especially in a difficult economy.  Throughout the year we\u2019ll also be focused on further reducing our dependency on discretionary and big ticket items by significantly scaling back this inventory.  We did well with this strategy in 2008 and expect that applying those learnings will allow us t produce more gross margin and further improve working capital this year.", "We continue to focus on strategic direct sourcing and increasing our private label business which allows us to offer the best products for our customers from both a quality and value perspective at attractive margins.  Over the long term we target 13% of sales from strategic direct sourcing and 25% from private label sales.", "Our customers\u2019 shopping experience in our stores and our website helps define Tractor Supply Company and it is critical in shaping their impression of the brand.  In this environment it\u2019s even more important to identify opportunities for attracting and retaining customers.  Our associates allow us to deliver a differentiated level of service because they understand and live the rural lifestyle.  We are maintaining our [inaudible] development and training programs because we know our customers benefit from their in depth expertise.", "Our marketing efforts will remain an important way to drive traffic and to a somewhat lesser degree, strengthen the brand.  We believe there are opportunities to refine our marketing efforts this year.", "John Wendler, who joined us as Senior Vice President of Marketing at the end of 2008, will be instrumental in enhancing customer relationship management, customer loyalty, and private label brand programs this year.  We believe reallocating more of our advertising spend through our CRM program will provide us with the most efficient way to reach current and prospective customers.", "[inaudible] identify the needs of many of our customers, attract their purchasing behavior, and target their future purchases. Over the long term we continue to believe our CRM program will position us to grow profitability per household by increasing market share of our targeted customers and provide insight into our customers\u2019 shopping behaviors across our channels.", "Our merchants and marketers are rigorously using the margin dollars net of advertising metric in their decisions and planning.  The retail marketplace today is very noisy and media is becoming increasingly inefficient.  We believe that every dollar spent on media must produce a margin dollar on the lift above the cost of that media.  We will use media to continue to gain market share in those categories we intend to dominate.  We will also continue to offer our customers great day in and day out pricing while concurrently improving our comp margin dollars.", "We view 2009 as another year of learning for Del\u2019s.  We continue to see the consumer responding well to non-discretionary merchandise such as heating and pet food; however, spending and discretion items such as clothing and gifts has declined.  While we made some adjustments to the operating structure in 2008, we are still working to improve this business and to increase the productivity of the new stores in the non-core markets for Del\u2019s.  We will be monitoring this progress very closely in the first three quarters of this year.", "At the same time we\u2019ve applied some of our learnings from Del\u2019s to our Tractor Supply stores.  We\u2019ve started selling hay in some stores and are testing bulk propane with good success in others.", "Returning to our second primary effort for 2009, we\u2019re actually through our retail strategy centered store expansion, rigorous inventory management, and expense management programs.  As planned, we\u2019ll be more cautious with store expansion program in the near term due to the current economic backdrop.  Importantly, though, we will remain a growth company.  As such, well continue to capitalize on opportunities to expand the chain.", "Success of our store model is evident both by the outstanding performance of our existing stores and the ramp up of our new stores which continued to exceed our expectations.  We expect to make further progress on inventory management program and we\u2019ve recently added some additional resources to improve forecasting and replenishment.  The same team will also allow us to take the next steps in price optimization.  We will carefully manage our inventory levels while ensuring that we have excellent in stocks on key items at all times.", "We would also expect more timely and cleaner exits from seasonal inventory.  We\u2019ll continue to work on improving inventory turnover.  We believe it\u2019s important to maintain our aggressive expense management program given the uncertainty in the economy.  We\u2019ll continue to evaluate additional leverage we can pull if needed by reducing incremental discretionary costs without sacrificing customer service.", "While there is no doubt the American consumer has changed, we believe that we are well-positioned to win in any environment.  Simply put, the priorities we have defined for this year have been communicated to our store support center and our field management team.  We are aligned, we are confident, and we are well prepared for 2009 and the future.", "This will conclude our prepared remarks. Operator, we\u2019d like to open the call to questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mitch Kaiser with Piper Jaffray.", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray", "One of the things I really liked about the prepared remarks is that you are assuming a warmer March in the northern states.  We\u2019d really appreciate that.  Just want to understand, I know that there\u2019s a lot of noise around the margins and things like that, but you said EBIT margin was going to be up 50 basis points inclusive of LIFO but down 45 if we exclude that.  Is that purely a function of the roughly flat comp at the midpoint to the guidance or could you just kind of take us through your overall thinking on that.  I know you gave a lot of detail on that but if you could help us on that, it would help.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Mitch, you\u2019re asking about the impact of LIFO within the range itself?", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray", "I think, Tony, you said that your EBIT margin guidance was up 50 basis points but ex LIFO would be down 45, right?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Right.", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray", "So the down 45, is that a function of basically being a flat comp at the midpoint of the guidance range?  The deleverage on the SG&A?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "The deleverage on the SG&A clearly is a result of the limited comp that we\u2019re projecting for the full year.  So in excluding the LIFO adjustment, we will have some margin improvement that will not fully offset the SG&A deleverage, if that\u2019s where you --", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray", "No, that\u2019s exactly, that\u2019s very helpful.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "That\u2019s absolutely the case.", "Mitch Kaiser - Piper Jaffray", "Okay.  Then with CapEx roughly at $90 million, what would you, and I know that there\u2019s going to be some working capital improvements, you guys have done a very good job on that, what would you expect, kind of free cash to be if you were to assume kind of the midpoint of the guidance range on EPS?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "On EPS, we\u2019re looking for it to be in a similar range as we put together this year so we finished at about the $3.35 in the prepared remarks, so we expect to be in that range as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jack Murphy from William Blair.", "Jack Murphy - William Blair & Company", "Just on the gross margin in the quarter.  On the components of the improvement of shrink and [inaudible] allowances and mark down management, are those roughly equal contributors, and then secondly, on the shrink in particular, could you just give us a sense of what your absolute shrink ratio is at this point and what you think the risks are of that going in backing up and going against you next year?", "James F. Wright", "Let me speak to the shrink.  We don\u2019t give out the detail.  We\u2019ve been expecting to see an increase in shrink on a year-over-year basis due to the number of unemployed and so forth.  That\u2019s why we have not seen that, so shrink has actually been marginally better year-over-year and we\u2019ve not seen any increase in the shrink factor as we\u2019ve gone throughout the four quarters of \u201908.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "The relationship to the gross margin performance, vendor allowances were slightly ahead of a year ago but they were in relationship to the mix of products that to be honest with you performed better or worse from a year ago.  Secondly we really managed the seasonal transition from fall to Christmas to spring far better this year than last year.  I think that\u2019s one of the issues that saved us a ton of dollars in markdowns, so we really... the exchange there was fewer markdowns, acting faster on sole selling products, transitioning faster to spring, if you were in our stores you would have seen some spring products in our stores in the late fourth quarter where in years past it would have been first quarter, so it was just kind of a shift in momentum but it worked very, very well for us.", "James F. Wright", "To answer your question, I would break those three in fairly equal components.", "Jack Murphy - William Blair & Company", "Just one follow up on the SG&A.  If you were to do something below the negative 1.5, does the deleverage in the model become much greater?  I assume that you can\u2019t do a lot more with staffing levels in the store given you need sort of minimum coverage in terms of keeping the service levels high, so could you talk a little bit about that, in the event that you do worse on the comp line, just how much greater the deleverage becomes.", "James F. Wright", "There are a couple different levers as we move down that continuum in the model.  Obviously there\u2019s the incentive compensation piece that tends to be a little bit of a trigger as well, so there\u2019s not a significant fall off.  I would model it more in a ratable manner as opposed to sort of a steep decline after the negative 1.5.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Peter Benedict from Wachovia.", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets", "First on the POS system, can you talk a little bit about the cost there?  What\u2019s the magnitude, what should we be thinking about in the second half of \u201909, and what kind of benefits do you guys expect to get from the new system?", "James F. Wright", "We\u2019ll take it in two parts.  When it comes to the expense side, we had outfitted the stores with any type of hardware that is required in the previous year.  We\u2019re looking at some additional software expenses.  It ranges in the sort of the $2 million to $3 million range.  So it\u2019s a valuable investment but not overly significant.  Then as it relates to the benefits that we expect to inure from the system itself, let me turn that over to Stan to give you some highlights.", "Stanley L. Ruta", "The benefits of the POS, really two big areas.  Number one, the customer experience and secondly, what the system is going to help us learn about our customer.  In terms of the customer experience, it\u2019s speed of checkout.  The transactions are going to be faster, notably faster on the specialty transactions like return transactions, layaways, and special orders, will be much faster for our customer.", "The new system is going to give us the ability to take checks electronically so that will not only speed up the process at the point of sale but it will also eliminate us from having to process checks at night because it\u2019s all going to be electronic, so we\u2019ll save some labor there while increasing transaction speed.  The system is going to be much easier for our team members to learn.  It\u2019s a touch screen system and it\u2019s much more intuitive than what we currently have, and it will give us real time inventory so we\u2019ll have better inventory accuracy in the store to speed up our customer service.", "The information capture is significantly more than what we have today.  It will increase our ability to understand the market basket and what our customers are buying at the SKU level as well as how often they\u2019re buying that merchandise, and we\u2019ll get that info whenever we get their name on check transactions, bank card transactions, or tax exempt transactions, and this information will really be used by the marketing department in our direct mail programs and the CRM program that Jim talked about earlier.  We\u2019ll also get some significant LP controls and information that will help our LP department measure fraud in refunds and other areas.", "Then lastly, we will get a little bit of cost savings out of it.  The new system will help us eliminate counter tickets in our store.  It will help us remove some equipment that we\u2019re leasing today and we\u2019ll probably save $300,000 to $400,000 a year when those things go away, but overall the new system is better, faster, it\u2019s more efficient, and it\u2019s going to improve our customer shopping experience while helping us become a little smarter about our customer.", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Switching over, Tony, I guess, or on the free cash flow front, if you guys are going to generate another $100 plus million in free cash flow net year, I know you\u2019re not assuming some buybacks, I assume there will be some there, what are other uses of the free cash flow would you guys consider for \u201909?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Good question, Peter.  When we look at it, obviously we look at the stock repurchase programs first, but secondly, our real estate program, we\u2019re going to assess it as far as what assistance developers may need and as far as acquiring really grade A sites as we move forward.  We\u2019ll have to make an assessment as to how we\u2019re going to utilize our balance sheet to make those deals work.", "At this point in time, it has not become an issue, but it\u2019s one area that we\u2019ve targeted potentially in 2009 where we can utilize that additional free cash flow.", "Peter Benedict - Wachovia Capital Markets", "One last question.  Just on the pre-opening cost trend down nicely in the back half of \u201908, down about 20% to 30% I guess year-over-year on a per-store basis.  How should we be thinking about the pre-opening costs for the stores that you\u2019ve got on tap for \u201909?", "James F. Wright", "It generally is going to be a similar spread based on the number of stores that I\u2019ve provided as far as the rollout, about 60% of the stores in the first half.  The one thing that we\u2019ve focused on at the end of 2008 was to reduce the number of store openings in January.  That reduced the pre-opening that we would normally incur in the December month as well as January is really our weakest sales month as well, so it behooved us on two fronts to push January openings into more the February/March time frame.  Other than that, the roll out and the approximate cost to open the store remain about the same.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Nemer with Thomas Weisel Partners .", "Matt Nemer - Thomas Weisel Partners", "My first question is, in a less inflationary environment, how are you thinking about balancing maybe the capture some incremental gross margins as your costs come down versus market share?  Is that by category or maybe give us a little bit of color on how you\u2019re going to balance those two.", "James F. Wright", "As we looked at last year, we had to maintain margin and market share on the way up and frankly as we experienced some deflation in the steel, petroleum, and grain, we\u2019ve managed it the same way on the way down with really an eye towards maintaining margin dollars, not necessarily rate, but margin dollars, and we view it as we think a significant opportunity to gain share in some categories that are most important to us.", "Matt Nemer - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Then the second question, can you give us any detail on customer behavior in the pet category?  Have you seen any evidence that it seems like if somebody\u2019s getting a pink slip, it\u2019s only intuitive to me that they might decide not to buy the highest quality of Nutro and maybe trade in to one of your private label brands but just curious as to what you\u2019re seeing there.", "James F. Wright", "We have seen some trade down with some customers but in the general text of how our business is operating, we\u2019re very pleased that we haven\u2019t seen any massive moves yet.  We are very cautious on how we price both our private brand and national brands and keep those spreads fairly consistent and as inflation rose, both of those followed suit and as deflation comes into play, it would be the same, so there\u2019s not going to be less feeding of animals or pets but there could be some additional trade off and we\u2019ve actually planned for that. We anticipate some of that.", "Matt Nemer - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Do you have any data that would sort of explain how somebody is trading down and perhaps trading out, is there any way to determine where they\u2019re going, if they would be going to a Wal-mart or Target or Pet Smart or kind of what channel, if they were migrating away from your store, is there any way to determine where they\u2019re going?", "James F. Wright", "Actually we believe we\u2019re taking share in the pet food particularly and frankly in the pet category.  It continues to be part of our very best comp performing categories.  The trade down within the category which I really don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any trading up going on, the trading down within the category, if someone trades from grocery to or private brand, they win and we win.  They save $5 a bag and we make a little more margin dollar.  We\u2019re fine with that one.  We\u2019ve not seen a lot of trade down from premium brand to grocery thus far.  We\u2019ve seen some trade down within premium but again, the yield on all those brands is fairly comparable to us and frankly what complicates it is if the consumer goes down the price continuum, they win, and we do as well.", "Matt Nemer - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Lastly, on the expense side, is there an opportunity to renegotiate occupancy expense?  How many leases do you have coming due this year, next year, and do you have any issues where a co-tenancy change or an occupancy change maybe allows you to go back in and renegotiate?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "On all leases that are coming up, they come through real estate committee first of all and we can take a look at them and on each of them we are going back to the landlord and if we want to stay in that location which most of them would do, we go to the landlord at that time and we renegotiate a new term at our existing rent without wanting to pay the additional increase that is due.  We just started that over the last four months or so and we\u2019re having some success and it\u2019s early and we\u2019ll probably report more on it as time goes on but we are having some success as landlords realize this environment is a little bit different.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan Wewer from Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "[inaudible] correctly that you anticipate fourth quarter of \u201909 would be your best same-store sales opportunity?", "James F. Wright", "That is correct.  We saw softer comps in Q4 as well as in Q1.  In Q1 though, I want to caution as in my notes, that there is a shift of the comp date.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "I was thinking that with inflation benefiting fourth quarter \u201908 same store sales by 4 percentage points and the chance that we could be seeing deflation in the fourth quarter of \u201909 that it could actually be a challenging quarter from that perspective?", "James F. Wright", "That is absolutely a possibility and I think you could make that statement about all four quarters in looking at the sales and the type of sales that we had in Q4 by category, we believe that there\u2019s some upside that would offset some of that deflationary pressure if it does occur, and also as we noted, we felt that there was a shift, the heating sales into Q3, that normalized would translate back into Q4 in 2009.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Second question on the real estate, I know that your unit expansion rate is slower than you were running a few years ago, but nevertheless it\u2019s still one of the fast hardline retail other retailers are telling us that properties aren\u2019t developing as quickly as they wanted due to financing issues.  Could you tell us on the 70 to 80 stores that you\u2019re planning to open, how many of those have actually been secure in the leases refined?", "Stanley L. Ruta", "There might be one or two for \u201909 that haven\u2019t been signed [inaudible].", "James F. Wright", "We are into \u201910 in some commitments already.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "And with the silver mile strategy, can you remind me how the prices on these leases compare with opening say a year or two years ago?", "James F. Wright", "I guess the most significant thing, if we looked at the metric I have in hand, if we look at the new stores, all of them combined, prototype and second use real estate that we approved in 2006 versus those that we approved in 2008, our rent and depreciation, whichever it is, is 120 basis points lower for the stores that we approved in \u201908 as a percent of sales when compared to \u201906.  We\u2019ve been very successful in those initiatives and we continue to test and push and take cost out.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "I think the last question I had was on Jim\u2019s comments on Del\u2019s, I want to make sure I understand the issue, if that the new store productivity in the non-core markets is not where you want it to be, is that correct?", "James F. Wright", "Yes, that\u2019s correct, again, the markets are really very different from eastern Washington through western Washington, and that impacted the merchandise mix much more significantly than we anticipated.  We are recasting that merchandise mix right now and we\u2019ll need I think through Q3 to fully understand what the potential of those markets is.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "When do you think you\u2019ll be able to make a long term decision on Del\u2019s?", "James F. Wright", "I would think over the next 3 to 5 quarters we\u2019ll have a good idea of how fast we\u2019re going to grow it and where we\u2019re going to grow it, if we\u2019re going to grow it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Lawrence from Morgan Keegan.", "John Lawrence - Morgan Keegan", "On merchandise mix for \u201909 as it relates to private label, give us a little breakdown.  You mentioned pets and feed related consumables but how would the breakdown go between say C. E. Schmidt, Masterhand, and Red Shed looking to \u201909 as far as your expansion of those SKUs?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Let me kind of break them up a little bit.  C. E. Schmidt will expand with the work wear strategy and the focus we have in that category of business, so we\u2019re going to be adding more components, probably female component by the end of third quarter.  It\u2019s performed well and it continues to be a good I\u2019d call it stair step to the Carhartt brand which of course we do a wonderful job with [inaudible] tractor.  As far as Red Shed and the gift category, very cautious approach.", "We\u2019ve had to retrench, pull back, and really kind of assort based upon what the consumer would expect to pay, number one, and number two, the kind of and type of items that are more day in and day out not driven so much and solely towards holiday type purchasing. Our consumer looks at that as very discretionary and so we\u2019ve really kind of refocused our efforts there.  We think we\u2019ve got that on a very positive note as we go into the spring and into the fall so pretty comfortable with that.", "As far as Master Hand, that\u2019s the tool category, we are working through right now re-establishing the brand in first the hand tool segment.  If you think about Craftsman, it took them many many years to build the brand and they started with hand tools.  You\u2019ve got to get the tools in customers\u2019 hands and use and from there it will move the brand back in again under the power tool category but be very cautious, probably overstepped our bounds in 2007 and early 2008 there.  Then I think we have to understand is where we play off on the tool mix and for us there\u2019s an opening price and then there\u2019s probably the Master Hand which is a step up.", "We feel very good about it, we are probably in the early stages of that relaunch.  You\u2019ll see more in the stores the latter part of second and third quarter.", "John Lawrence - Morgan Keegan", "Any new brands you\u2019re thinking about?", "James F. Wright", "actually, no, not at this time, it\u2019s more of editing what we had.  I think that there\u2019s nothing out there that I see today except for maybe some acquisition on the feeder food side and I\u2019ll leave it at that, but nothing in the private label sector that we\u2019ve got it in the hopper right now.", "Operator", "This concludes our conference call today.  Please continue with any closing comments.", "James F. Wright", "Thanks again for your support, great to talk to you all on the call.  While we are in a very volatile environment, there\u2019s lots of things around the corner that we may not be able to fully anticipate.  When I look at the issues of our business within the control of this management team, I have never been more confident in our ability to plan correctly, to execute crisply, and to continue to build a great team of merchants and operating executives.", "So I look forward to \u201909 with great confidence on those things that we can control and also our ability to react quickly to those things that we cannot control.  Thank you very much, talk to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, you may all disconnect, and thank you for participating.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.  (Operator Instructions)", "Please be advised that reproductions of this call in whole or in part is not permitted without prior written authorization of Tractor Supply Company and as a reminder ladies and gentlemen this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Miss Cara O\u2019Brien of Financial Dynamics.", "Cara O\u2019Brien ", "Before we begin we would like to take a moment to reference the Safe Harbor Provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the future operating and financial performance of the company.", "Although the company believes that the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable it can give no assurance that such expectations or any of its forward-looking statements will prove to be correct.  Important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements are included in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "The information contained in this call is accurate only as of the date discussed.  Investors should not assume that the statements will remain operative at a later time.  Lastly Tractor Supply Company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed in this call.  Now I am pleased to introduce Mr. Jim Wright, Chairman and CEO.", "James F. Wright ", "I\u2019m joined today by Tony Crudele, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Sandfort, our President and Chief Merchandising Officer; and Stan Ruta, our Chief Operating Officer.  As you know the first quarter represents a get ready quarter for us as we prepare for the important spring selling season.  Though the first quarter is always the smallest quarter for us we are pleased with our performance and believe we\u2019re off to a good start for the year.", "During the quarter we made solid progress on our key priorities for 2009 which are to continue differentiating our business and executing our retail strategy to win in the current environment and beyond.  Let me briefly discuss some of the highlights.  First we grew the business as we increased total sales by nearly 13% to $650 million, improved gross margin by 40 basis points to 30.9%.", "As a result we were able to improve our bottom line on a year-over-year basis by $0.06 per diluted share to a profit of $0.01 per diluted share.  Second our team did a great job of ensuring their stores remain a destination and as a result our customers continued to respond positively and have increased their visits.", "Although average ticket was done which Tony will discuss later we experienced a marked improvement in traffic during the quarter which we attribute primarily to the focus we\u2019ve placed on having the right mix of everyday and advertised merchandise to keep our customers coming back.  Let me go into more detail on both of these items.", "Starting with our merchandise as you heard us mention we believe there\u2019s been a fundamental shift in consumer shopping habits from wants to needs and from style to value.  Due to our response to these trends we\u2019ve not seen any real deterioration in our customers\u2019 willingness or ability to shop for products that fit the everyday needs for their rural lifestyle.", "We continue to emphasize and appropriate stock our CUE items which stands for consumables, usables and edibles.  These products are also highly represented in what we call our 20 to 50 which represents our focus on being in stock on products in the top 20 categories ad the top 250 skews within those categories.  We\u2019ve also built a strong reputation with our communities for being a reliable source for emergency preparation and response items.", "During the quarter we experienced demand for product such as generators and emergency pumps as a result of the impact of ice storms in the South and flooding in the upper Midwest.  Turning to our marketing program we are benefiting from our efforts to improve our marketing while leveraging advertising dollars.", "Our emphasis on value, less clutter and more education is working well and our advertising campaigns, marketing and merchandising remain important elements of our strategy to differentiate our business.  Additionally we are closely monitoring gross margin dollars net of advertising on an internal basis to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of each event.  I\u2019ll talk more about these major components on our business later in the call.", "Third as part of our effort to reduce costs in the business and to improve margin I am pleased with the progress we made with transportation and freight.  We\u2019ve increased the efficiency of our distribution centers by in-sourcing the management of freight movement from our DCs to our stores.  We are also utilizing our trailers more productively by improving our CUE utilization and reducing empty miles by using common carriers more frequently.", "The benefits of these actions are beginning to gain traction.  At a recent investment community day we announced that we\u2019ve increased our long term store target to 1,800 domestic TSC stores.  We evaluated metrics such as county and state demographics, known competition, distance from our distribution centers.", "We calculated in depth sales and RLI projections and we further examined the characteristics of the world population with 20 and 40 minute drives times of our desired locations.  We\u2019re excited about this growth opportunity and confident that we\u2019ll be able to achieve this target based on the success of our site selection model and the performance of the nearly 400 new stores we\u2019ve opened in the last five years.", "Overall in our first quarter we continued to execute on our initiatives which are centered on strong merchandising, sound operational procedures and superior service.  These are driven by our commitments to connect with our customers and offer them a complete and compelling assortment of the basic item they need for their rural lifestyles.", "We continue to benefit from the strength of our business model, our unique niche and our customers\u2019 and team\u2019s ability to continue to win in this challenging retail environment.  I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tony to review our financial performance and discuss our full year outlook.", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Although Q1 is the quarter with the lowest sales volume we are pleased with the results as Jim said.  On a year-over-year basis we achieved double digit sales growth for the quarter and reduced our per store inventory levels for the sixth consecutive quarter.  We believe this continues to validate the resiliency of our business model as we work through these tough economic times.", "For the first quarter ended March 28th, 2009 sales were $650 million and net income was $470,000 or $0.01 per diluted share.  The LIFO provision was approximately $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2009 and $0.04 in the first quarter of 2008.  Total comp store sales in the period increased 4.2% and non-comp sales were approximately $49.7 million or 7.6% of sales.", "Comp transaction count increased 5.8% and we are pleased that we continue to drive footsteps into the store.  The average comp ticket decreased 1.5% resulting from the softness in the sale of large ticket items.  Although the consumer is making more frequent trips to the store for their essentials we believe they are not adding non-essential purchases to their basket.  I\u2019ll go into a little more detail on some of the other sales drives and trends.", "Our stores are not open on Easter and with the Easter shift to April this year we had an additional comp store day in the first quarter.  We estimate that this resulted in an increase to comp store sales of approximately 160 basis points.  Our core consumable, usable and edible categories including livestock and pet supplies and feed continued to be the key drivers of the business.", "It\u2019s important to note that we estimate that inflation which is prevalent in these categories increased comp sales by approximately five to six percentage points.  I\u2019ll further address inflation impact in a moment.  Overall weather did not play a significant factor on a year-over-year comparable basis.", "Recycling a negative comp from the first quarter of 2008 which resulted from extremely favorable weather conditions in 2007 this year the year-over-year comparisons were much more normalized although there was some variability on a regional basis.  While January is colder in most regions February was a few degrees warmer which can negatively impact our sales.", "However there was some storm activity in February that favorably impacted sales in the Northeast and upper Midwest regions where comp sales were the strongest.  Additionally although March was slightly warmer than the prior year in the same regions the anticipation of an early spring was tempered by periodic cold snaps throughout these regions.", "Comp sales in our Del\u2019s stores were lower than chain average as the Northwest suffered through some extremely cold temperatures which hampered spring sales.  Overall we were pleased with Del\u2019s gross margin improvement and their ability to exceed plans under less than favorable climatic conditions.  Jim will discuss Del\u2019s in more detail later in the call.", "Comp sales were the weakest in the Southeast resulting from soft big ticket sales as we entered the spring selling season combined with the persistent weakness in the Florida economy.  Turning to gross margin compared to the prior year quarter we experienced an increase of approximately 40 basis points.  Lower freight expense compared to the prior year was the primary driver of this improvement.", "As we had anticipated we began to realize the favorable impact of fuel price decreases over the last several months that were capitalized as part of our inventory costs.  Additionally we are seeing some of the benefits of our transportation cost savings initiatives as Jim discussed earlier.  Our LIFO provision was essentially flat with last year at approximately $2.8 million.  This allowed us to slightly leverage this expense on the higher sales we achieved during the quarter.", "Before turning to SG&A let me comment on the inflationary impact for the first quarter.  As I mentioned we estimate that inflation had a favorable impact on comp sales.  Despite deflation in several categories over the past several months we expected retail price increase in the first quarter of 2009 would still exceed the first quarter of 2008 which was not characterized by high inflation.", "The more significant inflation we experienced last year began to accelerate in the second quarter.  at the same time as we have discussed in the past we actively seek to manage inflation by maintaining our gross margin rate and per unit profit and we achieved this successfully during the quarter.", "We will start to see the year-over-year inflation impact moderate as we move forward in the year and I\u2019ll discuss this more during my comments on our outlook for the remainder of the year.  For the quarter SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 30.7% of sales a 10 basis point improvement over the prior quarter.  We are pleased with the SG&A leverage we achieved especially in our lowest sales volume quarter.", "The main driver was leveraging our advertising costs as we focused more of our marketing effort on circulars and direct mail and less on television media.  As Jim mentioned we have found that our focus on driving gross margin dollars net of marketing expense has been effective.  The pre-opening expenses for new stores were approximately $2.9 million compared to $2.4 million in the prior year quarter.", "In the first quarter we opened 28 stores compared to 27 store openings last year.  Pre-opening expense per store was flat on a year-over-year basis.  We have strategically opened fewer new stores during January \u201909 than in past years since it is low sales volume period in between seasons.  By opening these stores later in the quarter pre-opening expense that normally would have been incurred in the previous December actually shifted to the first quarter this year.", "Further last year\u2019s openings included three Del\u2019s stores which require less pre-opening expense.  We also closed one Del\u2019s store in the quarter when we opted not to renew an expiring lease.  Turning to the balance sheet we continued to improve our inventory productivity.  At quarter end inventory levels per store were down approximately 6.9% that on top of an 8.2% decrease at the end of Q1 last year. ", "Our calculation is based on average cost of inventory and excludes in transit inventory and inventory held in unopened stores.  Annualized inventory turns for the quarter were 2.39 nearly a 20 basis point improvement over last year\u2019s first quarter.  We also had a slight increase in inventory financing to 47.8% up 80 basis points principally as a result of the improved turns.", "We believe that we have created a true business partner relationship with our vendors and believe that we are at the top of the vendors\u2019 list when it comes to allocation of merchandise if production limitations occur.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $18.9 million related principally to our new store opening program.  This is a decrease compared to last year\u2019s spend of $26.5 million which included the acquisition of two stores for $8.5 million.", "During the first quarter we continued to make purchases under our stock repurchase program.  We bought approximately 281,000 shares for $9.1 million or a cumulative total of approximately $213 million since the inception of the program in February of 2007.  The share repurchase program did not have a significant impact on EPS for the quarter.  We are extremely confident in our cash flow and liquidity position.", "Generally our peak borrowings will occur during the first quarter as we prepare for the busy spring season.  This quarter our peak borrowings were cut in half as we were below $75 million and our average borrowings were cut by two thirds from the prior year.  This provides us significant flexibility as our revolving credit facility is $350 million.", "We believe it is important to maintain our prudent balance sheet management in the current environment.  Turning to our outlook for the full year, with respect to our financial expectations for the full year 2009 as noted in today\u2019s press release we have confirmed our previous expectation for sales, comp sales and earnings per share.  ", "As a reminder we expect full year sales to range between $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion and full year comp sales ranging between a decrease of 1.5% and an increase of 1.5% and earnings per share to range between $2.58 and $2.74.  While we believe it is difficult to draw conclusions or extrapolate performance to the next three quarters based on our small get ready first quarter let me discuss a few of the underlying assumptions included in our estimate.", "With respect to sales consumer spending remains in line with our expectations outlined at the beginning of the year.  As I mentioned we continue to see our customers shopping our stores for a wide variety of functional nondiscretionary items that are very relevant to their lifestyle.  In April we are losing one selling day related to the Easter shift.  Early spring sales this month have also been softer than expected as cold weather has stalled sales of seasonal merchandise.", "However we expect overall that weather will be neutral for the quarter as the cold start of the spring season will be offset by more moisture in some areas of the country.  Consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year we have seen prices moderate in several key categories that were highly inflationary last year.  This will provide a difficult sales comparison particularly in the second and third quarters.", "With respect to margin we expect some margin pressures as we move forward in the year.  As I mentioned we had anticipated the inflationary impact experienced in Q1.  As we move forward during the year we do not expect the inflation tailwinds we experienced in 2008 or in Q1 of 2009 to repeat as cost have been more stable.", "We have demonstrated that we can successfully margin pressures with respect to the deflationary impacts due to sticker retail prices than we had originally anticipated at the beginning of the year.  We expect the firmness in the retail prices will buy us the opportunity to realize the beneficial impact of cost reductions on our moving average inventory costing.", "Additionally freight and LIFO at our current projection levels could provide a favorable offset to any incremental margin pressures.  Fuel prices are running substantially below last year prices and as Jim mentioned we believe that our freight initiatives will continue to gain traction.  With respect to LIFO based on our expectations for year end inventory levels and mix we are currently estimating a full year LIFO provision of $14.1 million which is essentially in line with our original guidance of $15.7 million.", "We continue to project the LIFO provision by ongoing cost reductions and concessions in several of the key product categories.  We expect this given that our mix continues to shift to fresh fast turning goods especially in light of our 20 to 50 in stock merchandise initiative and as we continue to clear merchandise.", "Also as we expand our store base we will have a net increase in aggregate total inventory.  This results in adding merchandise that has higher indices in the current company average and therefore a higher LIFO provision even as inflation moderates.  Let me remind you that provides us the opportunity to realize a substantial income tax deferral.", "We were pleased with our SG&A leverage in the first quarter.  As we indicated in our original guidance SG&A leverage will be difficult on a low comp sales increase especially as we cycle some of our cost saving initiatives implemented last year.", "However as I mentioned we believe the more efficient advertising spend should provide us some benefit particularly in the spring selling season before we begin cycling some of the shifts we implemented for the fall and winter 2008 season.", "Overall we believe if our sales are somewhat softer and/or we experience gross margin pressure we will be able to offset this through the related freight and LIFO benefits and additional expense management levers that we are planning such as to reduce TV advertising spend in favor of more efficient direct marketing spend.  We continue to expect to open 70 to 80 new stores this year although we now expect our openings in the first and second halves of the year will be split evenly.", "We have not changed our expectations that cap ex will range between $85 million and $95 million.  Overall we believe our ability to execute and serve the functional needs of the out here customer will be the key differentiators as we manage through the remainder of the year.  With that I\u2019ll turn the call back to Jim.", "James F. Wright ", "As I mentioned earlier we\u2019ll continue to differentiate our business in executing our retail strategy to win in the current environment and beyond.  At the same time we believe we are well positioned to react quickly should any changes in consumer buying patterns occur.  That said we\u2019re enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead for our company.  As you know our merchandise mix is the cornerstone of our business.", "We continue to provide our customers with basic and key items that support their lifestyle.  As previously mentioned we\u2019ve intensified the assortment and promotion of our CUE categories.  We continue to see an increasing trend towards grow it yourself hobbies like gardening and patch farming and we\u2019ve adjusted our merchandising plans accordingly.  The customer is spending more time attending to their gardens for personal consumption.", "We expand the depth and breadth of spring seasonal goods by adding more seed packets and vegetable plants and tillers to our store assortment.  Additionally we expect consumers will continue to defer big ticket items a trend that we began to see nearly three years ago.  Accordingly we\u2019ve shifted our focus to meet our customers\u2019 growing replacement part needs as they are increasing the repair and maintenance of their existing equipment.  We\u2019ve been tightly managing inventory levels on many big ticket items by narrowing the assortment while simultaneously ensuring that we have the depth to support peak season demand.", "We\u2019re also pleased with our refined marketing strategy.  The marketing team has stepped up to the challenge to do more with less as we adjust our advertising dollars to focus more on or CRM program.  We continue to reinforce the value proposition and our position as the authority on the rural lifestyle.  Additionally we are leveraging our advertising to drive repeat business and customer loyalty efficiently.", "In Q1 we generated significant savings from our advertising expense and we expect this trend to continue.  This is primarily the result of shifting ad spend away from television towards more direct marketing which allows us to offer the right products to the right customer at the right time.  Also we\u2019ve improved the look and shoppability of our print ads.  I\u2019m also very pleased with the continued improvement in our customer loyalty scores.", "While we currently rank in the top quartile of hard land retailers we are committed to further strengthening the bond that we have earned with our customers.  With respect to new stores we made a few changes that have generated increased sales earlier in the life of new stores.  We have reduced the timing gap between soft opening and grand opening.  Previously we had scheduled most of our grand openings to be during the peak season of selling weeks.", "Initially it appears that this change has driven stronger out of the gate sales at many of our new stores.  We\u2019ve also developed new grand opening print ads to introduce a broad merchandise assortment for greater impact.  As you are aware we held our store managers meeting in Nashville last month which provides our vendors with the opportunity to showcase their products and discuss their products with our store managers.", "We also held our first ever Vendor Conference in Asia last week.  In the current environment we find that it\u2019s more important than ever to ensure that we consistently work with our vendors to quickly translate the benefit of their decreased raw material costs for our mutual end users resulting in win/win solutions which ultimately drive the best outcomes for our vendors, ourselves and our shareholders.", "As we previously stated we view 2009 as another year of learning for Del\u2019s and we continue to closely monitor our progress.  That said we are continuing to better position this business.  This began several quarters ago when we initiated an organizational shift by aligning the merchandise and store operations under Greg and Stan respectively.  We refocused the product categories in which Del\u2019s has historically been most successful and have added only modest line extensions.", "The stores are well staffed, energized and we are ready for the upcoming spring selling season.  Before we turn the call over to questions I\u2019d like to reiterate that we have a very solid capital structure, a very strong balance sheet, we\u2019re generating significant cash flow from operations and have minimal debt.", "Though we continue to be conservative and anticipate persistent challenges in the macro environment in the near term we remain a growth company and we expect Tractor Supply Company will continue to deliver on our expectations to win both now and in the future.  This concludes our prepared remarks.  Operator, we\u2019d like to now open the call for questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Jim or Tony when you were commenting on the April sales trends, can you determine if the weakness is due to a smaller contribution from inflation that we\u2019re beginning to see or is it related more to traffic?", "James F. Wright ", "It\u2019s really weather.  When we look at our business in the month of April by day and by region the ground moisture first of all with the exception of Texas is very, very good and we have a combination of a nice weather on a Friday or weekend we do see a response in the business and a response frankly in mowers.  But Dan we simply have not had consistently spring like weather across most of the chain.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "That would be impacting traffic I would assume and not the ticket size?", "James F. Wright ", "No actually traffic, while not as robust perhaps as Q1 has been much better than the average ticket.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "I guess I\u2019m a bit confused then.  At what point during the period will the inflation benefit, the same store sales, begin to taper off?", "James F. Wright ", "Most of our inflation benefit last year came to us late Q2 and then through 3 and 4.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "One other question related to sales, you had noted that consumers are shifting away from style to focus on value and from wants to needs.  I\u2019m curious as to what those implications are for your apparel business which I know you\u2019ve been expanding the last couple years.", "James F. Wright ", "The good news is that very few people ever state that we have any style in our apparel or very much of it.  The vast majority of our business in really Q3, 4 and it\u2019s heavyweight outerwear.  Our boots are principally work boots and it\u2019s very much a replacement business as it is an aspirational business.  I see frankly very little risk in the clothing business.  If consumers do trade down to our private brands, that\u2019s fine.  We maintain equal gross margin dollars per unit.", "It\u2019d be obviously soft on a comp store sales side but will weigh on the margin side, Dan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jack Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company.", "Jack Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company", "I just want to go back to the inflation question for a minute.  Tony, did you say that you thought you had a 500 or a 600 basis points inflation in those consumable related categories?  Is that what you said earlier?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Jack Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company", "So help us scale this a little bit.  When you\u2019re talking about those categories in particular that are inflation impacted what percent of the mix were we talking about in the quarter?  And then on a related note given the fact that you saw some deflation or the beginning of deflation in other categories, if you look at the mix as a whole, how much do you think the comp was impacted by inflation?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Let me correct the question as you stated.  Overall we were looking at a 500 to 600 basis point increase not necessarily specific to those categories.  Directionally we see that as far as quantifying between the categories we wouldn\u2019t provide that level of detail because again it\u2019s really just an estimate trying to look at the retail prices and what the increases are year-over-year and there\u2019s obviously a lot of factors that go into that, not just inflation.", "Again we want to keep it more at a higher level.  Directionally we feel that year-over-year we understood that based on the inflationary impact in the prices throughout 2008 we knew that we had a significant increase in the first quarter and that will continue to moderate as we move through the year when we really go up against comparable numbers that had significant inflation in it.", "Jack Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company", "So the 500 to 600 is versus the total company comp?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Correct.", "Jack Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company", "On the transaction count, obviously a pretty big number, best in about two years I guess.  Given the calendar was Easter much of a factor in that and also how do you think traffic should progress as you move throughout the year given these other factors?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "If you want to break down to just generally on the 160 basis point impact on Easter about 140 would be attributable to the transaction side and 20 basis points attributable to the average ticket.  So that\u2019s how it would break down.  Again we would anticipate to maintain relatively firm traffic patterns and that has been consistent over the last couple quarters.", "It really truly is driven by the consumer and trying to satisfy their basic needs, continues to drive footsteps into the store.  We\u2019re looking forward to a continued increase in traffic.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "What was the inflation benefit last year in the first quarter?  I know you said it wasn\u2019t much but was it 1% to 2%?  Is that a fair estimate?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "I would say it ran in that range and probably more the 2% to 3% range last year.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Can you quantify the fuel impact benefit to gross margin in the first quarter?  Was it somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 basis points or so?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Of the freight increase we attribute about 70% of it related to fuel.  So you can break it down that way.  We had just total 40 basis points so I\u2019d say about 30 basis points related to the fuel increase.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "On the ad spend, I think last year advertising was just under 2% of sales.  It improved by about 24 basis points year over.  Can we expect a similar level of improvement this year in terms of the basis point improvement given what you guys are doing on the ad front?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "I would think throughout the year, in particular in Q2 we anticipate a similar run rate.  As we move forward into the second half of the year we\u2019ll continue to assess the program and make sure that we are not trading off marketing dollars in lieu of driving sales.  But generally we do expect to have a leverage of marketing but probably not to that extent as we work through the remainder of the year.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "One last question, on the softer start to the spring seasonal business can you talk about our maybe break it down between the OPE business and the lower ticket lawn and garden?  Is it across the board or is it more weighted in one versus the other?", "James F. Wright ", "Again it is mostly in big tickets and mostly in riders, walk behind mowers, really the whole category of cutting grass is the vast majority of the weakness.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mitch Kaiser \u2013 Piper Jaffray.", "Mitch Kaiser \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Could you talk a little bit on the food deflation or the deflation, what impact do you think that might have on transaction?  Because I know transaction becomes bigger in the second quarter relative to the first.  What should we be thinking about there on average transaction size in the second quarter?", "James F. Wright ", "With regard to feed and pet food?", "Mitch Kaiser \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Yes.", "James F. Wright ", "The closer we buy to the commodity which would be for example large animal feed, we\u2019re much more closely linked in our purchasing agreements to commodities that across are coming down and that retail is somewhat sticky.  On the pet food side it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag with the brands attempting to hold costs and as a result retails are staying and there\u2019s another tier of brands where across are beginning to come down.", "Retails again seem to be fairly sticky and generally because private brand is pegged to the national brands, private brand retails are staying a little stickier than private brand costs.  Is that correct, Greg?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Yes.", "James F. Wright ", "I would not to suspect to see a lot of ticket inflation on food and feed and the good news is that we continue to gain unit share in those categories.", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "As far as the average ticket goes, as we move into Q2 I would suspect that the sale or the softness in large ticket items would probably be more impactful than the inflation/deflation impact.  Since we have obviously the riders are a large portion of the sales and they\u2019re a large unit ticket.  That will have an impact.", "Mitch Kaiser \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "So you\u2019re not seeing the benefits of DIY then that people are maybe foregoing lawn service care and doing it on their own?  That benefit hasn\u2019t really come through yet I guess at this point?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Relative to riding lawn mower sales, not necessarily.  Obviously it has a significant impact when it comes to the repair and maintenance of those items which again tend to be a much higher gross margin category for us.", "Mitch Kaiser \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "I know you did a recap on the lawn and garden area.  Could you talk a little bit about the results that you\u2019re seeing there?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "We are very pleased with the set this year and we\u2019ve had a tremendous amount of learnings about our customer particularly in the categories that Jim mentioned in his comments about them wanting to grow their own foods and really tend to their own property.", "It\u2019s a little early right now for us to draw any conclusions on all of OPE but when we redirected the business and decided that other parts of the outdoor power equipment category could play a larger role this year, i.e., maintenance, the parts business, push more blowers and other types of categories, we\u2019ve been very pleased with those initial results.  A little disappointed as Tony mentioned and Jim mentioned on the rider category at this point.", "We have confidence that we\u2019ve got it planned correctly and it\u2019s just a matter of time.  ", "We need a little weather, that\u2019s all we need.", "Mitch Kaiser \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Lastly, I know there\u2019s some change in legislation or tax credits associated with alternative heating an I know this was a very strong category for you last year and often had some stock outs and back orders.  Could you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing or how you think you\u2019re positioned for the alternative heating category especially in light of these tax credits that might be coming through?", "James F. Wright ", "Obviously the tax credits as they materialize and get communicated would be a benefit.  We expect that the full year will not be too much unlike last year although the timing of that business is likely to change.  Last year you recall we accelerated normal Q4 business into Q3.  Then we got into Q4 and we in the industry had sporadic out of stocks on both stoves and fuel.", "The consumer exited last year saying boy there\u2019s a shortage of both the whole goods and the fuel, perhaps we ought to buy earlier.  Bear in mind that as the consumer went into the season last year they were looking at alternative heating being much, much cheaper than electrical, natural gas and in our case most importantly propane and fuel oil.", "So to a degree we are expecting some moderation demand as it is unlikely that we\u2019ll see fuel oil and propane prices a year ago.  That said we think that the fact that we\u2019ll be in stock during actual peak season will probably offset that but we will shift from Q3 to Q4.  ", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "One follow up on that will be the essence of the pellet business, the fuel actually for the units.  Because we had such increase last year in the installed base we believe there is still room for us to grow in fulfilling the needs of that customer as it comes to the fuel itself.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Lawrence \u2013 Morgan Keegan.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Greg would you comment a little bit to take it one step further on lawn and garden.  I know a lot of those products you just sort of reset and brought in to the category.  Was some of those products that you\u2019ve been selling for a long time still that have seen some increase because of the reset and the way that you put them together in that front left part of the store?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "You are correct.  By putting that together in one area to create a destination in the store and it has paid off very, very well for us.  ", "John Lawrence \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "If you take that obviously as you look at things down the road, other categories, other parts of the stores do you think maybe you can play that again?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "I would tell you that we have plans to do things similarly as we move forward yes, John you are absolutely correct.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "The last question, any comments Jim on the labor profile in the store? Economic environment, turnover down, attracting better talent, anything going on there?", "James F. Wright ", "Store turnover is actually modestly up but that is the fact that we are upgrading the team and we have a wonderful opportunity to higher some very strong talent so we\u2019re really in very, very good shape right now.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Matt Nemer \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "My first question is not to harp on the softness in April in some large ticket items but you sound very comfortable that this more of a weather impact than an economic impact and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve seen any consumer studies that confirm that or is there any chance that it is potentially the other way around?", "James F. Wright ", "I certainly couldn\u2019t rule that out but the greatest data we have is the response we see when we get a bright sunny warm day.  Matt, it is very, very significant.  We can see our business move several, several points of comp just due to the fact that we have a combination \u2013 it\u2019s very wet, everyplace but Texas and as soon as we get a sunny day when people are out in their yards and they\u2019re out shopping we see an immediate pickup.  So, while we realize that there is certainly a persistent big ticket problems for all the reasons that we all understand, we think that because that has been the case for a while now and certainly recycling that, that at this point in time we believe it is predominately the weather.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Then secondly, in terms of the OPE category, what are you forecasting this year in terms of year-over-year I guess it would probably be a decline, maybe slight growth, just what is the industry saying this year?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "That\u2019s a real interesting question and Matt I don\u2019t think there is any one real answer.  The industry OPEI has said that shipments, and I\u2019ll refer to that are going to be down double digit.  So, taking that in light I am sure that many retailers have planned their business accordingly.  We went through a real rationalization of skews, we looked at our store base, we looked at the mix of our skews and we feel still very comfortable that we have a very compelling offer.  ", "We\u2019ve assorted it by store and it\u2019s really, I agree with Jim, this is a matter of when the weather breaks and we believe it will be shortly and I think we\u2019re well positioned.  So, OPEI data would tell you that it\u2019s going to be tough.  I guess we\u2019re betting against the odds a little bit.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "I guess just digging a little deeper that does that mean you\u2019re going to have your inventory in that category will still be down year-over-year but not down as much as double digits?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "We have planned the inventory down to last year.  I can\u2019t go any further than that to tell you but its appropriate to our sales potential that we believe is out there for us.  ", "James F. Wright ", "Also, we\u2019ve narrowed the line so we have fewer choices of riders that allows us to have more depth so we can be in stock at the price points that have proven to be most important.  Again, this is where we\u2019re sorted this year not just by region but by store based upon their two year history by future benefit price point.  The other thing to recall is that riders have over the last really four years now have become a less significant portion of our business and the plan that we shared, the data that we used in our planning which we have shared with you all is that a good rider year would be beneficial to our results but we don\u2019t need one to achieve our objectives.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Part of the narrowed line, it sounds like from something you said earlier that there will be more push mowers, more sort of accessories and parts and perhaps that takes your ticket down in the category this year versus last year?", "James F. Wright ", "Within the category yes but, bear in mind we have a $45 ticket average so every string trimmer on average is double that. So, as we can gain share in walks, in string trimmers, blowers, we\u2019ve already had a very good tiller season, I expect more of that up North year, we have the opportunity to offset many of the sales dollars but most significantly the margin dollars.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Then lastly, in terms of the price moderation that you\u2019ve talked about, can you get more specific on which categories are starting to moderate?  It sounds like it\u2019s potentially not the feed and the pet food categories from what you said earlier?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "When we look at the three main categories, when you look at the grain prices, we look at oil and we look at steel, we\u2019ve already experienced a significant decrease in those raw material prices.  So, it\u2019s a matter relative to each one of those categories and how they impact our merchandise categories as we work with the vendors for us to realize those savings as well.  ", "So, we believe that we have worked through a lot of the price decreases and again, as we relate back to some of our comments that we feel that the retail price has been sticky in many of the categories to the extent that as we receive those cost reductions which we believe has already been experienced by many of the vendors and manufacturers in the raw materials, as we receive those prices decreases and they work through our average costs, we\u2019ll be able to maintain reasonable margins during that time period.", "So, we think obviously it\u2019s our responsibility to work through that.  It\u2019s part of our business to manage the margins and we think that we\u2019ve been successful and that we have seen a stabilization of the prices over the last couple of months.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Of those three in response to another question that was asked earlier it sounds like on the pet food side specifically maybe you haven\u2019t seen as much of a decrease as you\u2019d like?", "James F. Wright ", "We have not seen as much of a decrease as we would expect, that would be correct.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphery.", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphery", "Just a question going back to the inflation impact on the comp, you had said it was 500 or 600 bips, I guess does that mean then that I guess ex that then the average transaction size was really down about 8% coming on a FIFO basis year-to-year?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "When you say the average?", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphery", "You said the average basket size was down a couple of points earlier.  If you ex\u2019d out the impact of inflation as a positive influence there in terms of just taking price out of the equation mean that the basket size would be much less?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Right.  You would allocate inflation more to the average ticket.  It would have less of an impact on the transaction size, correct.", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphery", "So I guess what I\u2019m getting to is as inflation, the positive impact there begins to lesson as the quarter goes on, the second quarter and your traffic probably moderates certainly from the strong first quarter performance.  I guess the second quarter comp, although you didn\u2019t give the guidance, would be it looks like to me is going to be roughly offsetting what you did in the first quarter.  Is my logic I guess correct in that regard?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Not necessarily and obviously we don\u2019t give specific guidance to the second quarter.  We do agree that generally we will not have the tailwind that we\u2019ve had in the past in 2008.  However, as we look at it and we become focused on the margin rate and the margin per unit, as much as it may have an impact on the comp sales, we think what\u2019s critical is to drive the [inaudible] and that\u2019s where we feel that we\u2019ve been successful as we analyze categories that have already experienced that type of deflation.", "James F. Wright ", "Two things to remember, one in Q2 we\u2019re going to have a 100 basis point negative comp because Easter is in the quarter versus not being in the quarter last year and secondly, for the next three quarters with us reaffirming our revenue guidance, our projections are comps of -29 to a positive 80 basis points.  That\u2019s the range we are planning and yet we fully anticipate landing the EPS of $2.50 to $2.74 with that range of comp sales performance.", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphery", "Also could you talk a little bit about what the competition might be doing this spring in the mower business?  Is that having an impact different than expectations of any sort?", "James F. Wright ", "Frankly, thus far we have not seen any new tricks or any real strengthening by any of our competitors.  Obviously, the next six weeks will be the flurry of activity but we\u2019ve seen nothing out there that we think something else will win at our cost.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from [Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.]", "[Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.]", "If I could was the inflation impact in the first quarter the highest you\u2019ve seen in the cycle so far?  I think it was, it was higher than what you saw in the fourth quarter, correct?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "That\u2019s correct.  Generally for the year last year we were in the slightly above four range for the whole year and the fourth quarter was the highest quarter in 2008 that was sort of in the 4.5 to 5 range.  So yes.", "[Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.]", "Tony, what type of impact are you guys assuming in the full year comp plan in terms of inflation for that down 1.5 to plus 1.5?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "We really don\u2019t break out the inflation component when it comes to the comp sales.  Obviously we do sensitivities around that number and try to understand what the potential impact is and again, that\u2019s how we come up with the ranges but we have not disclosed any specific inflation guidance.", "[Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.]", "Is it fair to say it\u2019s not a negative number?  The impact for the full year?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Not necessarily but it\u2019s generally closer to the mid range of the comp.", "[Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.]", "Then on the expectations for your SG&A leverage plan over the balance of the year, what type of comp do you think you guys need to get leverage on SG&A over the balance of the year?", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Generally as we stated in the past we\u2019re still look at the 2 to 2.25 range.  I\u2019d like to sort of stay in the 2.5 but I think 2 to 2.25 potentially.  I think given the marketing spend we anticipate I think we have a good opportunity to leverage at that comp range.", "Operator", "", "There are no further questions.  Please continue with any closing comments.", "James F. Wright ", "Thank you all very much.  I\u2019m glad you\u2019re on this journey with us.  We are glad that we have confirmed the opportunity to open 1,800 stores.  Those of you who have known us for a long time recognize that we run the business against the long term opportunity.  We are diligent by the day, week and certainly by the quarter but we run the business to deliver value and continue to build the brand and relationship with our customers in this sort of aspirational lifestyle that we call this wonderful place out here.  We look forward to speaking to you next quarter. ", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference call for today.

Jim, please go ahead.", "James F. Wright", "Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm here today with Tony Crudele, our Chief Financial Officer, and Greg Sandfort, our President and Chief Merchandising Officer.", "Our second quarter and year-to-date results further underscore the structural changes that we have made to our business model over the last few years and our ability to navigate successfully through a challenging environment. We experienced another record quarter, a broad-based strength across the business. We grew sales by 11% with both traffic and ticket positive, and combined with margin improvement and SG&A leverage, earnings per share increased 18%.", "Now let me go into a bit more detail for the second quarter with respect to our merchandising margin expansion and efficiency initiatives.", "Our unique mix of merchandise drove our top line. We continue to focus on our core items and were quick to respond as the season evolved. Our consumable, usable and edible, or CUE categories, are core to the rural lifestyle. As a result, we've been able to pass through price increases while maintaining or gaining market share as we managed through this inflationary period. Consistent with prior quarters, these non-discretionary items drove traffic and sales across all eight regions. Our results reflect that we've become less reliant on seasonal big-ticket items.", "Seasonal weather was a headwind early in the quarter and drought conditions in the south affected approximately one-third of our store base. Accordingly, there was limited demand for outdoor power equipment and reduced demand for repair and maintenance sales in certain areas. However, we are pleased in regions where we experienced normalized weather patterns that our repair and maintenance performance was strong. For the south in particular, I'm proud of how our field and merchandising teams anticipated and responded to adverse conditions by shifting the product assortments swiftly towards items that drought-affected consumers need, such as animal feed and supplements, water storage and water movement products.", "We continue to make progress on our four key margin expansion initiatives. As planned, we transitioned and did the spring selling season smoothly. We continue to increase our strategic sourcing as we work with partners that provide us with great service quality and attractive pricing. We are delighted with the conversion of our customers to private brands. For example, our customers have continued to respond well to our 4 Health premium private brand dog food. We are beginning to see the positive effects from the initial rollout of our price optimization software.", "During the quarter, we continued to enhance service to our stores and to our customers. Our in-stock position is as strong as ever, we maintained our disciplined approach towards our [30/300 Program] which is focused on prioritizing inventory food of seasonally top 30 merchandise categories and the top 300 SKUs.", "Additionally, our distribution center team has done an outstanding job moving through the seasonal inventory despite less than ideal weather conditions and adjusting through the changes as we implement our new warehouse management system. During the quarter, we've decided to slow down the implementation of WMS and move the implementation for one distribution center from late this year to early 2012.", "The momentum we are experiencing in our business is a direct result of the plans we put in place and our team's ability to execute effectively. We've been very deliberate in tracking trends, anticipating needs and building relationships with our customers and business partners, and this has led to continuous growth for our business.", "I'd like to turn the call over to Tony to review financial results, discuss outlook, and then I'll be back to share a few additional comments.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Thanks, Jim; and good afternoon, everyone. We had another strong performance in our all-important second quarter. Our sales strength remains broad-based and we continue to increase our market share in many key merchandise categories.", "For the quarter ended June 25, 2011, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 10.6% to $1.18 billion, net income grew by 17.9% to $91.2 million or $1.23 per diluted share. Comp store sales increased 4.6% compared to last year's increase of 6.1%. We continue to drive same-store sale increases on top of strong prior-year performance. Non-comp sales were $63.8 million or approximately 5.4% of sales.", "As Jim alluded to, weather had a very pronounced impact on sales trends in the early part of the quarter as we experienced a late spring in the north and compared to an early spring in April last year. Although this resulted in a negative comp in April, our two-year comparison was still solidly positive. As spring began to break in May, we captured much of the pent-up demand and experienced a solid comp sales increase that continued into June. We are very pleased with the sales acceleration throughout the quarter.", "Comp transaction count increased 3.1%. This increase was on top of a 6.9% transaction increase last year. We continued to drive footsteps into the store with our CUE items, serving our customers' basic and functional needs, which resulted in more frequent trips to our stores. The trend in the average comp ticket continued to be positive at 1.5% versus last year's 0.7% decrease. Although we had a positive comp in big-ticket transactions, it was not a driver of the average ticket increase. The increase in average ticket was broadly distributed throughout our merchandise categories and was driven by inflation and by the mix within each transaction. We also continued to see acceleration of the comp for our new stores opened within the last four years as they ramped to maturity.", "We have continued to have broad-based sales strength with respect to both merchandise categories and geographic regions. The strong sales occurred across the entire country as each of our eight geographic regions experienced an increase in comp sales. Sales were the strongest in the northeast and north central regions as spring conditions drove seasonal sales. While the southwest suffered from an extended drought and was the weakest region, we were still pleased with the positive performance it delivered. As Jim noted, we did an excellent job in shifting the assortment to meet our customers' drought-related needs.", "The best-performing comp categories were our CUE products, principally animal and pet-related merchandise, and various seasonal lawn and garden categories. Although the drought in the southwest made sales within seasonal categories a challenge, we were better merchandised this year and had several product line expansions and new product line -- product introductions that drove the comp sales increase.", "For the quarter, we experienced a net estimated inflation impact of 220 basis points on top line sales. Inflation was most evident in livestock feed, agricultural fencing and lubricant categories as we saw cost increases in grains, steel and oil.", "Turning now to gross margin which increased 30 basis points to 34.1%. Direct product margin percent continued to improve as we have been making progress on our strategic gross margin initiatives which include improved strategic sourcing, private branding, price optimization and inventory management.", "Freight expense increased by 49 basis points over last year. This increase was driven by higher fuel cost than last year, costs associated with increased import activity of seasonal goods, and a mix shift to merchandise with higher freight costs.", "For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, was 21.9% of sales, which was a 30-basis-point improvement over the prior year's quarter. This improvement resulted principally from our sales growth. We leveraged occupancy for the sixth consecutive quarter while growing the store base by 7.9%. We leveraged several key SG&A categories including advertising, store support center and field management. Incentive compensation was consistent on a year-over-year basis and had a slight leveraging impact on SG&A.", "SG&A leverage was offset by approximately 10 basis points of deleverage of distribution center costs as a result of the increased product flow during the busy spring season and additional temporary labor costs as we implemented our new warehouse management system.", "The company's tax rate was 36.7% compared to 37.3% in Q2 last year. The tax rate was reduced by higher federal tax credits compared to the prior year. We anticipate that our full-year tax rate will be 36.8%.", "Turning to the balance sheet, at quarter-end we had $185.5 million in cash and investments compared to $181.1 million last year. During the second quarter, we ramped up our purchases under our stock repurchase program, acquiring approximately 1.15 million shares for $69.7 million. We estimate the impact of the stock repurchase program on the weighted average earnings per share over the quarter was approximately $0.01.", "Let me remind you that we increased our dividend by 71% this quarter and increased our share repurchase plan by $600 million. These levers will provide value to our shareholders, and at the same time, we remain solidly tracking to our yearend cash target.", "Inventory levels per store at quarter-end increased approximately 1.7%. We are very pleased with our inventory position as we enter the summer selling season and in light of the inflation that we experienced which is embedded in the inventory valuation. Year-to-date annualized inventory turns was 3.18 times, almost a 13-basis-point improvement over the same period last year.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $45.2 million compared to $24 million in last year's second quarter. This increase in capital spending related to approximately $18.5 million for the construction of our new distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky. We opened 16 stores and relocated one store in this quarter versus 19 stores opening in the prior-year second quarter.", "Turning to our outlook for the full year, as a result of our strong performance in the second quarter, we are increasing our financial expectations for the full year 2011. We expect net income to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.82 per diluted share compared to our Q1 guidance of $2.62 to $2.70 per diluted share. We expect full-year sales to range between $4.1 billion and $4.14 billion compared to our previous expectations of $4.0 billion to $4.11 billion. Correspondingly, same-store sales for the year are expected to increase 5% to 6% compared to our expectations of an increase of 3.5% to 5%.", "I'd like to quickly discuss a few of the underlying assumptions for the remainder of the year included in our full-year guidance. We believe the consumer will remain value-oriented and the CUE categories will continue to be sales drivers. The very positive sales trends that we experienced in June have continued into July. We are optimistic that the late start to spring and the moisture levels in the north in May, we will have an extended spring/summer season. We are very pleased with July sales and they have been factored into our forecasts.", "We expect that gross margin will continue to benefit from our initiatives. However, freight costs continue to run above our original planned levels as a result of higher fuel prices which will provide headwinds in the second half of the year. Even with the freight as a headwind, we believe that we can drive gross margin improvement in the back half by 20 to 30 basis points, similar to the first half of the year. We believe that weather will not have a significant impact on the second-half sales and we consider to be neutral year over year.", "We anticipate that we will continue to have inflationary pressures throughout the year; our full-year inflation assumption remains at 1% to 3%. We will begin to cycle against a less inflationary period in the fourth quarter, and thus, we anticipate that inflation will be closer to the lower end of the range and will have less of an impact on the top line in the fourth quarter than the second and third quarters. This inflation assumption is considered in our comp guidance and estimated average ticket.", "With respect to earnings growth in the second half, we had a very strong Q3 in 2010 and are [cycling] against the 5% comp and a 46% increase in profit. Also let me remind you that this is our 53rd week-year, which adds one week to our fourth quarter. Although we had a strong fourth quarter last year as a result of the additional week, we expect that, year over year, the earnings growth rate in each of Q3 and Q4 will be about the same as you model the back half of the year. We estimate the benefit of additional week to earnings is approximately $0.05 per share. Obviously, the additional week in 2011 will not recur in 2012, and that should be considered for your year-over-year earnings growth when modeling fiscal 2012.", "With respect to store growth and CapEx, we anticipate that we will be at the high end of our estimate of store growth and capital expenditures. We expect to open approximately 85 new stores and expect capital expenditures should range closer to the $160 million level as a result of the purchase of some leased stores. Year to date, we have acquired three stores for $7.7 million and anticipate a minimum of five to six additional purchases based on the opportunities that are under consideration. We will continue to opportunistically purchase leased stores when we are presented with the right of first refusal, when the economics are accretive to the income statement, and it improves our long-term returns on invested capital.", "To conclude, we are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter and are proud that our initiatives are driving top line and bottom line increase. We believe that we are well-positioned for another record year in both sales and earnings.", "Now I'd like to turn the call back to Jim.", "James F. Wright", "Great. Thanks, Tony.", "We are confident in our ability to meet our increased financial goals for the year. We believe that the momentum, the solid performance in the first half will carry into the second half. We've demonstrated that Tractor Supply is sustainably capable of continuing to build market share, profitably opening new stores, while increasing return on sales and ROIC.", "For a number of reasons, we believe our company is a one-of-a-kind retailer. We serve a unique niche. We have a very limited and fragmented competition. We have an experienced, energized and focused management team.", "At this time, we'd like to take a moment and thank Stan Ruta, my business partner and our Chief Operating Officer, for his dedication, commitment and leadership to Tractor Supply Company since 1994 when the company went public. As you may recall, earlier in the year we announced Stan's planned retirement. For the next six months, Stan will stay with us and handle special projects on assignment. We have effectively completed the smooth transition of his primary store operating responsibilities to Lee Downing who is now reporting to our President, Greg Sandfort.", "As our business continues to grow, we remain focused on shareholder return through our margin initiatives and balance sheet strength. We're in early stages of benefiting from price optimization, strategic sourcing, private brand development, and merchandise planning and allocation. We expect to exit the spring selling season cleanly despite a late start to the season, the drought, and are preparing for the fall. Our efforts in these areas are further enhancing our profitability and balance strength which is a key to our capital allocation strategy.", "We remain focused on investing in the business by expanding our footprint with new stores and distribution centers and improving technology and systems. At the same time, we have the financial flexibility to grow while continuing to return additional value to our shareholders. As Tony mentioned, we recently increased our buyback program allocation, and we are buying back 1.15 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $61. We've also increased our quarterly cash dividend last quarter -- or this quarter, by 71%. We believe these actions demonstrate our confidence in our business for the long term.", "Overall, we're delighted with our performance in the first half and will continue to investing in and executing against our plans. We remain nimble and look forward to an exciting second half of the year and beyond.", "Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks and would now like to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, if you have a question, you will need to press the star key followed by the digit 1. If your question has already been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star 2. Also, if you are using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the button.", "One moment. We'll take our first question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Thanks. Jim, I wanted to follow up on your comment about the warehouse management system implementation and, did I understand correctly, you'll be delaying that until the 2012? And maybe you could discuss some, maybe some of the challenges that you're seeing with that.", "James F. Wright", "Sure, Dan. What we did is we installed the system in our Waco, Texas distribution center and had intended to install one additional unit this year before we install it in our brand-new distribution center in Franklin, Tennessee. We had a little bit of slippage on time as we felt frankly it'd be best to shift our emphasis to the new distribution center in Franklin so that we do not have to bring the entire up to speed on the old system and then convert. So, simply -- nothing more than they have a few weeks of slippage and decision to minimize risk by bringing -- and cost, by focusing on the Franklin, Kentucky distribution center instead of one of the mature DCs.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. And then a question for Tony, I just want to make sure I understood the sales guidance for the balance of the year. So it sounds like you're expecting the third quarter comp sales growth to be stronger than the fourth quarter because the fourth quarter will have less of an inflation benefit, but then the reason why the EPS growth rate would be comparable for the two periods is the benefit of the extra week during the fourth quarter?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "That would be correct.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "And then finally, just, Jim, for you, I know in the past quarters you had talked about some of the smaller stores that you have opened which could potentially expand the potential number of Tractor Supply stores in the U.S. Could you remind us how many of the smaller stores are now operating and what kind of sales growth they're achieving compared to the traditional prototype?", "James F. Wright", "Yeah, Dan, I'd be delighted to. First, we anticipate to have a lot more information available probably first quarter of next year, more likely on our analyst meeting. We're spending a great deal of time now assessing the 48 contiguous states to kind of determine the ultimate opportunity. Having said that, we currently have 21 of those stores open and operating. They are, in aggregate, exceeding their sales target and their IRR target and return on sales targets. So we are frankly delighted with the performance of those stores. And beyond the in-aggregate performance, when we look at the over/under, there's very few that are under, and those that are, are very marginally under our initial sales performance. So it's very positive at this point in time.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, great. Well, thank you very much.", "James F. Wright", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from Vincent Sinisi with Bank of America.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Good afternoon and thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about price optimization. Jim, you mentioned toward the beginning of the call that you're starting to see some positive effects from the initiative. If you could just give a bit more discussion around what you've seen so far. You know, lubricants and paint were the first two categories to be analyzed. Just kind of the processes that you're going through, what you've seen there, and going forward, how that will be further rolled out.", "James F. Wright", "Sure. We are in a test and learn environment right now. I'll let Greg give a few more specifics.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yeah. Vince, hi. It's Greg.", "A couple of points to recognize with price optimization, it's a bit of a trial and error as you first start, and you mentioned several categories that we're now testing it in. What we are noticing is that there is price elasticity on the upside. It's also telling us and looking at the relationships of retails within category, within SKU base. And this is something that we could not have done with our past processes.", "So we believe what will happen over the term of this, and this will be a three to five-year rollout, is that our pricing across categories, across regions, districts and even within stores, will make a lot more sense to the consumer that's shopping in that particular market. We'll also find ways to drive some market share gains as well. We've noticed within one of the categories that, as we moved some price and made some adjustments, that we've actually seen gains in sales, and we believe that's also gaining market share because the units are increasing.", "So, so far, very, very good response, and we're learning a lot, and there's more to be said as we get further in the year.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up question, just turning to the inventory, obviously up [over the core], but you said that you're comfortable with levels as you're further going to the spring and summer months. Just any color in terms of if there's going to be any changes in your advertising within any of the categories? Or do you think it's really just a case of you had, as expected, a slower start to the quarter and should be working itself out continued going forward?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Vince, you just said it correctly, we do not anticipate any additional advertising as a need for [cleaning through] merchandise. Very comfortable with our inventory levels. As Jim mentioned earlier, we work the inventory levels day to day, week to week, we made the adjustments early when we saw that the business was not developing early enough in the quarter. And as we move into the second half of this year, we feel very strongly that, as we said, the summer season is going to extend a bit, particularly up in the north, and we're well-positioned with the correct inventories and we plan to capitalize on those sales opportunities.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks very much, Greg.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to Alan Rifkin with Barclays Capital.", "Helen Pan \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hi. This is actually Helen Pan calling in for Alan.", "I was wondering, how well is underlying demand holding up for your more discretionary products?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, I can speak to that for a moment. Discretionary products are not the mainstay of our business overall. We talk about CUE a lot, we talk about [30/300]. We did mention, and I'll reiterate, that the entire store is working today, all four corners. That would include the discretionary components as well. But I would tell you that we're seeing accelerated growth in the CUE and the [30/300]. We have not seen discretionary fall off to any great degree.", "James F. Wright", "Let me add a little bit to that. If we look at the northern parts of our company where the grass got green eventually and stayed green, even in the OPE category, we're actually pleased with the performance. Obviously as you get into the drought areas, that is not the case, but we really see more -- we see more relationship between weather and demand on big-ticket discretionary than we do anything coming from consumer sentiment.", "Helen Pan \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And just a follow-up question, did you see any increase in your private brand sales as a percentage of total sales?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes, we have. We're very pleased with how our private brand mix in cat foods is performing. I mentioned on last quarter's call about the left-hand side of our store and the emphasis we've had in growing our private brands there, [Jump Smart] and a few other, the products in our lawn and garden category. So we've been very pleased, very pleased with our performance, and we're growing market share in our brands.", "Helen Pan \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to Brent Rystrom with Feltl.", "Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company", "Hey, guys. Just a couple of quick questions. Is there any share buybacks embedded in your guidance?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Brent, this is Tony. No, there is not, only what was currently purchased in the first half of the year.", "Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company", "All right. And then just a quick question, a lot of the stores told me that, not a major thing, but just out of curiosity, your thoughts on it, that the [nursery shop] program that you put in place this year, a lot of issues as far as the wrong kind of plants for the climate. Does that make sense? That they were seeing the plants that were being sold in the climate area that's say a four rating, were getting plants that were more adaptable to say a six, or a tree that would grow in Georgia was trying to be sold in Illinois. Did you have issues with that?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Brent, this is Greg. Very little issues. It's still a test program. It's, yeah, it's possible that a store could have been mis-shipped by one of the local suppliers. But I'll be honest with you, overall we're very pleased with what we've seen in that performance, and we plan to expand on that if the results at [season-end] continue to be as they are.", "Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company", "Great. And the last question then, from an implementation of putting the hay in the stores. Is the hay going to be all on (inaudible) in all stores, or will it be (inaudible) in others?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yeah, a combination of both, Brent. It's really, it's a space issue that we've had to work through. You'll see some stores with hay in trailers, you know, in the side (inaudible) in the back. So it really is, it's on-demand and it's also in space.", "Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question, you may do so by pressing star 1.", "And your next question will come from David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Yeah, hi, guys. Good afternoon.", "James F. Wright", "Hi.", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Just have a couple of questions. One is, do you have any view of the hurricane season this year? Last year, as I recall, is somewhat subdued as far as the impact, say, the southeast and East Coast? Or is it --", "James F. Wright", "Yeah, this year, as last year, they're calling for above-average number of name storms. Obviously that didn't materialize last year, didn't come to fruition. So we really have no idea. And we have planned to emergency response in our plans the second half. So we if [allotted for] hurricanes, that would be somewhat accretive to our results.", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thanks, Jim. And Tony, the -- given what you know now with regard to the early results of price optimization, how would rank the three major factors, the private label, the sourcing and price optimization towards future contributors to gross margin?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yeah, I would say consistent to what we had forecasted earlier in the year and have had discussions on, that the price optimization will have -- will be most impactful early on, and we're very hopeful and optimistic that we'll see some benefit as we move into the second half. But it's mostly more as we move into 2012. The import private label, a little bit more of a slower impact and I think you'll see that more over the next year-and-a-half to two years as that process matures.", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thanks. And just lastly, with regard to e-commerce, anything happening there that changes your thinking about what you should be doing towards investment or otherwise?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I can speak to that. As we mentioned earlier, the 3C strategy which is content, commerce and community is the platform we're working from. We are diligent today in bringing the site back into focus against those three things. We believe that over time, and I'm saying this as the next 18 to 24 months, that we will have a more pronounced presence out there on the web with more products, because that's the content piece first, getting the content out there in front of the consumer, having availability for sale. And as we bring into play our ability to be able to transact with drop shipment and as we systematize the special order process, we believe there's nice upside in those two components. I'm just not ready to quantify what that will be yet.", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Hey, guys. Great first half. So, a couple -- three questions.", "The first question is, given the late spring and summer, it sounds like you're going to potentially hold that merchandise a little longer and the markdown cadence will come a little later. Do you push out fall receipts or you're just going to end up being a little heavy with both at some point later in the summer?", "James F. Wright", "Matt, we're not going to push out fall receipts, and we're really not heavy as we go on to the third quarter. As we said earlier, we made some maneuvering early on in the quarter as we saw business develop, and we took action. We have already moved through a lot of the categories where we felt we had excess inventories. We're very comfortable actually with where we are and what we believe we'll sell through the third quarter as we get into fourth. So, no great concerns here at this point.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. And then just broader, from a broader standpoint, as you're planning for the fall weather transition, could you just highlight, maybe give us a couple of highlights in terms of new products or any planogram changes, marketing cadence changes, just so we can be thinking about what to expect this fall?", "James F. Wright", "Well, I won't give you, you know, all of those things you've asked for; I'll give you a few tidbits though. We just reset our equine area, and the initial response from the consumer and our store people had been just terrific. Customer loves the new offerings, it's an area of the store on the far right-hand side that we've been working on for the last year-and-a-half. Very happy with the results of that.", "We continue to work our private brand mix throughout that store; I've talked about that earlier. You will see a heavier penetration as we hit the midrange of the third quarter with the receipts coming. And I'm very excited about seeing how the customer will respond to those values.", "And then again, the business of seasonal, we will transition cleanly, we will have our positioning for the early third and then holiday season in place this year. And I think not only are the assortments more tuned by the region, but I'm confident that the depth of inventory and the full of that inventory is going to be far superior to a year ago. So I believe we're going to see a nice performance there.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great. And then lastly, I know this is probably not a huge category for you, but there are some generic flea and tick medicines that are coming to market. I'm just wondering if you're planning on carrying them and what impact do you think that might have on the market.", "James F. Wright", "We have already several in our assortments. We do plan to pick up one of the new releases, and it may have some impact on the branded product. And we'll just have to wait and see how the customer responds.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great. Congrats again.", "James F. Wright", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Mark Miller with William Blair.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Hi, good afternoon. On the increase in the comp sales guidance by a point to 1.5 for the full year, how much of that was stronger sales in the back half of the second quarter versus the strong performance you're seeing thus far in the third quarter? And then to clarify, is there any change in what you would have thought for the fourth quarter previously?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Sure, Mark. This is Tony. When we look at the back half, we really look at the overall trends relative to the first half. There was no dramatic change in our planning for the back half. There might be a slight uptick in the third quarter and potentially we increase the fourth quarter as well. When I look at both first half and second half, obviously just from the overall guidance, you can calculate that the back half will be lower than the first half. We do expect both quarters to be positive with the stronger quarter being the third quarter.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair & Company", "It looks like on the incremental sales, that you're projecting a pretty strong drop-through rate to profitability. And my question, follow-up question, is, on the leveraged expense -- leveraged point for expenses for comps, do you expect that still to be in the 2.5% to 3% range, or is that also floating up a little bit? Thanks.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Generally it should remain in that 2.5%, 3% range, as we have it calculated. Again there is a productivity lift when it comes to the 53rd week in the fourth quarter that should have a positive impact.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Thanks. And just a final one, can you actually indicate what the private label percent is and what the year-to-year change is?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Last year it was approximately 22%, and then I think we just broke through 23%. So, got a point to point-and-a-half increase.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And moving on, we'll hear from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks a lot and good afternoon too. My question relates to pricing and inflation. Can you talk about what consumer acceptance has looked like? It seems like the pass-throughs have been pretty good. Has that been consistent across categories?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Matt, this is Greg. Yes, I would say that -- what we see is -- and we've talked about this before, how we -- we try to move ahead of the curve of price increase by starting today, let's say, price is moving, and we won't accept that increase for a period of time, and we'll start escalating, moving the price up to where we believe it needs to be once that movement in average cost -- movement in average cost has arrived within our inventories.", "Now, we watch closely, weekly. We monitor the amount of units that are being sold on all of our key categories, and as part of the pricing optimization flywheel, I guess, as well. And what I will tell you is that when we see any consumer resistant, we will course-correct. But at this point, we're very pleased to say that we're seeing, because of the way we operate, in stair-step, the consumer seems to be accepting and understanding in the pricing. And it's not always that prices are going to go up, by the way. Sometimes we can maintain and offset other places. But not seeing any real resistance at this point.", "Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And it sounds like based on your comments, that the third quarter I guess probably what you anticipate to be the peak in terms of year-on-year inflation, at this stage, I guess based on what we're seeing from vendors and on comparisons?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "That's correct. And one of the driving forces, that is not a large part of our business but it is out in other industries, is cotton. Cotton is probably the most extreme of the increases. We've been seeing some increases across the last several quarters within grain and within of course oil products, but cotton will be the one question mark as we get into the third quarter. And then things will start to -- drop back down, I believe.", "Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Thank you so very much.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to Simeon Gutman with Credit Suisse.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Jim, you had mentioned normalized weather I think in the prepared remarks. Can you talk about comps in the regions where the weather was normalized? And more importantly, the ticket, just to give a sense maybe some of the power equipment was selling there?", "James F. Wright", "Yeah, we will break it out by region, but what we looked at, as I guess I mentioned, kind of globally. Where we had good solid [late] with solid spring (inaudible) the grass was growing in the north central, northeast, we actually had a good unit increase in [Orion] lawnmowers and we had a nice mix, positive mix adjustment in [Orion] lawnmowers as well.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And I guess, is it safe to assume that ticket would be higher then as well if you're seeing higher units in that category --", "James F. Wright", "Actually our ticket was up across the chain.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Right. But in regions where I guess, call it normalized weather, not speaking specifically to any region, but kind of directionally.", "James F. Wright", "Right. That would be correct.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then second, I think in the press release, you mentioned on the expense side that there were some control on the occupancy and advertising lines. Can you talk about that, whether those controls were in place beforehand, meaning you're looking to sort of increase the leverage rate over those in response to the way the sales plan was developing in the quarter?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes. I mean -- this is Tony -- we quickly adjusted, when it came to the marketing plan and based on the sales trends early in the quarter. And what was good about our plan was that even as we pulled back on some of the expenditures to get an additional leverage, we continued to drive traffic and drove it right into the, really, the strong pent-up demand in the May and June timeframe. So we felt that not only did we get the traffic, but we were able to control that expenditure.", "We did look at a lot of the discretionary expenditures as we moved into the quarter and managed those as effectively as well when it comes to some of our general and administrative expenses.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, you may do so by pressing star 1 on your telephone keypad.", "Your next question will come from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yes, hi, good afternoon, and also congratulations on a good first half of the year.", "James F. Wright", "Thanks, Adam.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Understandably, you guys don't want to talk about the regionality too much, but just to help us sort of get a sense as to, I guess just looking at the ticket, you know, most specifically fell off mid to high single digits to a low single digit. What gives you the confidence that that would ramp going into the back half of the year given that comparisons remain in these levels? And then maybe if you could just, you know, what was impacted most by the weather and sort of how that played out between sales and gross margin. Because I know that the drought-related items have a higher margin but lower ticket, and then in the northeast it was sort of the opposite of that. So, just sort of how it all played out.", "James F. Wright", "Let me -- Greg and I will each answer a piece of that. You're absolutely right, that we responded well in the drought areas, I think supported that business very well. Our customers did lower ticket business at higher margins.", "I think what's most important to think about our business going into the second half is that the composition of our business and the composition of what drives big ticket is very different in the second half than it is in the first half. The first half is very dependent on the OPE category for ticket increase and the second half is much more dependent on heating, you know, stoves, furnaces, and while it's not what we'd declare a big-ticket item, it's a well above average ticket item, and that would be insulated outerwear. None of which we saw in the first half.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Right.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "In addition, moving to the fourth quarter and the -- course cattle aren't out and grazing, [the P] becomes more prevalent relative to the sales level as a percentage of sales. And obviously that's been a very strong chute for us. So generally, as we move into the back half of the year, we're less dependent on some of the outside variables that [will drive] the business.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Perfect. Thanks. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan.", "Mark Becks \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "It's actually Mark Becks on for Chris. First question, you called out weather as being a headwind. Did you quantify that or have any guess, suppose, how significant it was in the quarter?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "No, we did not provide any ranges and it'd be very difficult to do, as we try to quantify sort of the shift between the two months of April and May. The one thing that we have noticed is that it's digging up to a very late start it accelerated tremendously in May and it continued to be very strong in June, which gives us a lot of optimism that that season will continue longer than what we normally would consider as sort of that spring selling season. And obviously as we moved into July, that trend has continued. And so we feel very optimistic that we'll regain a lot of the sales that were lost because of the cold weather in April.", "Mark Becks \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Just looking at the big acceleration in the [May event], have you guys just never disclosed what the mix is by quarter -- or excuse me, by month, so, from April, May, June, what the split is there?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Relative to comp sales, no, we don't -- we give general direction, but we do not give specific comp trends on a month-to-month basis.", "Mark Becks \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "If we were to think about the mix being, say, 20, 35, 40, 45, does that seem realistic or -- in terms of percent to total?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Are you talking about the three months?", "Mark Becks \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Yes, so just looking at the contribution by month to the total, have we thought about April being 20%, May 35%, and June 45%, does that sound realistic?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "No.", "James F. Wright", "No. Does not.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "The norm is that generally April has the strongest sales per week, with May being second, June being the weakest, but June being a five-week month, generally there's a fairly equal distribution between April, May and June. So you can look at it that way in a normal weather environment, you would look at it sort of generally flat between the three months.", "Mark Becks \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And then just looking at how it sort of transpired this year, does that seem realistic based on how it was this year versus historicals?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "No. Clearly weighted to the back half.", "Mark Becks \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And at this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call over to management for any additional or concluding remarks.", "James F. Wright", "Great. Thank you very much.", "There's an old military saying that the greatest battle plan changes when the first shot is fired. If we look at Q2, our actual plan, mix of business, mix by region, that is certainly the case. I'm extremely proud of this team in their ability to anticipate the change in dynamics, to respond to those dynamics, and to land yet another record quarter. So, very pleased with that.", "A number of years ago, had we experienced the late spring and the drought, how we would not have reported the strikes that we just are pleased to report. That and the fact that we have a very good momentum going to the second half makes me feel very confident in the continued development and success of the company.", "I thank you all for being on this journey with us and look forward to talking to you at the end of Q3.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.  If anyone should require assistance during the call, please press star 0 on your touchtone phone.", "Please be advised that reproduction of this call in whole or in part is not permitted without prior written authorization of Tractor Supply Company.  And as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Jennifer Milan of FTI Consulting.  Please go ahead, Jennifer.", "Jennifer Milan", "Thank you, operator.  Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.

Lastly, Tractor Supply Company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed in this call.", "Now I'm pleased to introduced Jim Wright, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  Jim, please go ahead.", "Jim Wright", "Thank you, Jennifer.  Good afternoon, everyone.  I'm here today with Tony Crudele, our Chief Financial Officer, and Greg Sanfort, our President and Chief Merchandising Officer.", "We are delighted with our third quarter and year-to-date performance, with each quarter we've built on the momentum and continued to demonstrate that the structural changes we made to our business are contributing to our ability to grow and improve Tractor Supply Company.", "In the third quarter we experienced another period of broad-based strength and double-digit increases in both sales and profitability on top of record results recorded a year ago.  We also improved gross margin and leveraged SG&A costs.", "Now, to provide more detail on our performance during the quarter, we continued to drive top-line growth through unique merchandise mix, which enables us to serve our customers' everyday needs at a compelling value.  As expected our consumable, usable and edible, or [Q] categories remained key sales and traffic drivers.", "At the same time, we experienced increased demand for emergency response items such as generators and pumps related to Hurricane [Irene].  Although emergency response items are typically lower margin, they do drive footsteps to our stores, allowing us to strengthen relationships with existing customers and introduce new customers to our brand.  As drought conditions persisted in the southwest markets, we were nimble in refining our merchandise mix to support the changing needs of the customers in that region.", "While growing the top line, we remained focused on executing our four strategic margin initiatives.  This enabled us to manage merchandise margins despite some external headwinds.  While we experienced significant commodity inflation, we were able to provide compelling value on our [Q] items that are core to the rural lifestyle.  Once again we demonstrated our capacity to maintain margin dollars per unit while gaining market share during inflationary cycles.  We continue to invest in the business to support our stores, which has allowed us to better serve our customers.", "Our inventory management execution is simply the best that it's ever been, with a high in-stock levels and strong seasonal execution continuing to create a compelling shopping experience for our customers.  In addition, we've opened our new distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky as planned.  This is a new distribution center to facilitate our store growth in the northeast and the mid-south.  We are pleased with the smooth opening of the facility as well as our successful implementation of the warehouse management system.  We've already begun taking receipts at this new facility and expect to begin shipping product in December.", "Overall, the third quarter results further validate that we continue to gain traction from our strategic initiatives which collectively have strengthened the structural foundation of our business and our brand.  Tractor Supply Company is operating as a better, stronger and more sophisticated retailer than ever before.  We have the right plans, we have the right team in place, and we're executing well across the business.  We are sustainably gaining share in the market, and look forward to a strong close to 2011.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Tony to review our financial results and discuss our outlook.", "Tony Crudele", "Thanks, Jim; and good afternoon, everyone.  We had another very strong performance in our third quarter.  Our sales strength remains broad-based, and we continue to increase our market share in many key merchandise categories.  Although comp sales benefited in part from Hurricane Irene and from inflation, the overall underlying fundamental strength of our business is demonstrated by the significant increase in unit sales and transactions.", "For the quarter ended September 24, 2011, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 17.9% to $977.8 million, and net income grew by 43.1% to $42.7 million or $0.58 per diluted share.", "Comp store sales increased 11.5% compared to last year's increase of 5%.  We continue to drive same-store sales increase on top of a strong prior-year performance.  Non-comp sales were $53 million or approximately $5.5 million of sales.", "Comp transaction count increased for the 14th consecutive quarter by 5.9%, which was on top of a 6.3% transaction increase last year.  We continue to drive footsteps into the store with our [Q] items, serving our customers' basic and functional needs.  We also continue to gain customers through effective and targeted marketing.", "Additionally, we believe that we experienced an increase in customer acquisition as an indirect result of Hurricane preparedness and emergency response sales related to Hurricane Irene.  We estimate that approximately 90 basis points of the comp store sales increase resulted from emergency response sales.", "The trend in average comp ticket continued to be positive at 5.3% versus last year's 1.3% decrease.  We saw an increase in big ticket purchases consistent with the overall company comp increase.  We estimate that this increase in big ticket purchases drove 120 basis points of the overall comp sales increase, with approximately half attributed to hurricane-related big ticket sales.", "The increase in average ticket was broadly distributed throughout our merchandise categories and was driven by inflation as well as by mix.  We continue to experience broad-based sales strength with respect to both merchandise categories and geographic regions.  The strong sales occurred across the entire country as each of our eight geographic regions experienced a high single-digit increase in comp sales, or better.", "Sales were the strongest in the mid-Atlantic region, which benefited from an extended spring, and also hurricane-related sales.  While the southwest suffered from an extended drought and was the weakest region, we are still pleased with the positive performance as we did an excellent job shifting the assortment to meet our customers' drought-related needs.  Broad-based nature of the sales increase is also reinforced by the consistency of sales throughout the quarter as we experienced a double-digit comp increase in each of the months.", "The best-performing comp categories were our [Q] products, principally animal and pet-related merchandise, and additionally, emergency response and heating categories.  Over the quarter, inflation exceeded our forecast as we estimated that it contributed approximately 465 basis points to the top line sales.  Inflation was most evident in the livestock feed, agricultural fencing and lubricant categories as we saw cost increases in grain, steel and oil.", "Now turning to gross margin which increased by 25 basis points to 33.5% of sales.  Direct product margin percent improved as we continued to make progress on our four strategic gross margin initiatives.  We achieved this increase while overcoming headwinds from freight and the negative mix impact.  Additionally, the merchandising team did an excellent job managing gross margin during a highly inflationary period in many of the core products.", "Let me remind you that during inflationary times we experience pressure on margin rate and focus on driving margin dollars per unit.  As you can see from our results, we are very successful in managing gross margin dollars during the third quarter.", "Freight expense increased by 48 basis points over last year.  This increase was driven by higher fuel costs, costs associated with increased import activity of seasonal goods, and emergency response in this quarter.", "As an example, as part of our strategic sourcing initiative, import purchases in the quarter represented a little over 13% of our purchases, which is greater than 74% year-over-year increase.", "Overall, we are pleased with our gross margin performance while we continued to provide great values to our consumer.", "For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization, was 26.5% of sales, which was approximately 100 basis points of improvement from the prior year's quarter.  This improvement resulted principally from our sales growth.  We leveraged our key store expenses, payroll and occupancy.  We are pleased to have a leveraged occupancy for the seventh consecutive quarter while growing the store base by 8%.  Favorable leverage from store expenses was slightly offset by increased incentive compensation expense as our results were significantly above last year's performance and exceeded our original current-year plan.", "The company's tax rate was 36.7% compared to 37% in Q3 last year.  The tax rate was reduced by higher federal tax credits compared to the prior year.  We continue to anticipate that our full-year tax rate will be 36.7%.", "Turning to the balance sheet, at quarter-end, we had $118 million in cash and investments compared to $187 million last year.  We are tracking well towards our cash management targets and anticipate year-end cash balances to be in our target range of $100 million to $150 million.  The year-over-year reduction in the cash balance at the end of the third quarter resulted from our seasonal purchases and stock repurchases during the year as we returned value to our shareholders.", "During the third quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired approximately 805,000 shares for $49.2 million.  We believe that the volatility in the marketplace provided an opportunity to repurchase shares below our calculated intrinsic value, and we were pleased with how our approach worked under our 10b5-1 plan.  We estimate that there was minimal impact on EPS from the share repurchases in the quarter.", "Inventory levels per store at quarter-end increased approximately 1.6%.  We are pleased with our inventory position as we ended the fall/winter selling season, especially in light of the inflation that we experienced, which is embedded in the inventory valuation.  Year-to-date annualized inventory turns were 3.13 times, a 15-basis-point improvement over the same period last year.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $33.2 million compared to $30.2 million in last year's third quarter.  This increase in capital spending related to approximately $10.9 million for the construction of our new distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky compared to $8.2 million expended in the prior year for conveyor systems and equipment for two distribution centers.  We opened 12 stores, closed one store, and relocated another in the third quarter, versus nine openings in the prior-year's third quarter.", "Turning to our outlook for the full year.  As a result of our strong performance in the third quarter, we are increasing our financial expectations for the full year 2011.  We expect net income to be in the range of $2.85 to $2.89 per diluted share compared to our previous guidance of $2.75 to $2.82 per diluted share.", "We expect full-year sales to range between $4.15 billion and $4.17 billion compared to our previous expectations of $4.1 billion to $4.14 billion.  Correspondingly, same-store sales for the full year expected to increase 6.5% to 7% compared to our prior expectation for an increase of 5% to 6%.", "I'd like to quickly discuss a few of the underlying assumptions for the remainder of the including -- included in our full-year guidance.  Let me remind you that we are cycling against a 13.1% comp in the fourth quarter last year, and this is a 14-week quarter as part of our 53-week year.", "We estimate that the benefit of additional week to earnings will approximately be $0.05 to $0.06 per share.  Obviously, the additional week in 2011 will not recur in 2012, which should be considered in the year-over-year earnings growth when modeling fiscal year 2012.", "We believe that the consumer will remain value-oriented and that [Q] categories will continue to be the sales drivers.  We also recognize that consumer sentiment regarding the economy continues to be negative.  October sales to date have been very solid and are incorporated in our forecast.", "The early cool weather in the north has had a positive impact on sales as we transitioned to the fall winter selling season.  However, we expect weather trends to be slightly negative for the fourth quarter overall as November and December are projected to be slightly warmer than last year.", "We expect that gross margin will continue to benefit from our strategic initiatives.  However, freight costs continue to run above our original plan levels.  We do not expect that this variance will begin -- we expect that this variance will begin to moderate as we start to cycle fuel increases in Q4 last year.  Even with freight and mix as headwinds, we believe that we can drive gross margin improvement in the fourth quarter of approximately 10 to 20 basis points.", "We anticipate that we'll continue to have inflation in the fourth quarter.  Our full-year inflation assumption is 2% to 3%.  Although Q3 came in above our forecast, we will begin to cycle against less deflationary period in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate that inflation for the quarter will be in this range.  This inflation assumption is considered in our comp guidance.", "With respect to store growth and CapEx, we now expect that the full-year expenditures will be approximately $165 million.  We anticipate that we will exceed the high end of our original $160 million estimate for store growth and capital expenditures as a result of the acquisition of two of our lease stores originated in Q3 and a minimum of four additional purchases based on current commitments or intent to purchase.", "Year-to-date, we have acquired five stores for $14 million.  We will continue to opportunistically purchase lease stores where we are presented with the right of first refusal when the economics are accretive to the income statement and it improves our long-term return on invested capital.", "To conclude, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter and are proud that our strategic initiatives are driving top and bottom line increases.  We are well-positioned for another record year in both sales and earnings.", "Now I'd like to turn the call back to Jim.", "Jim Wright", "Great.  Thanks, Tony.", "As you heard us say before, we place a great deal of rigor around our long-term planning process.  The performance and the growth that we are delivering are reflective of this methodical approach, consistent execution and ability to capture value from our strategic initiatives.  We believe that we're only beginning to see the benefits of our actions, that the structural improvements that we made to the business will continue.", "As we look to the upcoming fall/winter holiday selling season, we remain confident that we have the right plans in place.  Our heating department looks just terrific.  We've recently introduced Redstone, our private label brand in the heating category.  We are pleased with the look and the feel of this brand.  As you know, our private brand strategy is key -- is a key initiative from a top-line margin and loyalty perspective, and we're excited about the opportunities for Redstone as well as our other private brands.", "As we look ahead, we believe that consumers in general remain cautious and we expect they'll continue to make needs basis, value-driven purchases.  We expect the holiday season to trend as it has for the last few years, with customers looking to buy functional everyday items.  With that in mind, we continue to develop and merchandise functional products at the best value possible.", "Now let me briefly review some of the additional merchandise and the marketing initiatives.  We've enhanced in-store presentation and product displays, and we've improved product content.  We continue to test and learn from a price optimization strategy and leverage the point of sale information.  We're also using marketing more effectively and efficiently to drive the business forward.  Through our CRM program and direct mail programs, we are capturing data that allows us to better understand our customers and their household needs.  We are very pleased that both are providing increased ROI on marketing and advertising spend.  We understand our niche very well and we are learning more about our customers each day.  As a result, we continue to refine our marketing efforts.", "Overall, we believe that we have considerable runway ahead of us as we continue to implement and gain traction on each of our strategic initiatives.  We are gaining share in the market, increasing sales and profits, and expanding our footprint in key regions.  The team is fully aligned, collaborative and passionate about what we all do.  As a result, our execution has never been better and is dramatically superior to what it was only a few years ago.  Our balance sheet is strong.  We look forward to completing another record year for Tractor Supply Company and building on the momentum in 2012 and the years ahead.", "Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks and would now like to open the call for questions.", "Q&A Session", "Operator", "Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, if you have a question, you'll need to press star 1.  If your question has already been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star 2.  Also if you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the buttons.  One moment please for the first question.", "And our first question comes from Alan Rifkin from Barclays.", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you very much.  Can you folks hear me?", "Jim Wright", "Yeah.", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hey, congratulations on a nice quarter.", "Jim Wright", "Thank you.", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays Capital", "A couple of questions if I may.  Jim, you said that ticket rose 120 basis points, 60 basis points driven by the hurricane.  I was wondering if you could please elaborate on the other 60 basis points of core comp increase that was driven by big ticket.  What specifically you saw there and what sustainability do you believe is behind that number.", "Greg Sandfort", "Hey, Alan, it's Greg.  Let me take the first one.", "No question that in the quarter, with the weather impacts of Hurricane Irene, we saw some big ticket improvement in generators, chainsaws, things that are larger ticket.  But we also saw, probably for the first time, the return of some of the other categories that we've been -- we have not seen for the last couple of years.  Our truck box and fuel-handling equipment categories, the heating category got off to a very good start early in the year which we did not have a year ago.", "And I would tell you that some of our other categories where we talked about big ticket, $350 and higher, have been, how would I say this, a quick start for the fall season, and we're pleased with it.  But it wasn't just the hurricane.  It has been, and we've been seeing some movement in big ticket, but very delighted that we're starting to see this consumer coming back.  Maybe we're getting toward a replacement cycle, I'm not sure.  But clearly, some of the big ticket products are starting to sell again.", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Greg, so despite your belief that the consumer remains cautious, I mean do you think that there is a sustainability on this part of the equation, since you said that these are trends that you haven't seen for a couple of years?", "Greg Sandfort", "It's hard to say.  One quarter would not give me the confidence that it's a trend just yet.  I think we'll answer that question as we get to fourth quarter.", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay.  And one more question if I may, and then I'll turn it over.  With respect to the opening of the Franklin DC, were there any costs associated with that opening in the quarter that were expensed that negative impacted your SG&A line?", "Tony Crudele", "Alan, this is Tony.  There was some expenses related, but it was not significant, and I would say the impact would be limited and it wouldn't be something that you would exclude it from your model.", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay.  Thank you both very much.", "Jim Wright", "Thank you.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Vincent Sinisi with Bank of America.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America", "Thanks very much for taking my question, and congratulations on another very nice quarter.", "Jim Wright", "Thank you.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America", "No problem.  I wanted to ask you guys, Jim, not too long ago you had come out and officially gave a new EBIT margin target, I believe it was over the next three to four years of 8.5% now.  Just wondering if any of your underlying assumptions have changed since you last had given an EBIT target in terms of the percentage contribution from each of the components.  I know that traditionally you guys have expected gross margin about 20 to 30 basis points a year.  If you can elaborate if anything fundamentally has changed, that'd be appreciated.", "Jim Wright", "Sure, Vinnie.  At this point in time, we would stick with 8.5% as our goal.  Historically we've talked about it would be driven principally by gross margin rate.  As we cycle through the inflation, and you've heard us talk many times about our capacity to maintain margin dollars per unit, I think we may see the EBIT driven equally now via margin dollar gain as well as a continuous gain in margin dollar rate, unless we begin to see a reversal of the inflation we're experiencing as we speak.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay, that's helpful.  And one follow-up if I can, as you continue to refine your marketing efforts, can you give any perspective in terms of what's giving you kind of the best bang for your buck?  Do you think that your strategies that are in place right now will remain, whichever, contemplate moving back into a TV type of advertising?  Do you have a sense for what's drawing the most new versus existing customers?", "Jim Wright", "Sure.  We're delighted with our ability to look into our customer profile and move them upwards in each of the seven segments we have and then begin to move them across segment towards, in each case, towards your higher-value consumer of the shops with increased frequency in shops across the broader market basket.", "With regard to television, our recent research has indicated that there is a significant number of consumers that we call aware non-shoppers.  They are aware of Tractor Supply, they may drive by our store, but their point of view is \"probably not as store for me.\"  We've had some focus groups with those customers, taking them through -- showing them an ad [sap] which is essentially a magazine ad, that describes in greater detail what our stores are all about.  And we've noticed a pretty significant opinion change in those customers' desire to perhaps give us a try.", "As a result of that learning, we are currently testing regional television in three markets, and then obviously using the adjacent markets and the rest of the company as a control group, and we'll be testing that TV advertising through the end of this year.  And its purpose is to -- is deliberately to target this aware non-shopping consumer.  They will never be our highest annual value as our best customers, but they do own pets, they do take care of their yards, and for them, we may be the most convenient outlet for those products.  So we are actually back on television after a three-year hiatus, but we are doing it very selectively against the highly targeted audience, and we're measuring the response.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay.  Thanks very much, Jim, and best of luck to you all in the fourth quarter.", "Jim Wright", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next question will come from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Hey, guys.  A couple of questions.  First, Tony, maybe how material was that incentive comp hit in the third quarter?  Can you give us maybe a basis-point impact or dollar impact?  That's the first question.", "And then the second question, the new store plan for the year, is that still the high end of 80 to 85?  And related to that, as we think out towards next year, just some early thinking about CapEx.  I know some of the DC stuff falls off, so I wanted to just get your thoughts on that.", "Tony Crudele", "Right.  Yeah, Peter, as far as the capital goes, we are targeted still at the 85-store range for this current year.  As we move into next year, we're going to focus a little bit more on the sales percentage increase.  As we open some of these smaller -- the small market stores, we may have a little bit more unit growth, but we are still targeting about the 8% sales growth.  So that should put us in somewhere between the 90 to 95-store range for 2012.", "And on the first question --", "Jim Wright", "Incentive comp.", "Tony Crudele", "The incentive comp, the range was around 30 basis points, you know, give or take a few.  A lot of it really had to do with the strong sales performance and was related to the store monthly sales bonus.  So, a strong performance by the stores and the incentive compensation followed.", "We believe that as we move through this year, we have been able to look in incentive compensation relative to the performance.  And as you move into the fourth quarter, I think we're well-positioned, given our performance year-to-date, based on our original forecast or original budgeting and performance compared to last year, and the booking of the incentive comps.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thanks, that's helpful.  And then maybe a follow up for Jim or Greg, just any early learnings you guys are seeing from the price optimization rollout that I guess started in June?  I know it's early, but just any initial thoughts on how that's starting to work out, and kind of the pace of getting that rolled out to all the categories that you have that planned for?", "Greg Sandfort", "Hey, Peter, it's Greg, I'll answer that one.  First of all, all the buyers in the company are on the plan now with at least one or more categories.  About 27% of all the company's categories and volume of those categories is now being managed on the Revionics system.  So we're starting to get a decent read now.  We're managing categories basically two ways: the gross margin to market share and then really maybe even a third way, combined of -- is a mix of both.", "I would tell you that we are learning a lot about our pricing rules and our correct pricing relationships between categories.  That's probably more of a more important learning that we've had.  Yeah, you change your price here in the category, what is the effect in some other products over here out of the sale ship and so on.", "And then I'd say last, and we're not ready to give any hard numbers to this just yet, but we are seeing an uptick in our gross margin performance due to this more up than down, I will say that.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "All right.  Terrific.  Thanks very much, guys.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Thanks.  Jim, a question about the smaller 12,000 square-foot stores, as I recall, there are about 23 of those now opened.  When you go through periods such as the third quarter with very robust comp store sales growth, are those smaller stores able to achieve the same type of gains as the company average?", "Jim Wright", "Sure.  Yeah, good question, Dan.  But when you think about the, I guess, the type of metric -- important metric is inventory turns, days average inventory on hand, and that would be a number that's very comparable to the full-size markets.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay.  And then a second question, I wanted to clarify your comments about during periods of especially high inflation, that you're focusing on gross margin dollars, not gross margin rate.  And I understand that.  But on the other hand, your margin rate did increase.  So, just wanted to confirm, are you able to pass through all 4 percentage points of inflation through, or did the company have to eat some of that increase?", "Jim Wright", "Well, we -- two things, two countervailing things.  One, there's mix of product, and our mix this quarter was actually margin-negative.  The four initiatives we discussed many times were -- all gained traction and they were margin-positive.  And then we had significant commodity inflation.  And that relates specifically to my comment that, as we manage high-velocity commodities the cost increases fairly quickly, while we delay that when we can, we then look at the marketplace and use our pricing power at the pace that allows us to maintain or gain market share.  That decision may compress margin rate, which it did in those categories during those quarter, but does allow us to maintain margin dollars per unit, or per bag if we're talking about feed.  So, those were the dynamics of margin this last -- in this last quarter, Dan.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Then just as a last question I had for, just for Greg, I believe you're now in the third year of the introduction of Nutrena and Purina.  You've talked in the past about the benefits in terms of driving more traffic to the stores and helping ticket size.  But now that we are in the third year of those initiatives, do those benefits begun to run out?", "Greg Sandfort", "Dan, it's Greg.  We're really in still year two, haven't eclipsed year three year.  And what we're still seeing, because we track this through our CRM database, which is 40-ish percent of the consumers that are out there shopping with us, that we still see new customers coming in because of those two brands, and we also see customers who were buying in other parts of the store but not buying feed now starting to buy feed from us.  So we're still very delighted with what this is still bringing to us.", "I must comment, remember, that branded feed is the top [slice] of the feed business.  It's not the major driver.  You've got a lot of commodity businesses under that and our own private brands, but it's an important piece because it completes the picture of the whole feed story for the consumer who is particularly interested in buying that branded feed.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Great.  Thank you.", "Operator", "And moving on to John Lawrence with Morgan Keegan.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Yeah, thanks.  Good afternoon, guys.", "Jim Wright", "Hi, John.", "Greg Sandfort", "Hi, John.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Greg, would you follow up a little bit and just talk a little bit about the private label portfolio.  Going into fourth quarter, it looks to me like in the store pretty good SKU additions in C.E,. Schmidt, obviously Jim mentioned Redstone.  Just give us a little sense of, are we seeing more SKU expansion going into the fourth?  And then I'll have a follow-up.", "Greg Sandfort", "You're right, John.  You've been out in the stores.  As I said in the call last quarter, we would start to see that influx in the third quarter and into fourth.  There's been substantial SKU additions across the store.  Heating is probably one of the more noticeable because it's new.  JobSmart is still expanding.  You saw C.E. Schmidt.  There's other categories, rowing and such.", "What I can tell you is that, you know, very pleased with what we're seeing initially on sales too.  So, yes, we have done exactly what you said.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Even the pink overalls?", "Greg Sandfort", "Yeah, even the pink -- believe it or not, John, those sell.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "I understand.", "Greg Sandfort", "There's a customer for it.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Secondly, could you talk just a little bit about -- following up on Dan's question regarding the smaller footprint.  Anything there about as far as just the, I guess, the challenges of getting some of that -- the turns, Jim, as far as -- I know the breadth of some of that product is a little less than -- that's the idea of stocking that store.  Could you just go one step further, and the ability to stock that store when -- high-turn categories?", "Jim Wright", "Sure.  As we reduced the inventory, and I think you've heard us say in the past, that a full-sized store opens with about $670,000 of inventory cost.  Small box will open at close to $500,000.  We expect the full-size store to open at $3 million.  We expect the smaller market store to open around $2 million.  So it has a little more than two-thirds the inventory with an expectation of two-thirds of sales.  And we do first work on narrowing breadth.  For example, we have a category where we offer good, better, best.  In the smaller market, we may offer only the good/better, or the better/best.", "We, to the degree it's possible, do not reduce depth in any of the high-velocity categories.  And bear in mind that we do replenish our stores at least weekly, including the small stores.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Right, thanks.  And the last question, Greg, is, you mentioned some of the high-ticket items you're starting to see that customer come back.  Does that bode well, obviously going into spring of next year, back to the more season, from your standpoint?", "Greg Sandfort", "John, if it continues, yes, it would bode well for us.  But again, I said this is really the first quarter that we've seen this happen.  I'd like to get another quarter under our belt to be able to speak to it and say, \"Listen, it looks like they're back and they're starting to buy again.\"  So it's still a little early.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Thanks, guys.  Congratulations.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Jim Wright", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.", "Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Hey, good afternoon.  Also pass down my congratulations on the good results.", "Jim Wright", "Thank you.", "Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Tony, I had a question for you on some of the detail around gross margin.  When you said that -- it sounds like freight expense, and there were some other things, was a 48-basis-point negative impact, did that also include the negative mix impact from the hurricane-related items?", "Tony Crudele", "The freight relates to -- the 48 basis points relate to freight.  Obviously that would include movement of some of the big ticket items such as generators.  In addition to that, we did have a negative mix impact, and that is not included in the 48 basis points.", "Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay.  Could you give us a ballpark of what that negative impact for mix was?", "Tony Crudele", "Yeah, it, again, it seems like I always default back to around a 30-basis-point range, but again, that mix variance or negative mix impact was in that range as well.", "Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay, all right, that's helpful.  Thank you.  And I appreciate some of the feedback you've already provided on the price optimization initiatives.  I was just curious here, as we've seen the last couple of months with consumer sentiment dropping off, does that change your outlook on how you may be able to drive gross margin expansion?  Obviously maybe in some categories it's a little more difficult to adjust price as consumers are getting a little more challenged from a spending front.", "Greg Sandfort", "Peter, this is Greg.  It does -- it's taken in consideration, as we make adjustment and we watch and monitor it very, very closely, I would tell you that thus far we haven't made any moves where we've seen a dramatic drop-off from the consumer.  We're very cautious, it's a slow ratcheted up process or ratcheted back process, depending upon the category and how we profiled it.  As I said earlier, is it a gross margin category, is it a sales-driving category, market share category, is it blend of both?", "So it's a little early.  But we'll, I think we'll see a bit more as we go through the fourth quarter.", "Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay.  That's great.  Good luck going forward here, for the rest of the year.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Once again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star 1.  Again, that is star 1 for questions.", "The next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "Hi, good afternoon.  My question is about the relationship between direct import purchases which I think you said are up 74%, and private label sales.  I'm assuming that virtually all of these are private label items.  Can you help us understand the relationship here in both the timing and the magnitude of these two dimensions, so, imports versus private label movement with the customer?", "Greg Sandfort", "Yeah, Mark, first of all, there is a difference.  We do import from some of our what I would call indirect relationships with vendors.  You know, heating category as an example.  We have some things we develop on our own, that\u2019s direct to factor, that's private label, that's us.  And then there's other products we bring in, in heating category that are brought through the channel of our logistics but is -- it's not a direct import per se.  We didn't develop it.  We didn't product-develop it.  So, there's a combination of things going on there.", "As far as the relationships, we had, as I've been saying the last couple of quarters, we were going to see a major push in the overall private brand expansion into the third, fourth quarter, particularly in the hard line side of the business, some in the soft line side, and you're seeing that, if you\u2019ve been in our stores, you'll see that right now.  That's been in the works and being executed against for many, many months.", "I would tell you, from a mix standpoint, whether that's going to all fall out, we're going to need to go through the fourth quarter before we can say how successful we were.  But initial results are very promising.  I like what I'm seeing with the sets, the quality of the product that's in the stores, and initial customer response, so.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "Great.  And then can you just remind us how this plays out through the P&L?  So, you get a higher markup on the direct import.  Does that go through the P&L when it's sold, or do you have average markup on the inventory that even before you sell it could help the margins?", "And then also curious if there's an impact on the accounts payable.  It typically has gone up with inventory, but this quarter was flat, a little bit down.  Thanks.", "Greg Sandfort", "First of all, it goes to the P&L when it's sold.  And then secondly, as far as the terms, as far as the balance of how much of the inventory is sitting out there, from a term standpoint, it's going to come down a little bit because of the fact that we're doing our own importing, you know, and we're putting some of our cash out in front.  But it's not significant at this point.  And the differential between the margin that you gain and what you give up on the discount side is always, for us, it's on the positive side.  It's many basis points of improvement.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "Great.  Thanks.  Great work.", "Jim Wright", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen.  Great quarter.  My congratulations as well.", "Jim Wright", "Thank you.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Greg, the first question, for you, on the big ticket, I guess while still this is the first quarter where you're really kind of excited about it, we have seen in some other quarters, I guess the second quarter of 2010 when you responded with a good opening price point assortment of outdoor power equipment, in the fourth quarter last year with weather we saw some decent sales, maybe not as strong as this, but at least a little bit better than expected.  Is this still from the opening price point side of the business, or are we starting to see a return to some of the fuller price points, big ticket items?", "Greg Sandfort", "It is a blend.  At this point in time it's a blend.  It's not just the opening price tier.  But again, it's early.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yeah.", "Greg Sandfort", "I would tell you that -- I believe there's probably some pent-up demand.  For example, a customer that last year was stranded because they didn't buy a snow blower, they're not going to let that happen again to themselves.  They're going to go out early this year and buy that snow blower.  So we see some of that as some of the early sales coming through.  That's just one item.  But it's really a blend.  It's not just the opening price point that we created about a year-and-a-half, two years ago.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay.  And then just on the gross margin drivers, could you remind us maybe, sort of go over where we are on each of those sort of implementation and then sort of realization of the benefits?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, let me give you at least where I think we are as far as innings, since we're in the World Series of baseball right now.  The strat sourcing side, I'd say we're probably in the third inning.  We are just not getting some momentum with product development and our overall coordination of that with strategic sourcing.  We're finding some new countries to source product, not just China.  The third inning.", "Private label expansion, maybe more, you know, maybe in middle of the fourth inning, because of what we've done this past fall, but a lot of improvement yet to be made there as far as other categories and expansion within an established category.", "On the price [stop], we talked about that earlier, that we've got all the buyers now into that process.  About 30%, 27% exact numbers of the products are out there already in the process.  We expect to have better than a third by the end of the year.  So we're going to make some more movement there.", "And then the last piece, the seasonal conversion, critically important now as we go through the fourth quarter and making the turn into spring, we came out of this past spring summer fairly clean, pleased with the inventories, as a matter of fact, probably could have pushed in fall earlier because we had such clean sell-throughs.", "So, in that seasonal conversion, we're probably more toward the sixth inning, I would say.  Still more room to improve the processes, but we're getting fairly good at the inventory management now and that seasonal conversion piece.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Actually just one real quickly to wrap up, so, the guidance, full-year comp guidance implies about 1-1/2 to 3 for the fourth quarter.  Looking at the commentary that inflation is about 2% to 3%, are we basically assuming that the entirety of the comp in the fourth quarter comes from the inflation benefit with potentially even a little bit of decline in comp transactions just based on the strength of the winter in 4Q10 -- I'm sorry, 4Q11 -- 10?", "Jim Wright", "Yeah, this is Jim.  As we think about the fourth quarter, a couple of things to keep in mind.  As we look at the second half in total, we have increased our second-half forecast obviously, which goes to Q4.  As you know, we're cycling a 13.1 comp.  We also had a record the day after Thanksgiving event a year ago.  In addition, we expect [December] to be a little warmer than last year and we all continue to be concerned about consumer sentiment as we look into the -- out into the fourth quarter.  December this year is a six-week month, but it's so -- it's quite aways away from us right now and difficult for us to look forward with that level of certainty.", "So as we think about our EPS range for the full year, and obviously you've all deciphered what that means for Q4, particularly relative to comps, as Tony said, we've started out very strong in October, and if that trend continues, we certainly have the opportunity to exceed the high end of the range that we've granted, and that would come because of comp levels above what you calculated and suggested.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Perfect.  Thank you, appreciate it.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.", "[Kate Lent] \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Hi, this is actually [Kate Lent] in for Matt Nemer.  Congrats again on a great quarter.", "I wonder, first, follow-up on the smaller format stores, I was wondering if you could talk about the rent expense compared to your larger stores, and also any early thoughts on the potential market opportunity.", "Jim Wright", "The rent on a per-square-foot basis is attractive.  I guess it would be a tad lower than what we're paying in the full-size markets.  The numbers that -- returns on sales, internal rate of return, all are virtually the same as the company we've built today.", "And with regard to the number of stores, we continue to do our research, validate our learning, and our expectation is sometime in the first half of next year we should be able to, with some certainty, predict what our first estimate with that could be.", "[Kate Lent] \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great.  And secondly, we've noticed that you've been looking to add some personnel in your e-commerce and multichannel departments.  And I'm wondering if you could share an update on any initiatives that you have to improve your e-commerce offering and better utilize the website to drive traffic to the stores, or your search engine optimization to capture new customers.", "Greg Sandfort", "[Kate], this is Greg; I'll speak to that.  We have a number of things that we're doing with our web presence.  The first is to improve the what I would call navigation and conversion.  And then from there, we're talking about a new platform, and I can go on and on.  The facts of this, we are now committed to saying, listen, we have to get in this space in the right way with the right people behind it and to give our customer basically the option, you know, we've got to get the conversion there.  We have to be able to give them the convenience to shop, when, how, where they want.  We know that, as an example, that more and more of our customers are coming to our site.  We're seeing this track on mobile, which is amazing for us.  I don\u2019t know if it's ever going to be as large as other companies, but we're seeing movement.", "So, yeah, we are behind this.  We've got a lot of initiatives.  Yes, we are out recruiting and putting together what we will believe be an 18.  We have a great team of people together today.  We're just very thinly staffed.  And we've come to the realization through some work with an outside consulting group that, to do this the way we want and to have a world-class site and business for the consumer and for the company in the next, say, 18 months to three years, we have to make some investment, and we're doing that.", "[Kate Lent] \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great.  We look forward to it.  Thanks so much.", "Greg Sandfort", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And next question comes from David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Yeah, hey, guys.  Great quarter.", "Jim Wright", "Thank you.", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Two questions if I could.  One, assuming the large ticket remains more vibrant here over the balance of the year, do you anticipate it staying in the same sort of price points and the brands next summer, next spring and summer?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, I would say yes.  I mean it's working for us now, Dave.  I don\u2019t think that we can take the attitude that we can take permission from a consumer just yet to say, let's start moving the price points up.  I think we've hit the sweet spot right now where they're comfortable.  And we know this customer fairly well through all the CRM data that we collect on them.", "The example that I give sometimes is the compressor store where we had a (inaudible) compressor.  We went back and re-engineered it, brought it under $1,000, and today it's now our number one compressor and continues to outsell anything and everything else in the compressor category.  And probably for the near future, we'll continue to do so.", "So, it's not so much about, you know, because things are just starting to open up, where we start to move price points up.  We have a good selection of good, better, best in most of these categories already.  What we did is just moved our inventory levels to where the consumer was at.  And in some categories, yes, we did probably enhance the opening price more moderate.  But we'll wait to see, the consumer is going to tell us.", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Right.  Thank you.  And just secondly, I came in late, so I apologize if you've already given color, but I'm curious about the hay products and how that's working in your stores right now.", "Greg Sandfort", "The hay program, I can comment to that briefly.  We actually have an excellent young man who is our buyer for the hay category.  He's out canvassing the markets.  We've got 100-plus stores in the business today.  It's part of the whole forage reset that we put in the stores about four, five months ago.", "The hay program also consists of trailered hay, you know, out behind the store.  So it's a multi-tiered program.  We're really probably just getting our feet positioned right now into that business.  I will tell you, we're very pleased, our customer is very pleased that we're carrying the product.  And this will be something there will be a rollout probably over the next three to four years, because, as you can imagine, you have to have space.  Space is the key here.", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Right.", "Greg Sandfort", "But glad you saw that and commented, and we're very pleased with it and excited that we can now offer to our customers.", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Very good.  Thank you.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next is Simeon Gutman with Credit Suisse.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Good afternoon.  Congratulations.  Tony, not sure if last quarter you tried to quantify how much the weather may have held back your comps.  I don\u2019t know if you have an idea this time how much some pent-up demand helped.", "And a follow-on regarding inflation.  Can you give a little more granularity on it with regard to next quarter's expectations?  Because it seems like the step-up you saw this quarter is more or less enough just to get you there alone.  So, what's being cycled and what's staying on in terms of the inflation picture?", "Tony Crudele", "Sure.  Let me handle the inflation.  As we look forward again, our best estimate, we're looking at our current selling prices relative to the cost, the key driver and the quickest turn will be in the grain categories.  In particular, we use corn as a guide.  And we have seen a relative precipitous drop in corn recently.  And as we track that go forward, I would expect that slight decrease there would be very beneficial.  That would be the difference as far as looking at the third quarter versus the fourth quarter.", "Relative to weather patterns for the quarter, we did not quantify Q2.  We did believe that we had a significant impact in Q2 from April.  And as you sort of string together our comments, you can assess that we've had five very strong months since a very weak weather-driven April.", "As we look at Q3, year over year, generally weather is not overly impactful to Q3.  Where it can be impactful is on hurricane-related preparedness.  And again, we gave you a number, total impact overall to comp sales of about 90 basis points.  And then, of that, the big tickets impacted about 60 basis points, or the generator piece impacted about 60 basis points on the big ticket sales.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay.  And for Greg, mentioned that the heating piece has started off well.  Is there any difference in timing of placement of that product, whether markets or difference in selection also that's helping drive that?", "Greg Sandfort", "I can tell you that we were not earlier necessarily, but in a much deeper stock position in the north.  That was one of the strategic things last year that we kind of trickled the product in too much.  This year we made a big impact up north.  And we now are completely set across the company.  So I would say we did a better job in execution this year, far better than we did in years past.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay.  And then one last one for Tony, I guess, on gross margin.  Looking out towards 2012, it looks like this year you're held back by freight which could go up, could go down, some mix, and then a little bit of inflation pass-through.  Just by cycling those, does it -- should it -- does it make sense that we should see maybe an above-average amount of gross margin expansion just because some of the underlying initiatives seem to be progressing well but maybe hit a little bit by some of these headwinds.  So, is it reasonable to assume slightly more than we saw this year just by cycling some of those items?", "Tony Crudele", "I think intuitively you could come to that conclusion.  We would have -- we're going to be working through the numbers obviously as we move into the budget cycle for 2012 and really examine of the other influences.", "We do expect that inflation will moderate next year, and we would -- are very hopeful that diesel prices will be much more comparable year-over-year.  Based on those two factors, you could conclude that we could have -- we could be in a position for a little bit more stronger margin improvement, probably more so as we move through the sort of this second half of the year.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay.  Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Moving on to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks a lot.  Good afternoon and congratulations on your performance.", "On the four strategic drivers of gross margin, I think you gave us a baseball analogy for three of the four, price optimization, maybe it's a bit redundant, I would imagine it's in early innings state.  But what I'd also like you to do is, if you could dimensionalize or kind of rank them in their potential contribution to gross margin rate over time.  That'd be very helpful for us.", "Greg Sandfort", "All right, Matt, this is Greg.  I would tell you that over time -- I'm going to start this way.  I'm going to say, as of today, and will go on for the next couple of years, price optimization will take us a good five years.  So that's a five year trek.  I would say, sooner than that, you're going to see the private label and strategic sourcing pieces kicking in.  We've been working on that longer.  We're now starting to see some benefit this year.  So those two components will be adding more value to the gross margin line sooner than price op will because it's going to take long for price op.  And seasonal conversion, I mention that earlier, we're in good shape there, sixth, seventh inning.  We're more doing refinement now than anything else.", "So it's probably ranked that way, strat sourcing, private label expansion, I would say, price op, and then seasonal conversion at the end.", "Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it.  And then just by way of follow-up on the drivers of same-store sales for the fourth quarter, you just got a question on inflation.  If we think about traffic, the pickup -- the pickup in traffic your business last year from Q3 to Q4 was largely ticket, and the traffic certainly accelerated.  Would there be any reason for the two-year traffic stack to decelerate from Q3 to Q4?  Was the weather that impactful in driving transactions a year ago?", "Tony Crudele", "Matt, this is Tony.  It's not necessarily weather-driven in the fourth quarter, although it was a fairly cold above-average December and there were a few storms.  So that does factor into it.", "From a transaction standpoint, we would anticipate that we would continue to drive transactions, where we feel the wildcard is with the consumer and to what extent will he be driving the average ticket up.  We anticipate that there will be some inflation, obviously, but that could be offset by potentially a lower ticket.", "So there may be some slight compression in the transaction year-over-year, but we still believe that that will be the driver of the business.  And as we stack really almost a three-year comparison, that we can continue to drive the transactions in Q4.", "Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And then one final follow-up to that, if you take your comments from earlier about the pickup in big ticket x inflation and x the impact of the hurricane, and it sounds like it came from a couple of different -- a couple of different categories, not necessarily related.  If you think back your all's experiences in the business over time, the areas where you saw this pickup typically accelerated with cyclical improvement or would you say it's actually just a bit more random than that at this stage?", "Jim Wright", "I'd say much more random.", "Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it.  Okay, that's fair.  Thank you so much.", "Jim Wright", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Chris Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks.  Good evening.  First, on the sales side, can you talk about the cadence of sales last year in the fourth quarter?  Did the acceleration (inaudible) around the timing of your Black Friday promotions and then build into yearend, or was it pretty spread evenly?", "Tony Crudele", "I would agree that we saw a nice acceleration with November and December, but it was really focused sort of post Black Friday.  So, day after Thanksgiving onward was a very strong period for us, although generally the entire quarter was very firm.", "What you really have to do is look back and do a two-year comparison because the prior-year comparison in November was very, very warm November.  And that was one of the reasons why last year was such a significant comp increase in November.", "But as far as when we look at sort of the pure transactional drivers in the business, it really was driven by day after Thanksgiving and continued improved sales in the month of December.", "Chris Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yup.  Understood.  And then on the gross margin, it would seem like, I don\u2019t know the math, direct margins, product margins were up 100 or so basis points in the third quarter.  And as you think about the fact that the gas prices are receding and perhaps inflation receding and helping mix a little bit, why would gross margins only be up 10 to 20 basis points in the fourth quarter?", "Tony Crudele", "Again it's really the mix, is one of the bigger drivers.  And obviously the more freight-intensive goods that we have as far as the movement of good, those freight costs obviously will drive that number as well.  But it's really, you know, our concern is the mix, and obviously last quarter we said we were sort of in the sort of 30-basis-point range as far as the negative mix impact.  So that's one of the concerns that we've had.", "Additionally, as we manage the inflation, it obviously can be a positive, as Jim talked about, we've really focused on margin dollars versus the rate.  But as the inflation moves through the cost and the cost moves through that cycle, you can start to experience some margin compression.", "So there's a few other components that would offset what we'd normally anticipate being able to get some tailwind or some benefit from some other factors relative to margin.", "Chris Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan", "Fair enough.  And one final one, just as we think about I guess the sourcing side, sourcing was up, what, 70%, 74% year-over-year, up to about 13%.  S, is it -- that margin benefit, is it just fair enough to say, hey, I take that delta, which is 6%, and then multiple by like a 600 to 800-basis-point lift, or is -- in terms of the margin benefit?  Or is direct sourcing less than the private label?", "Tony Crudele", "Generally the direct sourcing will have more of a benefit than the private label because the private label may be driving an opening price point.  But what we look at, clearly the simple math would be there's a gross margin benefit and you would multiply that by the percentage increase.", "I just want to make sure that you have your numbers correct.  On a year-over-year basis, we've driven imports from about 7.5% to close to 9%, so, as a percent of the business.  And that did represent about a 40% increase in total purchases.  So, the numbers are fairly large but the percentage currently is relatively low.  But as we continue to grow that over the next several years, you can obviously take the margin improvement by the percentage increase.  But I think the numbers that you had just thrown out there, I just want to make sure you're grounded with those numbers, because as much as we feel it's a significant increase, it's not as impactful right now to the P&L.", "Chris Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yup.  No, thanks for clarification.  Take care.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "[Bernard Shelton] \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Hi.  This is [Bernard Shelton] in for Brad.  I'm wondering if you could talk about the competitive environment and what are you seeing, any changes from home improvement or pet specialty retailers?", "Jim Wright", "Nothing that's -- other than the fact there were some store closures going on out there, and actually some of those are in markets which are small for them that we participate in.  We've not seen a great deal of change with regard to category development, price reactions, any significant change in marketing that's impacting our business.", "[Bernard Shelton] \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thanks.", "Jim Wright", "You're welcome.", "Well, inclosing, first of all, I'd like to thank the 16,000 team members who serve our customers everyday and make this kind of quarter possible.", "The consistency of our stellar performance indicates that we have a lot to be proud of here at Tractor Supply.  Throughout the years we've been very deliberate with our strategic planning, steadfast in our executions.  They were a much stronger and larger retailer with the right plan systems and people in place.  This indeed has led to the structural shifts in our business and our brand, we are, we believe, are very well-positioned for near and long term.  But as you heard us say before, while we might be proud, we are absolutely not satisfied, and we are dedicated to continue both improve and grow our business.", "We appreciate you taking this journey with us and look forward to speaking with you at the end of Q4.

[Operator instructions.] I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Jennifer Milan of FTI Consulting. Please go ahead, Jennifer.", "Jennifer Milan", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, let me take a moment to reference the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the future operating and financial performance of the company. Although the company believes that the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations or any of its forward-looking statements will prove to be correct.

Investors should not assume that the statements will remain operative at a later time. Lastly, Tractor Supply Company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed in this call.", "Now, I\u2019m pleased to introduced Greg Sandfort, president and chief merchandising officer. Greg, please go ahead.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you, Jennifer, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m here today with Jim Wright, our chairman and CEO, and Tony Crudele, our CFO. We\u2019re very pleased with our first quarter results, and are very excited that we achieved another significant milestone for Tractor Supply Company, generating first quarter sales of over $1 billion for the first time in the company\u2019s history.", "Our results continue to reflect broad-based strength with solid performance in all areas of the store and in all regions. Our team again executed exceptionally well in what continues to be a very challenging retail environment. ", "The strides we are making in the areas of inventory management, merchandise allocation, and expanded regionalization of our assortments continued to contribute to our performance. We are delighted to have generated another quarter of double digit increases in both sales and profitability on top of record results a year ago.", "Now let me provide a little more detail on our first quarter performance. We did anticipate stronger first quarter results than our business has historically exhibited due to the calendar shift created by the 53rd week last year. We also benefited from our improved ability to both plan for, and react to, seasonal weather patterns and changes in our customers\u2019 wants and needs.", "As stated on our prior call, we accelerated product flow of spring sets in our southern markets this year while planning concurrent marketing expenditures in those same regions to drive sales. These planned shifts, based on our analysis of historical sales patterns, allowed us to more fully capture peak demand in these markets, especially given the early break we experienced in spring weather this year.", "At the same time, we are recognizing and reacting more quickly to the sales trends and customer demand that develop in our business daily. With the warmest winter on record, we acted quickly in January and February to clear through winter seasonal merchandise to minimize seasonal carryover. With our improved ability to react, we were able to take advantage of the early spring weather in March, increasing inventory flow of top seasonal SKUs and adjusting store replenishment patterns.", "Our proactive planning approach and improved systems capability enabled us to allocate merchandise more productively than ever before. In terms of specific sales drivers, our CUE categories remained key to increasing both traffic and sales, contributing to our 16th consecutive quarter of comp transaction count increases.", "We saw particularly strong performance from seasonal merchandise categories, especially big ticket items in the outdoor power equipment category. Along with sales of big ticket items, it was also gratifying to see our parts and repair business remain strong, where more typically we would experience customers either replacing or repairing these items, certainly not doing both.", "As we think about our first quarter performance, we were particularly pleased to see such broad-based strength across nearly all categories within the store and all regions of the country. To mention a few, customers were very receptive to our expanded assortments in live goods, which we introduced early in the south this year.", "Forage is still gaining momentum, and we have plans to expand the program to approximately 600 stores by the end of this year, a significant increase from 300 stores at the end of 2011. Additionally, our hardware and tools division continues to perform well, and our private brand groundwork for lawn and garden products added to our momentum across our seasonal categories.", "We continue to test and refine our assortments while successfully pursuing our strategy to balance both product selection of national brands while increasing private brand mix across multiple categories. ", "I\u2019d like to speak briefly if I could about our new store performance, which also contributed to our strong first quarter sales. This year we opened 33 stores in the first quarter, compared to 26 stores in the first quarter last year, and on average our openings were completed earlier in the quarter than a year ago. This is a record for TSC in terms of first quarter store openings, and we\u2019re on pace to open 50 of the 90-95 new stores planned for 2012 in the first half of this year. ", "In aggregate, the new stores we opened in the first quarter are exceeding their expected performance, and as we continued to expand our footprint in key regions, we remain very comfortable with our targeted annual square footage growth rate of approximately 8%.", "In closing, our first quarter results further confirm the momentum we believe we are gaining from the ongoing structural improvements we have made in our business. These improvements have enabled us to plan, prepare, execute, and react better than ever before. We always look to refine our assortments and provide compelling values to our customers every day, while improving our ability to meet their needs with the right products, in the right locations, at the right time.", "Looking to the remainder of 2012, we continue to be confident regarding the opportunities that lie ahead, and we believe we have the right people, products, and programs in place to increase our consumer engagement and further build our Tractor Supply brand.", "I\u2019d like now to turn the call over to Tony to review our financial results for the quarter and discuss our outlook. Then Jim will then share his closing remarks. ", "Tony Crudele", "Thanks Greg. Good afternoon everyone. We had another terrific performance in the first quarter, with broad-based strength from nearly all aspects of the business. ", "For the quarter ended March 31, 2012, on a year over year basis, net sales increased 22% to $1.02 billion, and net income grew by 120% to $40.3 million, or $0.55 per diluted share. As a reminder, our Q1 2012 results reflect the calendar shift associated with the 53rd week in 2011. ", "Comp store sales increased 11.5% compared to last year\u2019s reported increase of 10.7%. Adjusting for the week shift, last year\u2019s comp store sales increase would have been 7.6%. We are pleased with the strong comp store sales growth, which was driven by a combination of both ticket and transactions.", "Non-comp sales were $59 million, or approximately 5.8% of sales. Comp transaction count increased for the 16th consecutive quarter, gaining 4%. We had one less comp day as a result of the calendar shift, which we estimate would have added approximately 110 basis points to the comp transaction count and overall comp sales. Our CUE products, serving our customers\u2019 basic and functional needs, remained an important driver of footsteps. ", "The trend in average comp ticket exceeded the comp transaction increase for the second consecutive quarter. Average comp ticket gained 7.1% versus last year\u2019s reported 2.3% increase. The increase resulted from a combination of inflation; an increase in big ticket purchases, which benefited from an early riding lawnmower season; and an increase in items per transaction.", "We continued to experience broad-based sales strength with respect to both merchandise categories and geographic regions. All nine of the geographic regions had strong positive upper single digit or low double digit comp store sales. Generally, sales were the strongest in the northern regions as a result of record warm weather and favorable moisture levels. The broad-based nature of sales growth supported positive comps during each month of the quarter, with March being the strongest month as a result of the early spring. ", "As we stated in our business update, we believe that due to the early spring weather this year, a significant amount of sales in Q1 were likely pulled forward from Q2 that we do not expect to recur in the second quarter. Although difficult to estimate, we looked at the normal selling cycle of the more significant spring categories and overlaid that with the selling trends of the early spring for those categories. We estimate that approximately $34-38 million in sales may have shifted into Q1 from Q2, representing approximately $0.09 to $0.11 in earnings per share.", "Inflation was at the high end of our expectations for the quarter as we estimate that it contributed approximately 400 basis points to our top line sales. Inflation was most evident in bird feed, livestock feed, pet food, and lubricants.", "Turning now to gross margin, which, as a percentage of sales, decreased by 9 basis points to 32.6%. Direct product margin percent continued to be negatively impacted by mix shift to CUE products and by inflation. While the overall gross margin rate declined slightly, we increased the number of units sold and maintained the gross margin dollars earned on each unit. The merchandise team continued to do an excellent job managing gross margin dollars during the quarter.", "We are aggressively managing our markdown cadence as we took advantage of solid traffic patterns to quickly clear cold weather merchandise and reduce the seasonal inventory risk posed by this year\u2019s condensed winter. We estimate that this has had a negative impact of approximately 20 basis points on gross margin.", "The freight headwind we have been experiencing is beginning to moderate as we begin to cycle the higher freight costs of last year. Freight cost increased by 14 basis points over last year, compared to 37 basis points in the fourth quarter. This increase was driven by higher fuel costs and costs associated with increased import activity of seasonal goods. The increase in big ticket sales also had a negative impact on margin of close to 20 basis points. ", "As a part of our strategic sourcing initiative, import purchases in the quarter accounted for 8% of total purchases, which is a greater than 36% increase year over year. Shrink was favorable 16 basis points to our gross margin rate as we continued to see improvement from our loss prevention programs and continued employment of technology. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to successfully manage gross margin while continuing to provide great values to our customer.", "For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, was 26.3% of sales, reflecting nearly 300 basis points of improvement from the prior year\u2019s quarter. The improvement in SG&A rate resulted principally from leverage provided by our strong same-store sales growth. ", "Over two-thirds of the SG&A leverage came from store payroll and occupancy. We maintained very strong payroll management as a result of profit improvements and better allocation of hours to high-traffic periods. This, coupled with the same-store sales growth, created significant SG&A leverage.", "Although the warm January and February hampered winter sales, we did receive a benefit on the occupancy line as several expenses, such as utilities, snow removal, and floor care were very favorable relative to last year.", "Incentive compensation was lower than last year and had a favorable impact of 31 basis points on our SG&A rate for the quarter.", "Turning to the balance sheet, at quarter end we had $126.7 million in cash compared to $140.4 million last year. During the first quarter, under our stock repurchase program we acquired approximately 54,700 shares for $4.1 million. We estimate there was minimal impact to EPS from share repurchases in the quarter. ", "Average inventory levels per store at quarter end were 1.3% lower than last year. Annualized inventory turns were 3.06 times, or a 26 basis point improvement versus last year. We are very pleased with the inventory productivity, particularly in light of the earlier flow of merchandise for the spring season, the embedded inflation, and having one more distribution center than at this time last year.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $31.8 million, compared to $28.9 million last year. This increase in capital spending related principally to the opening of more stores during the first quarter 2012 than in the first quarter last year. We opened 33 stores this quarter versus 26 stores in the first quarter last year.", "Turning to our outlook, as reported in our April 12 business update, as a result of our strong performance in the first quarter, we increased our financial expectations for full year 2012. We expect net sales for the full year to range between $4.61 billion and $4.68 billion. Correspondingly, same-store sales for the year are expected to increase in the range of 4% to 5.5% ", "Net income is now expected to be in the range of of $260 million to $265 million, or $3.52 to $3.60 per diluted share.", "I would like to quickly discuss a few of the specific drivers underlying the assumptions for the remainder of the year embedded in our full year guidance. We expect the retail environment will be stable and our customers will continue to shop our stores for basic and everyday needs as they did in Q1 and in 2011, and that they will remain price conscious and value-oriented. ", "With the week shift in our calendar this year, on an adjusted basis, we will be cycling a very solid 7.1% same-store sales increase in the second quarter. Now let me remind you that we had soft sales in April last year due to very cold weather. So although the sales for April to date have been very favorable to last year, we believe that it is more appropriate to view April and May sales on a combined basis before forming an opinion on the second quarter, especially in light of the sales pull-forward into Q1 from Q2.", "Although we expect to drive margin improvement during the remainder of the year through our gross margin initiatives, we expect limited to flat year over year gross margin improvement in Q2 as a result of freight headwinds and continued mix shift to more freight-intensive CUE products. ", "However, similar to the first quarter, we do expect freight headwinds to moderate in the second quarter as we begin to cycle the accelerated fuel costs we experienced in 2011. With respect to inflation, we expect that that impact will moderate in the second quarter as we begin to cycle the commodity price increases that we experienced last year. ", "Overall, we expect an inflationary impact of 3-4% in the second quarter and we have increased our inflation forecast range to 2-3% for the full year from 1-2% previously.", "We expect leverage to SG&A as we continue to be more efficient with our store payroll and leverage occupancy at our forecasted comp sales range. ", "For the full year, we still forecast effective tax rate will be approximately 36.8%, an increase from 36.5% in 2011. This will result principally from a reduction in expected federal tax credits. ", "We have made no changes to our expected store growth rate or plans for capital spend. We plan to open 90-95 new stores in 2012, 50-55% of which will open in the first half of 2012. We project capital expenditures in 2012 will range between $160 million to $170 million, which includes approximately $40 million as a placeholder for our leased store acquisition program, $11 million for a potential land acquisition for a southeast distribution relocation, and an incremental $6 million as part of our ecommerce replatforming. ", "We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program as part of our long term objective of reducing our cost of capital and maintaining targeted cash balances of $100-150 million. With our limited share purchases in the first quarter, we currently estimate that diluted shares outstanding, inclusive of option grant and share repurchase activity, will approximate $73.8 million for the full year.", "To conclude, we are very pleased with the performance in the first quarter. We are proud that our initiatives are driving both top and bottom line increases, and believe that the company is well-positioned for another record year in both sales and earnings.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jim. ", "Jim Wright", "Thanks Tony, and good afternoon everyone. Tractor Supply has made substantial progress on many initiatives over the past few years that are enabling us to plan, react, and execute better today than at any time in our company\u2019s history. ", "The operational benefits from these improvements continue to take hold as clearly was demonstrated by our record first quarter performance. As an example, our proactive planning allowed us to benefit this year from an earlier spring selling season in southern markets. We also reacted quickly in northern markets to minimize the seasonal risk posed by the condensed winter season this year, and then shifted very quickly to capitalize on the early spring weather seen in March. Frankly, we would not have been able to execute at this level only a year ago. ", "Regarding the current retail environment, consumers continue to look for compelling value. Purchases continue to be driven by need, and take place closer to need. We remain firmly committed to our strategy of providing exceptional value to our customers in this environment.", "We\u2019ll continue to refine our assortments and the in-store experience to maintain newness and to keep our customers highly engaged with the Tractor Supply brand. As we enhance our assortments, we\u2019ll maintain our focus on being the most reliable supplier to our customers for their consumable, usable, and edible needs.", "We remain focused on private label brands. This has been a very successful strategy for us, as most recently demonstrated by the strong performance seen across several seasonal categories, with groundwork in the first quarter of this year. We believe we have further opportunity to build on our private label initiative across multiple categories, particularly in areas where there is not currently a strong brand allegiance.", "We continue to roll out price optimization and improve our capacity to grow both market share and margin rate. We also continue to mine data from our CRM and direct mail programs, refine our marketing strategies, and improve the productivity of the marketing spend. ", "We are confident that we can increase share of wallet with existing customers and to grow our customer base. We\u2019ll also continue to expand our footprint in key regions as we grow toward a recently increased domestic potential of 2,100 stores.", "As Greg mentioned, the new stores we opened this year are collectively exceeding our expectations. Our prudent approach to expense management, along with our commitment to a strong balance sheet, will allow us to continue investing in our business and increasing shareholder value.", "And with that, operator, I\u2019d now like to open the call up for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] We\u2019ll go first to David McGee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. ", "David McGee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Just a question regarding the live goods trial that you\u2019ve been doing. Could you give us, if you care to, the impact on comps or what the relative margin looks like on that product? ", "Greg Sandfort ", "As far as a percentage of comp, we don\u2019t usually talk to that. What I can say is this. It\u2019s in different levels throughout the company. We mentioned earlier that we started with a heavier penetration in the south, and that was the first deliveries, and then we moved into the mid- and to the north, and it\u2019s just starting to get dense in the north.", "Very pleased with our sell-throughs. As a matter of fact, we found that we have more potential for more business because some of the sell-throughs were really far greater than we thought, chasing a little bit of that business. ", "We\u2019re not like the big boxes. It\u2019s different products. You know, it\u2019s fruit trees, and it\u2019s not shade trees. It\u2019s not flowering shrubs, it\u2019s more greenery and things of that nature. But what I can tell you about the business is that we\u2019re still in the early stages of developing this. It\u2019s unique to us.", "From a margin standpoint, if it\u2019s managed well it would be clearly in line with the overall company margins. And we\u2019re not seeing anything at this point in time with our current performance that would lead us to believe any different. ", "David McGee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Secondly, on the big ticket purchases, is there anything that would give you confidence that the uptick that you\u2019ve seen in the first quarter will persist in the second quarter? ", "Greg Sandfort ", "I would give you a positive on that of no. I don\u2019t think that what we\u2019ve seen early on gives us any feeling that the customer is responding back and saying it\u2019s time to now replace versus repair, because as I mentioned in my comments, our repair business continues to be very, very strong, continues to grow year after year. So I don\u2019t think the replacement cycle is here just yet.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Vincent Sinisi with Bank of America. ", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America", "You said your inflation expectations for the year basically are a percent higher than what you had been originally thinking. Can you give us any clarity in terms of is anything truly catching you surprised from a cost perspective? And then maybe an update to your gross margins for the year? I believe last you had spoken about it, you said somewhere in the neighborhood of 10-15 basis points? ", "Tony Crudele", "When it comes to inflation, again, I\u2019d like to remind you that this is really just a snapshot, a point in time, where we will look at currently where we\u2019re at and compare it to last year. So again, it\u2019s not a true projection. When we do that, the difference that we saw versus a quarter ago when we gave our full year projection, is in two areas, one in the birdseed category as well as in the grass seed area. Those are two areas that sort of jumped out at us that the prices held up a little bit higher than we had anticipated when we looked at it three months ago. So those were two drivers. Other than that, I would say we\u2019re generally close to our forecast. ", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America", "And as a follow up, if you could just give us a current state of where you are with the smaller market stores? How many right now? And maybe for this year the percentage of the new stores you think that may be the smaller markets? ", "Tony Crudele", "When it comes to small markets, we probably purposely haven\u2019t provided information as to the numbers, because when we look at that program we really look at it as taking a store and sizing it properly for a market. So now, as we look out on the 2,100 potential store sites, we just really see it as a mix, and on a going forward basis we\u2019ll continue to update as far as square footage growth and still targeting 8% square footage growth. ", "But when we look at the stores, still very productive and we\u2019ll grow the base, and as you look at the remaining, say, thousand stores, just in round numbers, 300 of which we look at as being small market stores. We\u2019re going to be opening those in sort of the same ratable proportion. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from John [Lawrence] with Stephens. ", "John [Lawrence] - Stephens", "Just real quick, Tony, would you comment a little bit on the $34-38 million that you basically extracted from the second quarter and just talk a little bit about some of those product categories that you feel have pulled forward? Greg mentioned the OPE a little bit. So if that\u2019s the case, how much of the cycle do you think is over for that product, or certainly declining as we get into the second quarter?  ", "Tony Crudele", "We clearly looked at some of the stronger lawn and garden categories. Obviously the one that comes to mind is the riding lawnmower, probably easiest to wrap your mind around. Obviously when you look at that, it\u2019s very difficult for us to assess whether there\u2019s going to be continued pent up demand or if there\u2019s a replacement cycle. ", "So what we did was, we looked at the selling curve that we\u2019ve normally seen in past. We looked at years that were very reflective of the current year that we\u2019re in. And we looked at what their cycles were and then compared it to the norm and said we estimate that this amount of sales potentially came earlier. Now, again, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there may be some additional sales and that curve may be extended. And that\u2019s what we don\u2019t know as of yet. ", "But we looked at categories such as the riders, sprayer chemicals, lawn and garden, grass seed, things like that, where there might be just one planting and there might not be a secondary purchase later in the quarter. And again, best estimate, and we really only find out as we work through the April-May time cycle.  ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Dan Wewer with Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Expenses at a store level were essentially flat year over year. It looks like that\u2019s the best showing since the second quarter of 2009 and typically there\u2019d be maybe a 2-3% underlying rate of inflation in different categories. Is this going to be sustainable? And then also, curious, why would the incentive comp have declined given the success the company achieved during the quarter? ", "Tony Crudele", "First question, of whether it\u2019s sustainable, I would say no, it\u2019s not to the order of magnitude that we saw in the first quarter. As I stated earlier, because of the warm winter, some of the expenses that we normally would incur we did not. And so we had some significant favorable variances when it came to utilities. Obviously gas and electric, and floor maintenance and snow removal. So those were three or four of the key elements that I would tell you that it would not be the normal year over year expense increase that you would see. So not sustainable from that standpoint.", "When you look at the bonus accrual, obviously it\u2019s based on what our expectations are for that particular quarter, and each year we are obviously challenged based on a forecast for that particular year. And as we looked at the variance and estimate the bonus in the first quarter obviously there\u2019s a lot of subjectivity as to how we perceive the entire year to be coming out. Additionally, there\u2019s some either over- or under-accruals when it comes to the prior year and being caught up or not. So there was some play there as well when it comes to the bonus accrual. ", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "Could you extrapolate that, that the reduction in the accrual actually implies that first quarter was below your original expectations, your in-house expectations? ", "Tony Crudele", "No, the first quarter was well above our expectations. ", "Dan Wewer - Raymond James", "And just out of curiosity, you guys have been amazing in your ability to forecast weather and how to adjust your merchandise allocation. What does your crystal ball say about the second quarter? ", "Greg Sandfort ", "We don\u2019t have a crystal ball unfortunately. We have a weather service we use. We use NOAA. We look at our business. I think the difference is simply this. We have a tremendous working relationship with the vendor community, probably stronger today than it\u2019s ever been. We build a lot of our products on forecast, and then we flow against what\u2019s developing in the business. So it\u2019s easier to address things early in the season because you\u2019ve got production there and you\u2019ve got capacity. It\u2019s more difficult in the latter part, but with the favorable March weather, we were able to basically just turn the dials and push the inventory through and chase that business. ", "And again, we anticipated a little bit of that because, as I said, we shifted the south deliveries earlier. We\u2019d been hearing from our stores that we needed the product down there much earlier, and we also shifted a piece of our marketing effort into the first quarter, both of which proved to be very prudent and very beneficial for the first quarter business. So this is just about running the business a lot smarter and also having some capabilities that we have today that honestly we didn\u2019t have in years prior. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. ", "John - Piper Jaffray", "This is actually John on for Peter. I realize you guys don\u2019t guide by quarter, but with the shifting weeks in Q2, is there any way you could give us some kind of range or rough quantification on how we should think about the Q2 comp? ", "Tony Crudele", "Well, when it comes to the Q2 comp, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the reported comp last year was 4.6%, which was the lowest during the year last year. So there was an expectation that would be our easiest compare. But when we adjust it for the comparable weeks that we will have in the quarter this year, it\u2019s a 7.1% quarter. So it\u2019s a little bit more robust, a little bit more challenging quarter than what it would appear when it comes through the quarters. ", "John - Piper Jaffray", "And then secondly, I know it\u2019s really early for you guys and your new TV ad initiative that you\u2019re running in three test markets, but can you give us any indication on how or where non-shoppers are responding to the message? ", "Jim Wright", "We ran the first flight last year from late September through Thanksgiving, and frankly we\u2019re not happy with the lift we got. We got a lift, but the lift did not principally come from the aware non-shopper. So as a result, we did a tremendous amount of research and the ad flight that is running as we speak in the same three markets has a significantly different theme and we have not nuanced at all what products we carry and what products we don\u2019t carry. It\u2019s a very straightforward ad campaign. Actually we have our own store managers as a spokesperson. ", "But the flight just kicked off and it\u2019s premature for us to read anything at this point in time. But we remain really very excited about the number of potential customers who have a misunderstanding of our stores and our products and who in our test groups, once we\u2019ve explained it, indicate a very high tendency to want to shop our stores. So more to come as we get through the next 13 weeks or so of this test. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Mark Miller with William Blair. ", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "I was hoping you could expand a little bit on the improved shrink. It seems like that benefitted you as you picked up here. And should we expect that can be a sustained improvement in future periods? And then I\u2019d like to get an update on maybe one of the other dimensions in the store operations, and it\u2019s the store manager retention. I believe that had improved, manager turnover had gone from 40% to 14%, but I think that was an improving trend. Was that something also that\u2019s helping you on the shrink? And where\u2019s that right now? ", "Tony Crudele", "I\u2019ll talk just briefly about shrink. We definitely had a very strong performance in the quarter. However, it\u2019s not something that we\u2019d be looking toward on a sustainable level. When we look at what we\u2019ve done in the area of loss prevention, over the last three to four years we\u2019ve made investments in technology, specifically put more cameras into our stores. And we\u2019ve rolled out that program to more than half the chain. And that\u2019s been done over the last several years. Our shrink has shown very sustained improvement over the last three years, and that\u2019s why you may have some choppy results quarter to quarter, and we obviously had a very successful quarter this year. But on an ongoing basis, we expect that to just be small relative incremental improvements over the next quarter in the next couple years.  ", "Greg Sandfort ", "With regard to manager turnover, yeah, your memory serves you pretty well. In 2000, our store manager turnover was about 44%. Between there and probably 2004-2005 we were able to bring that down into the mid-teens, where it remains today. The other factor within that mid-teen manager turnover we have is the mix of voluntary versus involuntary and then also the mix of who\u2019s leaving that we wish had not. And while we maintain that mid-teen level, we are really pleased with the continued talent development and retention rate of those who produced the greatest value for the company and the shareholder. So the bottom line is the team continues to strengthen at the store level and that also is a factor in shrink, amongst many, many other things. ", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "And my other question was going to be as you get stores opened earlier in the year, does that free up any field resources for more planogram changes later in the year, or is there any benefit from getting those stores in place earlier other than just being set up for second half sales? ", "Jim Wright", "Mark, let me see if I understand your question. Because, you say, we\u2019re opening more stores early, does that give us the opportunity to do things in the stores later because we\u2019ve kind of shifted the talent pool [unintelligible] earlier. Is that what you\u2019re saying? ", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "Yeah, just generally. ", "Greg Sandfort ", "What it can do for us is give us the ability to do some remodels of stores. We talked a little bit about reimaging at one point. You know, changing all the sign packages. So we have some capacity later in the year, yes, to have a few more things done in the stores. But we won\u2019t go beyond the early October date because to be honest with you we\u2019re then into the fourth quarter and we don\u2019t want to put anything in jeopardy. But yeah, it would give us a little bit of opportunity. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Alan Rifkin with Barclays. ", "", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays", "", "I was wondering, gentlemen, if you could provide some commentary on how to advertising line did relative to your plan and if that was a point of leverage at all for you in the quarter? ", "Greg Sandfort ", "I can talk to that a little bit. We did leverage advertising over a year ago in the quarter, even though we moved some expense in. And that was all primarily driven by, of course, the sales. Very pleased with how we did leverage, and I guess somewhat anticipated, but it really was all driven by the sales. So it was definitely the right thing to do for the business. ", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays", "Are you at liberty to say how much leverage it provided for you in the quarter? And what should we expect in Q2? ", "Greg Sandfort ", "First of all, I would say that, you know, we leveraged 5 basis points. It wasn\u2019t a lot. But we planned a little heavier spend for the quarter, so we came in under the plan. And for the second quarter, I would say that we\u2019re going to be similar to a year ago, even though we did shift one ad, because we\u2019re looking at probably some distribution increases in some markets that we thought were underserved a year ago. So light second quarter, a little bit of leverage first quarter. ", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays", "And one follow up if I may, Tony. How should we be thinking about the relatively modest share buyback in the quarter? Is that just a function of where the share price was? Can you elaborate on that a little bit? ", "Tony Crudele", "Sure. Absolutely it is our philosophy to continue to buy the shares, both as the stock is moving up or as, hopefully, it is declining. In this case, in the first quarter, as we set our matrix up for purchase, and we went into the period in which we don\u2019t adjust the matrix, the stock ran outside of that matrix and obviously resulted in very minimal purchases. But again, we\u2019ll continue to support the program on an ongoing basis.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Aram Rubinson with Nomura Securities. ", "Aram Rubinson \u2013 Nomura", "Obviously did a terrific job of repositioning inventory to take advantage of the weather and such. Was wondering, even as you chased a strong comp, did you miss sales would you say during the quarter? Is there some way to kind of measure how much sales you did miss, if that\u2019s the case? ", "Greg Sandfort ", "It\u2019s difficult to say what we may have missed. What I can tell you is we did have some very high sell-throughs in some categories so that would lead me to believe that there\u2019s more opportunity as we cycle this for next year. ", "Aram Rubinson \u2013 Nomura", "And then just looking to the second quarter, I remember on the last quarter you kind of commented that comps should be in the 3-5 range for each quarter. Does the pull-forward change that equation, or is that still safe? ", "Tony Crudele", "As we move forward, I would look at it as each quarter is going to generally be within that range, the full year range, which was very similar to our expectations at beginning of the year. ", "Aram Rubinson \u2013 Nomura", "And then just the last thing is the new stores that you said are opening stronger, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re opening more out on the west coast. Are you seeing anything consistent from the west coast that\u2019s driving better performance? Or just a comment on how you\u2019re feeling about that. ", "Jim Wright", "Actually, we\u2019re thrilled. California performed very well. Florida is continuing to perform very well for us. We did not [disproportionately] open stores in the west coast. It takes time out there. We\u2019re very methodical. We want to make sure that we cut the right long term deal. So there\u2019s only, I think, two stores in California in the quarter. The rest of the stores were opened - we expanded a little more into New Mexico. We have some activity there. And we will be entering Colorado in Q2.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. ", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "First, on the planning and allocation, obviously this is one of your older gross margin initiatives. If you were to sort of look back maybe to the first quarter of 2010, and you had a similar situation here where your winter changed pretty significantly and then the year-on-year spring changed pretty significantly, what do you think the impact - if there\u2019s any way to think about that - would have been relative to where we are now? And then what is left as we go forward? And then on same-store sales, just two questions. First, I think maybe when we started to talk about price opp, you had mentioned that there would be some earlier benefit on comps from price opp, if we were seeing any of that. And then secondly, on the big ticket, where in the pricing spectrum? Is it still low end? Big ticket? Or are we moving up to maybe more of the premium products? ", "Greg Sandfort ", "Okay, Adam. That was a quick flurry of three, so let me try to slow down here and answer all three if I can. Planning allocation, the difference between each year is really the shift of the weather, and our preparedness. I mentioned earlier that this year for the first time we really delivered into the south markets earlier. We kind of set them early, and then we kind of moved the flow toward the north. ", "We weren\u2019t doing that two years ago. Everyone was setting at a similar time. So that\u2019s a fairly large point of differentiation. And that takes more planning and seasoning with the planning and allocation team than you can imagine, because when you\u2019re bringing in imports, and you\u2019re buying domestic, and moving timing, and you\u2019re doing stores south and north, it\u2019s more complex than I can speak to. But that\u2019s the big difference there. ", "On the price opp, price opp is something that takes time, because here\u2019s what happens. When you go in and you price optimize five or six categories, and let\u2019s say 1,000 SKUs, it\u2019s not over at that point. You\u2019re optimizing, you\u2019re watching it, you\u2019re seeing what\u2019s happening. And the dynamics of the business, retail, things can change. Things can shift. Inflation comes in as a factor. Seasonality comes in as a factor. ", "So what we\u2019re learning here is that we are seeing, in some places - you know, we have two buckets that we really talk to the most. That\u2019s market share gain and gross margin. The blended bucket is probably the bucket that\u2019s most difficult to talk to. It\u2019s the smallest. But we are seeing market share growth, and it\u2019s all been positive of what we have touched at this date. I\u2019ll leave it at that.", "As far as big ticket, you asked about mix, higher end, lower end. It is truly a mix. Anything above $350 we consider big ticket. We did have a nice push in March in some of the outdoor power equipment categories. I would say above $1,000. But we do believe that some of that was a pull-in out of Q2. So we\u2019re going to have to just kind of manage our way through April-May to see how it plays out for the season. But still cautiously optimistic.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Joan Storms with Wedbush Securities. ", "Joan Storms -Wedbush Securities", "Some of the things that you mentioned earlier - on the forage business, that\u2019s one of the new merchandise issues, and you talked a little bit on the call. Can you quantify at all what that could be contributing to forward business as you roll that out across the chain? ", "Greg Sandfort ", "It\u2019s tough to say that forage is X percent or it\u2019s X dollars. What I can tell you is that it is bringing, in the overall category of feed products, it does give us an additional bounce in the business when a customer now can fulfill most of their needs for their large animal. That was a miss before. So we\u2019re still in, really, the early stages here. What we see is some market basket data we\u2019ve looked at, that people that were buying in other categories that are now buying in the hay or forage category seem to spend more. It\u2019s a typical - seen in a lot of other categories. So that\u2019s about as granular as I think I can really get at this point. ", "Joan Storms -Wedbush Securities", "And then also, maybe back to Jim, because he commented on this, on the marketing. The awareness of the Tractor Supply brand and people knowing that it\u2019s not just about tractors. You had done some TV, and I know people aren\u2019t doing a lot of newspaper flyers anymore, but Orchard Supply came public recently, and they\u2019re doing more newspaper flyers to let people know they\u2019re there. Is that something that you can use in your local rural markets? ", "Jim Wright", "A newspaper print is still in our mix. We have 15 print events a year, and they are distributed through mail or through newspaper distribution. That is down from 25 events a number of years ago. But it\u2019s an important part of our mix. We discovered that for the most part, print, for us, has not proven to be a good prospecting media. We\u2019re much better with electronic. And we\u2019ve talked about - you probably know my point of view on TV over the years - but TV for us has not proven to be a media where we can advertise and sell tomorrow. It is, however, a very good media if you\u2019re trying to communicate a message. So as a result, we are using TV and radio in this aware non-shopper test. But we will continue to use print, although frankly we see over time that we\u2019ll begin to socialize our print spend into more of an emphasis on direct mail. ", "Joan Storms -Wedbush Securities", "And Tony, could you just repeat the global sourcing percentages for me? Like from where you were and where you are. I missed that. ", "Tony Crudele", "In this quarter we said that it was 8% imports and that actually represented a 36% increase in the imports year over year.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Thomas Mahoney with Cleveland Research Company. ", "Thomas Mahoney - Cleveland Research Company", "Question on the comp guidance. You raised comp guidance by 75 basis points at the midpoint, and the inflation contribution is a point higher. I think you said 2-3% versus 1-2%. Is there anything moving you incrementally into more cautious on the core underlying demand Q2 through Q4, other than the pull forward issue? ", "Tony Crudele", "Not really. When we look at it at the back half, we did not make any significant adjustments to the back half relative to the strong performance of Q1. Generally we really like to look at Q1 and Q2 and look at the first half together so that before we make any adjustments to the back half of the year. So no significant takeaway relative to to overall comp guidance and the relevance impact of inflation. ", "Thomas Mahoney - Cleveland Research Company", "And then is there any more color you guys can give on the strength that you\u2019ve seen thus far in April? I guess if there\u2019s any quantification versus Q1, that would be helpful. And then specifically, in the big OPE, if that strength has continued in April. ", "Greg Sandfort ", "I can talk to a little bit of the outdoor power equipment categories. You can imagine that as we saw the business in the northeast shift there this one week, where we had snow and very cold weather, garden product and outdoor power equipment product slowed in that particular market for a few days. But in general the trends are continuing as they had through March. ", "But it\u2019s still early. It\u2019s still early, because here\u2019s what can happen, and we\u2019ve seen this in the past. If the moisture in the ground stops, meaning we start to dry out, it only takes several weeks in Texas and you literally impact the business severely. ", "And so we\u2019re just being cautious to say that right now we\u2019re in a great position with inventory. We have ample production waiting if the business continues to perform as it has. But I would not say that trends are going to be any different at this point, because it\u2019s still early in the game and they\u2019re still predicting drought in the south and it\u2019s still a wildcard. ", "Tony Crudele", "And I\u2019d just like to add, it\u2019s really critical that we sort of be patient as far as coming to any conclusions on Q2, because last year, as I mentioned earlier, April was very soft and as we always said, if April is soft, the sales will eventually come, and that meant May was a very strong month for us. So as we come into this year and actually have sort of the opposite scenario occurring, where we\u2019re cycling against a very soft April, our anticipation is that April will be very strong, and it has run to those numbers. But it is critical to wait to see how we perform against a very strong May next year. ", "When it comes to the cycle on the outdoor power equipment, as we look at that cycle, to the best of our estimation it looks as if the cycle did move forward a week. But again, it\u2019s too early to tell until we actually see the results as we get into May.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions at this time. Please continue with any closing comments.  ", "Greg Sandfort ", "Very good, thank you. First, I\u2019d like to elaborate a little bit on our stock repurchase plan. It\u2019s a long term plan, part of our strategy to return shareholder value. We use a 10b5-1 plan between the open windows, and frankly the plan we set in place, the share price just ran away from our matrix. But we intend to, as we always do, reestablish a matrix for the go forward quarter. ", "In closing, we\u2019re energized by the opportunities we see ahead, our ability to capitalize on those opportunities. We executed extremely well in the first quarter. We\u2019re very proud of the team. We reached another milestone of a billion dollar Q1, which is a terrific milestone for us to see. We look forward to the remainder of what has started out to be another exciting year for Tractor Supply Company, and we thank you all for being on the journey with us.

Jim, please go ahead.", "Jim Wright", "Thank you, Jen.  Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call.  I\u2019m here today with Greg Sandfort, our President and COO; and Tony Crudele, our CFO.  We are pleased with Q3 and year-to-date performance.  Each quarter we continue to build on our momentum, further demonstrating that the structural changes we have made in our business are contributing to our ability to profitably grow Tractor Supply.", "Before I turn the call over to Greg I\u2019d like to comment on our planned leadership transition.  It was recently announced I\u2019ll be assuming the role of Executive Chairman at the end of the year, at which point Greg will take on the role of Chief Executive Officer in addition to his current role as President.  The Board and management have been preparing for Greg\u2019s transition to CEO for some time.  With the talented team we have in place the Board and I believe this is the ideal time to complete this transition.  Having worked closely with Greg for the last five years, I know that we share a deep understanding and belief in the core cultural foundation of Tractor Supply and that we are aligned on Tractor Supply\u2019s business strategies and priorities.", "Over the past several years we\u2019ve built a differentiated and stable business.  We have a unique niche and a deeply experienced, energized and focused management team in place.  Due largely to Greg\u2019s leadership, we are improving our ability to react to and to capitalize on shifts that we see in our business from time to time.  Over the last twelve years it\u2019s been an honor to serve Tractor Supply\u2019s 17,000 plus team members and loyal shareholders through these chapters of successful growth.", "Tractor Supply is strongly positioned competitively, operationally and financially, and I believe it\u2019ll be a seamless transition.  I have the utmost confidence in the team\u2019s ability to continue executing Tractor Supply\u2019s key strategic initiatives and to continue the company\u2019s record of success.  I\u2019ve been privileged to work for an exceptional team and look forward to continuing to work with that team in my new role as Executive Chairman throughout the upcoming year.", "And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone.  We are very pleased with our Q3 results which again underscore the strength of our core business.  Our team at Tractor Supply continues to perform exceptionally well, particularly given what remains a challenging retail environment.  The progress we continue to make in the areas of new merchandise offerings, management of inventory, and our expanded regionalization of assortments have enhanced our overall operational performance.", "Now, let me provide a little more detail on our Q3 results.  As mentioned on our last call, with over 64% of the country in drought conditions as we entered Q3, weather was not ideal for a strong selling season.  Additionally, the lack of cold weather in the north in September contributed to less-than-ideal weather conditions for sales of cold weather products in that quarter.  That being said, we are delighted with the team\u2019s ability to successfully manage through these variables and deliver positive comparable sales.", "Our core businesses has solid increases again in Q3, and within our seasonal categories several big ticket products, such as heating and outdoor product equipment were negatively impacted.  However, with our ability to recognize and react quickly to sales trends, we turned our focus to other categories that could provide a sales lift.  And now, as cooler weather has come at the outset of Q4 we are experiencing stronger sales trends in fall in cold weather-related products.  Most importantly, we completed Q3 ending well positioned with the desired inventory levels to support sales in the all-important holiday season.", "We have often stated in the past that we believe it is most appropriate to look at Tractor Supply\u2019s performance by the halves rather than the quarters.  Our ability to deliver solid results in Q3 on top of a very strong comparison from last year positions us well for Q4.  In terms of specific sales drivers, our CUE categories \u2013 Consumable, Usable, Edible \u2013 remains strong and were key components to driving both traffic and sales, contributing to our eighteenth consecutive quarter of comp transaction count increase.  We\u2019ve also experienced solid performance from our exclusive or private brands with mix at roughly 25% of sales, up 1 percentage point from last year\u2019s Q3.  This slight increase was expected given our focus on growing our penetration of exclusive brands within our stores.", "Our Forage business continues to build momentum and we continue to expand our program.  We are on track to end the year with Forage in over 600 stores compared to just 300 stores at the end of 2011.  EquiStages, our exclusive brand of equine feed that was introduced about seven months ago, also continues to perform well within our mix of equine feed products.  ", "Our new store performance also contributed to our solid Q3 results.  This year we opened 17 new stores in Q3 as compared to 12 new stores in Q3 2011.  We\u2019ve remained very comfortable with our annual square footage growth rate of approximately 8% as we expand our footprint into new regions.", "So in closing, let me say that we continue to be delighted with our ability to manage our business and drive improved profitability during Q3 despite the challenging weather and retail environment.  The progress we have made on many of our key strategic initiatives continues to provide operational benefits, and we are planning, preparing, executing, and reacting better than ever before.  We continue to improve our understanding of our customers\u2019 changing needs and we regularly refine our assortments to provide compelling values every day, focusing on the right products in the right regions at the right time.", "Our business model today is well-balanced and will continue to provide sales momentum for Tractor Supply in the coming quarters.  I would now like to turn the call over to Tony to review our financial results for the quarter and discuss our outlook.  I will return afterwards to share several closing comments.", "Tony Crudele", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon everyone.  We had another very solid performance in Q3 to complete an extremely successful first nine months of 2012.  For the quarter ended September 29, 2012, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 9.0% to $1.07 billion and net income grew by 17.1% to $50 million or $0.69 per diluted share.  Comp store sales increased 2.9% for Q3 compared to last year\u2019s reported increase of 11.5%.  Adjusting for the one-week shift as a result of the 53rd week in F2011, we were actually cycling a comp store sales increase of 11.9% resulting in a strong two-year stacked double-digit comp.", "Non-comp sales were $64.1 million or 6% of sales.  As Greg stated, comp transaction count increased for the 18th consecutive quarter, gaining 2.6%; and we are very pleased with the core business as CUE products continue to help drive footsteps, resulting in sustained transaction count increases.  The average comp ticket was up 21 basis points compared to Q3 last year.  ", "The benefit to average ticket from inflation was offset by a decrease in big ticket purchases and other mix impacts.  Big ticket sales were hindered in the early part of the quarter by limited riding lawn mower sales as we experienced drought conditions throughout a large portion of the country.  There was also limited cold weather in the last few weeks of the quarter which limited sales of big ticket winter goods, particularly cold weather heating products.  Additionally, emergency response sales were less than in the prior year as we cycled Hurricane Irene.  Hurricane Irene had a more beneficial impact on sales last year as it affected a significant portion of the East Coast whereas this year\u2019s Hurricane Isaac was more isolated in its impact.", "Other key notes on the quarter: the quarter exemplifies the strength of the CUE products which posted a very high single-digit growth in both comp sales and units.  The strength of these products was consistent throughout the regions.  We did an excellent job of managing the variable weather conditions throughout the country including those regions that suffered through prolonged drought.", "On a regional basis, sales were strongest in the Southwest as we cycled last year\u2019s drought conditions in Texas.  We also generated incremental sales in the Louisiana area as a result of Hurricane Isaac.  The Southeast also performed very well as we had more moisture in that region and in the prior year that helped to extend the spring seasonal business.", "Comp sales trends were consistent in the first two months of the quarter; as expected, September\u2019s positive comp was the weakest of the three months as we cycled the sales lift from Hurricane Irene last year.  Additionally we experienced warmer than normal temperatures in the Northeast and we did not benefit from any of the cold snaps which typically signal the start of the fall/winter season and entice shoppers to start making cold weather purchases.  As the weather cooled in early October we experienced a notable improvement in some of the key seasonal categories.", "The impact of inflation was approximately 185 basis points for Q3 which was within our projected range of 100 basis points to 200 basis points.   Inflation was most evident in livestock feed, lubricant, grass seed and fertilizer categories.  Last year, inflation in Q3 was more impactful on comp sales at approximately 465 basis points.", "Turning now to gross margin, which as a percent of sales was essentially flat compared to last year\u2019s 33.5%.  Direct product margin benefited from product mix as we sold less lower-margin big ticket merchandise than last year.  As I noted earlier, as a result of the drought conditions we sold less power equipment such as riding mowers in the early part of the quarter.  Also as I mentioned, lower-margin cold weather heating products have shifted into October which benefited margin in Q3.  We also continue to benefit from our price optimization, imports and exclusive brands, and markdown initiatives.  ", "Unfavorable gross margin impacts were offset partially by the impact of some of our CUE products such as seed and pet that have margin rates slightly below chain average.  We estimate this at approximately 15 basis points.  Freight increased approximately 10 basis points and also partially offset the product margin benefit we experienced in the quarter.  This increase in freight resulted principally as a result of the costs related to increased import activity of seasonal goods and the negative impact on freight related to mix shift to freight-intensive CUE products.", "Contrary to our historical trend, the year-over-year reduction in emergency response sales actually had a negative impact on gross margin as a result of the merchandise mix.  Lower-margin generator sales that we experienced in the early part of the quarter related to storms in the Northeast were comparable to the generator sales from last year\u2019s Hurricane Irene.  However, this year\u2019s decrease in sales of the other ancillary high-margin emergency response categories, such as tarps and batteries, resulted in a negative impact on gross margin in the current quarter. ", "Import purchases in the quarter accounted for 13.0% of total purchases, which represents a 6.9% increase over last year.  So overall we are pleased with our gross margin performance, and our gross margin initiatives provide us the ability to maintain gross margin rates in spite of product mix and freight headwinds while continuing to provide great value to our customers.", "For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 26.2% of sales, reflecting a 32 basis point improvement from the prior year\u2019s quarter.  We are very pleased with our ability to leverage SG&A in light of our modest comp store growth with leveraging stemming from lower incentive compensation recorded in the quarter compared to the prior year.  We experienced strong payroll control as we continue to better allocate payroll to sales trends and medical expense trends were also favorable in the quarter.  These benefits were partially offset by de-leveraging from our distribution costs as we will not begin to cycle last year\u2019s opening of our Franklin, Kentucky DC until Q4.", "Our effective income tax rate decreased to 35.5% in Q3 compared to 36.7% last year.  The decrease was principally due to the favorable impact of our provision to return reconciliation and the reversal of tax reserve pursuant to FIN 48.  This was partially offset by lower federal tax credits, primarily WATSY, and higher credits that expired at the end of 2011.", "Turning to the balance sheet, at quarter end we had $78.6 million in cash compared to $118.5 million at the end of the same period last year.  During Q3 under our stock repurchase program we acquired approximately 681,000 shares for $61.3 million.  We estimate that the share repurchase program had an insignificant impact on EPS for the quarter.  ", "Average inventory levels per store at quarter end were approximately 2.1% higher than last year.  Year-to-date annualized inventory turns were 3.18x or 5 basis points better than last year.  We are very pleased with our ending inventory composition and our overall inventory productivity, especially given the embedded inflation and having one more distribution center than at this time last year.  We are comfortable with our quarter-end inventory level of seasonal merchandise as we exit the summer selling season.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $45.6 million as compared to $33.2 million last year.  We opened 17 stores in Q3 compared to 12 stores in Q3 of 2011.  We closed one store in the quarter in both this year and last year.  The increase in spend relates to the purchase of the future site for our store support center and cost related to the construction of our new Macon, Georgia distribution center, which is the relocation of our Southeastern DC in Braselton, Georgia.", "Turning to our outlook: as a result of our stronger-than-expected earnings performance in Q3 we are increasing our net income expectations for the full year 2012.  We now expect net income to be in the range of $3.63 to $3.69 per diluted share as compared to our previous guidance of $3.58 to $3.66 per diluted share.  We now expect full-year sales to range between $4.61 billion and $4.65 billion compared to our previous expectations of $4.58 billion to $4.65 billion.  Correspondingly, same store sales for the year are expected to be 4% to 5% compared to our prior expectations for an increase of 3.5% to 5%.", "I\u2019d like to quickly discuss a few of the specific drivers and underlying assumptions for the last quarter embedded in our full-year guidance.  Our guidance is based on the assumption that the retail environment will be stable.  We expect our customers will remain price-conscious and value-oriented and continue to shop our stores for basic and everyday needs as they did in the first nine months of 2012.  On a full-year basis, we expect to far exceed our annual EBIT margin improvement target of 20 basis points for the third consecutive year.  ", "With respect to Q4, we are again targeting 20 basis points of year-over-year EBIT margin improvement, principally through our key gross margin initiatives.  We do expect the freight and mix headwinds will continue into Q4 consistent with Q3 as fuel costs have edged back up and are now slightly higher than last year at this time, and we continue to drive CUE items that are slightly below chain average margin and freight-intensive.  As a reminder, we are cycling against a $2.7 million reserve for welding gas that negatively impacted Q4 last year.", "Although we recorded a one-time charge to SG&A last year of $3.2 million for the write off of certain ecommerce assets, it\u2019ll still be very difficult to leverage SG&A in Q4 based on our forecasted sales range as we are cycling the additional week from last year\u2019s 53-week calendar.  Therefore we believe that gross margin improvement will be the majority of the operating margin leverage in Q4.   Overall, we expect inflation impact of 1% to 2% in Q4 and we maintain our inflation forecast of 2% to 3% for the full year.", "For the full year we are now forecasting that our effective tax rate will be approximately 36.7%, an increase from 36.5% in 2011 and slightly lower than our previous guidance of 37.0%.  The increase from last year results principally from a reduction in expected federal tax credits and reduced ISO disqualifications relative to a higher taxable income base in the current year.  The slight improvement in the full-year tax rate results from the favorable adjustments I noted earlier that were recorded in Q3.", "We have essentially made no changes in our expected store growth rate or plans for capital spend.  We expect to open 93 stores which corresponds to our previously communicated range of 90 stores to 95 stores for 2012.  We project capital expenditures in 2012 will be at the high end of our previous range of $160 million to $170 million.  In addition to our planned expenditures of $11 million for the initial phase of construction for our Macon, Georgia DC relocation and an incremental $6 million as part of our ecommerce re-platforming, we will incur approximately $11 million on the land acquisition, initial permitting and grading expenses for our new store support center. ", "We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program as part of our long-term objective of reducing cost of capital and maintaining a targeted year-end cash balance of $100 million to $150 million. We currently project the full-year fully diluted shares outstanding calculation exclusive of any additional share repurchases throughout the remainder of the year would approximate 73 million shares.", "To conclude, we are very pleased with our performance in Q3 and the first nine months of 2012 overall, having delivered solid results on top of very strong comparisons.  We are proud that our initiatives are driving both top and bottom line increases and are very excited about the programs we have in place for the holiday selling season and believe Tractor Supply is well positioned for another record year in both sales and earnings.  And with that I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Greg.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you, Tony.  Regarding the current retail environment, consumers continue to act conservatively and are expecting to find compelling values in our stores during the holidays.  Purchases are being driven by necessity and are taking place much closer to the need.  We remain committed to our strategy of testing and improving our assortments.  ", "We are building a strong stable of exclusive brands across multiple categories to provide our customers with a value driven alternative to branded products without sacrificing quality.  This has been a highly successful strategy for us and we believe this will continue to strengthen customer satisfaction and longer-term loyalty to Tractor Supply.  Looking at the remainder of 2012 and the holiday selling season.  We believe we have the right plans in place for the holiday selling season and we are pleased with our overall inventory position supporting our key categories and initiatives.  ", "Before I turn the call over for questions I would like to take a moment on behalf of the Board and the entire Tractor Supply team to thank Jim Wright for his leadership over the past twelve years.  His strategic vision, dedication to our mission and values, and unwavering commitment for collaboration among all have been instrumental to Tractor Supply\u2019s success and our ability to implement our corporate strategy.", "As Jim noted earlier, he and I are completely aligned on Tractor Supply\u2019s business strategies and priorities for the future.  I look forward to continuing to work with Jim as our Executive Chairman, our Board of Directors and our strong management team.  As a team, we will continue to focus on our core strategies to capitalize on the opportunities we see for our business to maintain Tractor Supply\u2019s forward momentum.", "And with that, operator, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you.  (Operator instructions.)  And the first question will come from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays ", "Okay, thank you very much.  Jim, we wish you a very happy and healthy retirement as well.  With weather, between drought and the lack of cold weather really wreaking havoc on the business, are you at liberty to maybe tell us what the comp was in markets that had no weather impact in the quarter?  That\u2019s my first question.", "Tony Crudele", "Generally we don\u2019t get into that detail as far as the regional comps.  We would tell you that obviously comps range positive for almost every region and for the most part were below double digits.  So you had a span within the single digits for the general categories throughout the nation.", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays ", "Okay.  Secondly, with your import purchases continuing to grow at a double-digit rate, can you maybe just tell us where you think you are in that program and what at this point do you think can be the ultimate benefit to the EBIT margin line of that initiative?  And then I just have one last follow-up.", "Greg Sandfort", "Alan, this is Greg.  As far as our development within imports and what we see, we\u2019re still\u2026 I would say, if you put it in the baseball terminology that we like to use, we\u2019re probably in the third or fourth inning; quite a bit of room yet for us as we move through this cycle of not just conversion of product but building products that meet the specifications that our customers demand.  And that\u2019s probably more important than anything else, is giving them a much better value quality product at a reasonable price point.", "As far as what it\u2019s going to do for overall EBIT margins, we usually don\u2019t talk in specifics.  The one thing I will tell you is that on a direct import basis it\u2019s usually somewhere between 600 basis points to 800 basis points of improved margin over say a comparable national brand.", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays ", "Okay.  And one last one if I may: any significant change at all to your holiday setup this year versus last year?  Will you be bringing in the products earlier versus last year or how should we look at that?", "Greg Sandfort", "It\u2019s a great question and I will tell you that from the correction of error process that we have behind each season, last year we noted that our customers were asking us for the d\u00e9cor and the toy segment of holiday product.  They wanted it earlier in the stores.  They were willing to buy earlier, so we did make that change this year and move that up three weeks.  ", "We also have I would say an improved in-store environment.  We learned from a year ago that the North and the South have to be set a little differently, and what I mean by that is in the North where we\u2019ve got a lot of cold weather business we will move into the center court a lot of the insulated products and ancillary products \u2013 the heating and such; and we\u2019ll use the left-hand side of the store for the rest of seasonal and Christmas and holiday.  In the South it\u2019s just the opposite \u2013 the center court you\u2019ll see is set up with all the seasonal and Christmas and then cold weather\u2019s moved to the opposite side of the floor.", "And some of those changes last year were really tests to learn this year.  We\u2019re convinced that\u2019s going to make a big difference in the ease of shopping and the availability of product for our customers \u2013 so just a couple of things that we have done differently.", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays ", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert Baird", "Hi guys, thanks, and congratulations again to Jim.  Just can you remind us how last year\u2019s Q4 trended by month?  What were the toughest comparisons as you went through the quarter last year?", "Tony Crudele", "Sure Peter, this is Tony.  We generally had a very strong quarter throughout but we did start off the quarter last year with some dry cool weather, which drove October to be the strongest comp within those three months of that quarter.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert Baird", "Okay, when you said, Tony or Greg \u2013 I don\u2019t know who said it \u2013 but that October has so far gotten off to a trend that\u2019s better than what you were seeing before, is that better than September or better than what you did for Q3?", "Tony Crudele", "Well specifically we\u2019re targeting the winter season program.  Generally what we\u2019ve seen in the past is in the last couple weeks of September we will get cold snaps that will start to drive those sales; and as I had mentioned earlier we did not see that type of cold weather.  So that did present a drag as we experienced the sales in September.  As we moved into October and we had a nice cold snap during I want to say the first through the second week we saw a noticeable improvement in the sales of those winter categories.  So it was really specific to the winter categories \u2013 there had been a drag in September and we clearly saw them starting to turn around in an accelerated manner in October.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert Baird", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  And then when you think about the feed, can you talk about feed costs and pricing overall?  I know your inflation outlook for Q4 is kind of similar to what you\u2019ve been seeing, but with the drought and everything, some [of our checks] have indicated that there could be some renewed upward pressure on pricing within the feed category.  Can you tell us what you\u2019re seeing there?", "Greg Sandfort", "Yeah, Peter, it\u2019s Greg.  Feed prices and pet food prices have somewhat stabilized for the short term here.  There\u2019s a little movement in the futures market as we look at corn but it really hasn\u2019t worked its way back yet to our costs as an immediate change.  So we\u2019re looking at things being fairly stable through Q4 and you know, again \u2013 I don\u2019t have the crystal ball to tell you what it\u2019s going to look like beyond that point but pricing is fairly stable right now.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert Baird", "Okay, that\u2019s great.  And then Greg, just a follow-up on that: can you talk about the supply chain opportunities?  You mentioned some pressure from moving these bulky feed products around.  Can you talk about the [cross-docking tests] you\u2019ve got underway and kind of how you see that as you look out maybe the next year or two?  Is there an opportunity on supply chain for that to turn from a headwind to a tailwind?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, on the comment of the cross docks we have one in operation today and we are pleased with how it is performing.  And it is giving us the confidence that it appears that this may be the solution for us as we deal with this high bulk/high velocity but low value product, because as we all know the fewer times you handle it the more profitable that product is.  As far as in the future, we still have some more measurements to take on that so it\u2019ll be the early part of next year before I would tell you we are convinced that it\u2019s going to work properly; and at that point we\u2019ll be probably in a position to talk on the conference calls about the plans to take that forward.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert Baird", "Okay, fair enough.  Thanks very much.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Scott Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets.", "Scott Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Hey guys, Scott Ciccarelli.  Two questions: first of all, there\u2019s been a lot of questions recently just regarding the general health of the consumer out there and I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve noticed any changes in consumer behavior in terms of either how people are shopping or what they\u2019re shopping for, etc.", "Greg Sandfort", "Scott, it\u2019s Greg Sandfort.  I would tell you it\u2019s very consistent with what we\u2019ve seen for the last several years, particularly through the first three quarters of this year: buying closer to need, being very value-conscious, and still repairing versus buying new.  There\u2019s still a big emphasis on trying to extend the life of big ticket.", "Scott Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Alright, so no real change from what we\u2019ve seen earlier.", "Greg Sandfort", "", "No real change.", "Scott Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay.  And then the second portion was obviously we\u2019ve had these drought conditions, it\u2019s been a challenging environment, but do you feel like you faced a bigger challenge in Q2 or Q3 from the drought conditions?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well to be honest with you probably more Q2 than Q3 only because that\u2019s the quarter where you have a lot of outdoor power products and such that we would sell, and when there\u2019s a drought typically that business especially tends to get a little bit tougher because there\u2019s no grass to cut and so on and so forth.  But we managed through that and we found other things to sell, and what it does is it helps us understand that we\u2019re not reliant \u2013 we\u2019re not reliant on the category.  We can sell other things and this is where the [forged] piece kicked in and the feed piece kicked in, and some other categories that helped us offset.  So I would say it\u2019s between Q2 and Q3 with probably the most impact on drought but I\u2019d probably look more at Q2 due to the fact that we need the moisture to drive the growth of grass and other things in that OPE category.", "Scott Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll move next to Aram Rubinson with Nomura.", "Ed Ration \u2013 Nomura ", "Yes hi, it\u2019s Ed Ration for Aram \u2013 how are you?  I had one quick question on purchases.  We kind of backed into your purchases being up about 13.5% this year versus the same quarter last year, and I was just curious if there\u2019s anything behind the scenes that would change with respect to the timing of receipts or anything like that?  On a comp store basis that\u2019s up 4.3% which seems like a reasonable level but just wondering if there\u2019s any extra color there.  Thanks.", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, it\u2019s several things I guess we could talk to.  One is you have another DC in the mix so you\u2019re moving inventory to that DC.  You\u2019ve got the earlier delivery of d\u00e9cor, toys, and some of the seasonal products which also would have pushed receipts a little higher.  And as we said earlier in the call and in our comments the CUE business continues to drive positive units and positive costs.  So those three are probably the primary areas.", "Ed Ration \u2013 Nomura ", "Okay, great.  And then looking historically at the seasonality of the business and we\u2019ve taken to heart your point that you should look at the halves, but in the past it looked like about a 50/50 split between the first and the second half.  Is there anything you\u2019re seeing that would cause this year to move dramatically different from that?  Maybe I shouldn\u2019t say \u201cdramatically\u201d \u2013 is there anything moving it differently?", "Tony Crudele", "Ed, this is Tony.  Just looking at the first half we really had a tremendous lift in Q1, and that clearly is rare relative to past historical trends.  Now we do understand that there was some shift between the two quarters \u2013 Q1 and Q2 \u2013 but we do feel that the first half was an extremely strong performance.  So that may be outside of the norm.  ", "Additionally, you have to remember that last year was the 53-week year, so last year was (inaudible) by that additional week that continued that trend of having the back half a little bit stronger.  So I think coming into this year you would expect the back half to be a little bit less.  And as a reminder, last year we represented that we believed the last week represented about a $0.09 addition to EPS.", "Ed Ration \u2013 Nomura ", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to the next question from Vincent Sinisi with Bank of America.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you for taking my question, and Jim, congratulations to you and best of luck to you and Greg as you move into next year.  I wanted to ask on your SG&A you had some nice leverage on your comp number, especially up against a pretty difficult compare.  Was there anything to call out specifically there?  I know you mentioned some other personnel costs, incentive comp \u2013 anything though that\u2019s worth calling out for this quarter?", "Todd Crudele", "There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s significant.  We\u2019re definitely very pleased with our payroll control and we continue to leverage that, and as well as medical expense has been very favorable.  And that has been a little choppy throughout the year, however we have put programs in place over the last year and a half that we have seen overall trend to sort of maintain below our normal SG&A growth.  But other than that, really the driver behind it is the incentive comp and that is the reason why we were able to leverage in this quarter.  ", "And when we look at SG&A exclusive of the incentive compensation it had been running relatively flat on a year-over-year basis when you look at each quarter because each quarter does behave somewhat differently.  So on a per-store basis it is generally flat, and what we\u2019ve seen is that it will grow \u2013 again, exclusive of incentive comp \u2013 around the 9% to 10% range on a year-over-year basis.  So the wildcard is the incentive comp, and what really drives it is the sales level.", "So as we look at last year, since a good portion of our incentive compensation is based on sales for our team members out in the stores you can imagine last year with an 11.5% comp that drove some significant incentive compensation.  So there is some variability when it comes to sales level and the amount of incentive comp.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  And just as a follow-up, are there any updates regarding your CRM efforts?  I know that you guys are working on a \u201cFuture of Loyalty\u201d type of program.  Can we expect anything with that before we get into really the holiday season?  I know that you guys said you\u2019re bringing some of the inventory in for the holiday specifically in earlier \u2013 any updates there?", "Greg Sandfort", "Vincent, it\u2019s Greg.  No additional comments as far as a program being launched this fall.  We continue to do a lot of due diligence on what\u2019s the right program for Tractor Supply, and I would say that it\u2019s our intent that sometime in 2013 it\u2019s very possible we could be testing something out there to gain a read but nothing yet for the remainder of this fall.  We\u2019ve got many initiatives in place that I think will carry us through Q4 adequately.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, thanks very much.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Dan Wewer from Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Thanks.  Well Jim, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re entirely too young to retire?", "Jim Wright", "I do; my wife does not.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Call us in six months and let us know how it\u2019s going.", "Jim Wright", "Will do.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "I had a question on gross margin rate.  You noted that the growing sales contribution from CUE items negatively impacted margin by 15 bps.  Was the benefit from the declining sales contribution from OPE about the same \u2013 also 15 bps \u2013 so they washed each other out?", "Greg Sandfort", "Yeah, the amount \u2013 there were a few other factors, and I lumped all the big ticket together so there were some other considerations such as generators and all.  But it was in that range of 15 bps to 20 bps.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "I think there may be some that are surprised that a 10 basis point increase in freight expense would be enough to offset all of the tow-ins that you have on improving gross margin rate.  Do you think we\u2019ve achieved so much gross margin improvement the last three years that the rate of future gains may begin to slow?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well currently when we look at the potential of the gross margin initiatives we still think we have a nice runway ahead of us and we can continue to drive that.  Obviously we\u2019ve taken into consideration the potential headwinds from the mix as well as from some of the freight intensitiveness of some of the products, and weigh that against a potential.  But we think that we can continue to drive the sales.  As we look at the potential benefits of the four key margin initiatives we feel that we\u2019ve made substantial progress during this quarter, and again it gets masked somewhat because of the headwinds that we faced from the freight and the CUE items.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "And one other question that I have: there\u2019s a thesis that the housing markets are beginning to stabilize or in fact improve.  It\u2019s our view that there\u2019s a portion of your business that\u2019s also sensitive to housing activity.  Can you just update us on how much of your business you think is tied to the housing and what kinds of sensitivity may we see in terms of future sales growth if housing does in fact stage a comeback?", "Jim Wright", "Yeah, this is Jim.  As we look back to what we experienced starting in \u201908, the most direct correlation we have is riding lawn mowers and other OPE equipment \u2013 obviously most of it falls into big ticket.  And it\u2019s not just new housing starts; it\u2019s also housing mobility.  And while we\u2019re hearing that new houses are up a little bit, home sales are up a little bit, mobility has not kicked in to a degree that it\u2019s going to make a difference in our business.  ", "Should it return back to a more normal level of housing starts we would expect that we would benefit from the increased sales of new mover activity.  I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever broken out\u2026 Tony?", "Tony Crudele", "Yeah, when it comes to the categories that we perceive to be housing-related it represents about 6% to 7% of the business.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Oh that\u2019s helpful, okay.  Okay, great.  Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from John Lawrence with Stephens.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens ", "Good afternoon, guys.  Congratulations, Jim, and thanks for all your help over the years.  Greg, would you come in just a little bit, if you look at sort of going into Q4 and particularly private label such as Schmidt and RedStone, as you look at this holiday set compared to last year would there be a lot more?  I know you\u2019re always adding products but compared to what we saw in the first nine months, would there be an additional sort of ramp in extending those lines and those private label categories?", "Greg Sandfort", "John, you will see an expansion first of all in RedStone because we\u2019ve taken a little over 100 stores and put a much larger heating set into those stores.  This is something we tested a year ago called a Hearth Shop and it did quite well in the stores it was tested.  So that\u2019s one expansion.  You\u2019ll also see across the whole category in heating RedStone being a primary brand and that\u2019s a very consistent message for the customer.  ", "You\u2019ll also see in C.E. Schmidt some additional depth in the insulating categories and in what I would call the everyday use categories, whether it be in denim jeans or flannel shirts, things of that nature.  This is kind of work wear-related.  So yes, we are building out the brand even further and there\u2019s been some new footwear that\u2019s been placed into the assortments as well.  So we are building those two brans, yes.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens ", "Great, thanks.  And secondly, as you\u2019ve continued to build out the price op sort of modules, any real differences across categories that you could tell us about as time has marched on in that test; and any differences among the processes among categories?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, there\u2019s no question that hard lines act a little differently than soft lines, and feed acts a little bit differently than let\u2019s say our lubricants.  But let me kind of reiterate that this is a process that\u2019s iterative, so you know it\u2019s going to change.  You may work through a category today and come back again and visit it a year from now because of the dynamics in the market \u2013 whether it be cost inputs that you changed or consumer preference has shifted.  It\u2019s going to affect the elasticity and the way that we may price.", "The other thing that you\u2019ve got to consider is the competitive nature in some of these categories, and as I have said before there\u2019s three buckets we work in: there\u2019s the bucket for trying to find margin rate, there\u2019s the bucket for trying to drive market share, and then there\u2019s a bucket that has a blend.  So in general what I think I can tell you is that we\u2019re very cautious with this test and control methodology here at Tractor Supply.  We don\u2019t just turn the switch and let the system run.  There\u2019s always a test and control group that we work with to ensure that we\u2019re going to get the kind of result we expected before we roll this to the chain.", "Secondly, there\u2019s going to be differences between the regions \u2013 no question.  You can imagine the Northeast right now acting a little bit different than the South because we haven\u2019t had some of the weather situations in the North just yet.  So more specific to that, John, I can bury you with detail but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll add any value.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens ", "Great, congratulations and thanks for your help.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs.", "Matt Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks a lot and Jim, all the best to you as you move on; and Greg, I look forward to continuing to work with you.  Two questions really focused on gross margin: Tony, you cited the impact of the CUE products and their impact on mix as one of the factors keeping gross margin levels among many others I guess.  Is that mix shift element and the consumables business and its strength any different than it\u2019s been in prior quarters or should we just view this as a continuation of that long run trend?", "Tony Crudele", "Matt, I would look at it as a continuation.  We\u2019ve experienced this headwind as we\u2019ve accelerated our business in those lines and we would expect\u2026 Again, each quarter varies slightly but as we continue to drive that business we\u2019ll continue to have that very similar headwind.", "Matt Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "If I were to take a step back and look at the past four quarters from a gross margin perspective three of them have been essentially flat, and there\u2019ve been I guess some kind of freakish events or weather circumstances that have contributed to that.  If you thought about the next four quarters in aggregate, the initiatives that you have \u2013 taking weather out of the picture and knowing what your drivers are \u2013 would you think that the gross margin would probably have a better year-on-year trajectory or is this the kind of 20 basis point, 25 basis point run rate on an annualized basis that you would anticipate?", "Tony Crudele", "Matt, generally we always default back to our sort of standard pro forma which is we\u2019re looking to grow the base of 8% and drive EBIT margin of 20 basis points.  So that\u2019s really our goal.  We understand that the years in which sales are very strong we\u2019re going to get some leverage on SG&A but for the most part we expect to drive a 20 basis point improvement in EBIT margin with the majority of that coming from the gross margin initiatives.", "Matt Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it.  And then just one final follow-up: once you start to leverage the Kentucky DC how much of a weight does that take off margins as you think about whatever pressure it\u2019s driven year-to-date?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well Matt, the impact on margins is going to be in the [stem aisle] savings because of where that DC is located and its capabilities.  So it\u2019s going to fall on that side of the house.  The building is still not at full capacity yet and that\u2019s a good thing because we built it large enough and it\u2019s got enough stores being pushed through it, so there\u2019ll be some advantages yet but it\u2019ll be more I think on when we look at the distribution/transportation side.", "Matt Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it.  Thank you guys.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yes, good evening guys.  So I guess no one has said congratulations to Steve [Barber] yet tonight so I\u2019ll do that right now.  [laughter]  ", "Greg Sandfort", "Steve\u2019s actually travelling.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "There you go, okay.  So just to go back to the gross margin question for a minute, and relative to I guess Scott\u2019s question about the impact of drought on Q2 and Q3 \u2013 would you say that the change in gross margin trajectory between Q2 and Q3 was due to the fact that one, you have more consumables business in this quarter and then secondly the favorable impact of the higher-margin drought was not as beneficial this quarter as last quarter?  It just seems that the impact of CUE is not too dissimilar and yet the margins slowed pretty significantly sequentially.", "Tony Crudele", "We definitely have an increase in the mix of the freight intensive CUE items in Q3 so that really was one of the biggest drivers.  Also the pull forward in Q1 as we moved some of the big ticket riding lawn mowers into Q1 helped Q2 when it came to its margin.  So yeah, there\u2019s always going to be some plusses and minuses as we go through each quarter and but those two explanations probably drive the majority of the difference in performance between Q2 and Q3.", "", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay.  And then as you look back over the last nine months, would it be safe to say, I mean from my perspective you guys only really had one month of favorable weather \u2013 that being March; and then the other months were actually pretty unfavorable?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well they were challenging, I\u2019ll say that.  This has not been a typical year but regardless of weather we still have to find a way to do business, right?  And we do \u2013 we find a way to sell the products that our consumers continue to want.  So yeah, it\u2019s been a tough year from a weather standpoint.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and then just lastly could we just go back over\u2026 I know there were a couple puts and takes in the gross margin of Q4 last year.  You had the welding gas charge and then also some early discounting on winter merchandise.  Can you remind us what the basis points impact was of the discounting?", "Tony Crudele", "That I don\u2019t have handy.  I want to say that it\u2019s going to be probably less than 20 basis points when it comes to management and we did have a significant freight expense increase last year that I think was\u2026 If I can recollect it was close to 40 basis points.  So we would not expect that type of a headwind from freight as the freight expense and diesel is similar to last year.  So net-net between the two there was clearly an offset last year.  We would expect that there would be some headwind from the freight as we\u2019d talked about earlier as well as the mix, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be quite as dramatic as the freight impact from last year.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, very good.  Thanks guys.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Mark Miller with William Blair.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "Hi, good afternoon.  The benefits you had in lower incentive comp, Tony, I think you were suggesting that maybe that was the majority of the expense leverage you got.  So is that in the $4 million favorable range year-to-year, about $0.04 to EPS?", "Tony Crudele", "It was a little bit less than that.  It was probably more in the $0.02 to $0.03 range.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "Okay.  And then how about the other one-time items you called out \u2013 lower medical costs?  Were those considered in your prior EPS outlook and also the tax rate?  So in other words, as you raise the EPS outlook how much of that is coming from any of these items?", "Tony Crudele", "When we look at the quarter the payroll management and the medical expense they were not as significant; and when we look at the entire year a little bit of a driver from the payroll performance throughout the entire year, probably not as significant in Q3.  The main driver of the SG&A improvement, and I say \u201cmain driver\u201d but I would say significantly the entire portion of the SG&A leverage came from the incentive compensation.", "So as we look at the forecast we really felt very good about the sales level that we had anticipated because we understood that we were going up against an extremely strong comp in Q3 last year.  So we felt very good about that as well as margin.  In fact, as we went though it we were ahead in probably each category \u2013 slightly above performance in sales, slightly above performance in margins, slightly above performance on the SG&A.  So it was a combination of several factors that drove us to raise our full-year expectations.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "And the tax rate as well or had you contemplated that?", "Tony Crudele", "The tax rate was a benefit that was above our expectations, that was approximately $0.01.  And but we did exceed our internal expectations by, at a minimum and excluding the tax impact, by the increase in our guidance.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "Okay, great.  And then I was hoping to get some perspective around the increase in the import orders.  So I think if my numbers are right in Q2 those were up 16% and in Q3 up 7%, and I imagine that could be impacted by the timing of when you want to inventory certain items.  But was there any timing there that impacted that or I guess can you broadly comment on sell through of import items versus your plan?  And are there any items that are just not moving as quickly as you had maybe thought perhaps due to weather?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, that\u2019s a good question.  I would tell you a couple things on imports.  Depending upon the category the lead times are what you have to consider here but thus far in the fall season we\u2019re very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing as far as sales in the direct import products.  Now remember, I mentioned earlier that we deliver a lot of these products in early- to mid-Q3, many of these pushing into Q4 for the all-important holiday season and gift giving.", "But at this point I can\u2019t tell you that there\u2019s anything we\u2019re displeased with.  We understand the weather impact right now and we\u2019re very patient with that because the weather will come and we\u2019re not concerned.  It will come, and we\u2019re not at this point in time at any risk to say that we\u2019ve got more inventory in the stores than we need at this point.  We\u2019re waiting for those allocations based upon sales.  So as sales come we\u2019ll allocate the product and push it out of distribution centers but the big shift I guess from Q3 to Q4 as far as sales is you have to come.", "Tony Crudele", "And I would tell you that we\u2019re basically dealing with a little bigger base when we go into Q3 as we in the past have had relatively high imports as we go into Q4.  So that is one of the reasons why you probably don\u2019t see as significant of an increase year-over-year.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "Okay, thanks so much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll move next to Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Brad Thomas \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thanks, good afternoon \u2013 let me add my best as well to you, Greg and Jim. I wanted to just ask about performance of new stores.  It\u2019s kind of an imperfect metric for us to grade from the outside but our calculations suggest a little bit of a slowdown in that metric for Q3.  Anything in particular going on with timing or maybe the mix of stores in terms of the smaller format that might have affected that?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, this is Greg.  Let me just quickly say that the new store performance is on par with what we\u2019ve seen through the first two quarters and actually in Q3 this year.  So we\u2019re not seeing any deceleration in the performance.  And I think I mentioned this in the last call that we developed a new launch platform for the new stores with a marketing area that is really helping us accelerate the business and get those stores off to a much faster start.  So we\u2019re very pleased with those performances right now.", "Brad Thomas \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Great.  And then as we think about the contribution, the delta between your comp and your top line \u2013 would you expect that to start to shrink a little bit as you start to open stores that are in the smaller format over the next few years?", "Jim Wright", "Not really.  The mix between the formats, it might be that 10% of the base might be in smaller markets but it shouldn\u2019t be significant.  And again, as Greg has mentioned the performance of the new stores has done very well and they, I want to say almost in every case exceed the target sales levels that we had laid out for each one of those stores.", "Brad Thomas \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Perfect, I appreciate the clarification.  Thanks so much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Credit Suisse.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks, and congratulations Jim and Greg.  A quick question on CUE, on the CUE area \u2013 can you talk about how the product margin in that category has trended?  Have there been any meaningful changes within it?  And then besides private label is there anything you can do to enhance that margin over time, maybe as you get bigger with certain suppliers?", "Greg Sandfort", "The product margin in CUE has remained fairly stable.  It moves with some of the commodity shifts that we\u2019ll see but in general, we manage those shifts with inflation and deflation.  As far as any advantage going forward based upon scale and size that we may be able to have some influence, there\u2019s no question that we\u2019re always working with our manufacturers and suppliers to talk about size and usage product, and in many cases we can gain some benefit.  But it can be highly volatile when there\u2019s inflation and deflation is all I can tell you but we have a very concise program on how we manage that.  So we take every advantage, believe me, of using our size and scale to try to drive cost down.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "But I guess to your point before of it being I guess high touch but low value, is there a lot to really extract out of it?  Is it an area that you\u2019re really focused on or it might be a minor benefit if you see something over time?", "Greg Sandfort", "The place that we\u2019re focusing on today is the actual movement of that product, and that\u2019s why we talked about the cross-dock centers earlier.  Your largest expense is really your freight, and so we are working diligently to find a better solution to bring to Tractor Supply in handling that piece of the business.  And at the same time as we are gaining and growing market share, our costs should probably be a little more advantageous than say a much smaller retailer that\u2019s purchasing quite a bit less.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay.  And then one follow-on I guess regarding CUE: you mentioned the forage program and my apologies if someone asked this \u2013 I admit I didn\u2019t get every question.  Can you just talk about some of the traditional CUE [pay versus some of the bagged]?  I\u2019m curious as to how each are performing.  And then is it bringing new customers to the store or is it adding to the basket of existing?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, there\u2019s two parts of the forage program.  There\u2019s the outside piece that we\u2019ve been talking a lot about recently and that\u2019s the two-string, the three-string and the rolled hay bale.  That\u2019s one piece.  There\u2019s also an inside piece that is the packaged product that we sell that\u2019s a compressed product that sells inside the store.  The in-store piece, those carry a little higher margin than the outside store piece, and I would say to you that what it\u2019s done is it\u2019s helped us round out the tickets for the consumer.  ", "In the past when we didn\u2019t have these programs in place they may have come to us for their feed but they didn\u2019t buy the other components; they\u2019d have to still go to some other place, some other store.  Today we have become that one-stop destination where they can fulfill all those needs and we are seeing the market basket growing.  As the customer\u2019s buying the feed product we\u2019re seeing some of the other forage products accompanying that, and that was the whole goal behind that.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take the next question from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Good afternoon.  I just had a quick question on the gross margin in Q4.  Assuming that the 25 basis point headwind from mix and freight is fairly persistent, how would you rank the offsets to that that take gross margin up enough to drive EBIT margin expansion?  For example, how much benefit do you think you\u2019ll see from cycling the Franklin opening?", "Tony Crudele", "The Franklin opening would be down in SG&A because we do not allocate the distribution center operating costs to gross margin.  And we would anticipate there\u2019s a potential for possibly 5 basis points of improvement there, so it\u2019s fairly limited when it comes to Q4 because as Greg had mentioned earlier, we really need to drive the productivity in that new facility.", "And then of course we can get positive contribution from the mix depending on the big ticket sales, and generally what we would anticipate is some increase there.  And then when it comes to the four key gross margin initiatives, we feel very good about how we\u2019ve been driving that business.  The markdown management was really one of the main drivers in this Q3 and we expect as we enter into Q4 that our inventory position is in very good shape, so we expect to be able to manage through that.", "As far as optimization, it contributed very nicely in Q3 as well and we have a really nice import line which we have brought in relatively early this quarter and expect to have some benefit there as well.  So it\u2019s difficult to rate all three or four of those gross margin initiatives and combining with the mix impact I think we can really drive performance and exceed any of the margin headwinds that we would encounter.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "That\u2019s helpful; that helps lay it out for us.  And then secondly, given the drought that we\u2019ve had \u2013 and you may have already hit on this \u2013 but what\u2019s your outlook for inflation over the next couple of quarters into the beginning of 2013?", "Tony Crudele", "We haven\u2019t looked out into Q1 yet \u2013 we like to reserve that as being a little bit closer.  But this last quarter we were at 185 basis points and we expect to range between the 100 basis points and 200 basis points again this quarter.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great.  Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group.", "Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Yeah, hi, good afternoon guys.  Thanks for taking my questions.  Most of mine have been answered but I did want to ask you about as you think about Q4, and I know you sort of addressed it in different chunks of the call but I guess where do you guys worry about the potential pitfalls in the quarter or the potential upside in the quarter that could come out of this?", "Jim Wright", "Well, there\u2019s a couple things we don\u2019t worry about and one is CUE.  CUE continues to drive, continues to perform and we believe that we have our hands around that business.  I think the biggest issue we\u2019re going to have for Q4, if there\u2019s an issue at all is when the weather might come and help us in the seasonal products.  It\u2019s going to come \u2013 it\u2019s just when.  You know, is it middle of November?  Like we had, for example, on Halloween a year ago in the Northeast we had a snowstorm.  That was a wonderful thing that helped kick the business off but I can\u2019t predict that this year.  ", "So what I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve kept my inventories very tight, very pointed, very focused.  My vendor community is sitting out there with product waiting if I need it, and if I don\u2019t need it then I don\u2019t need it.  But I think that\u2019s probably the only thing that I\u2026 And it\u2019s not really a concern because we manage our inventory so differently today than we did in the past.  There\u2019s an upside, and the upside is if the weather breaks and we get some opportunities we can push inventory into the stores very quickly; we\u2019re very good at that.  Our supply chain is a well-oiled machine at this point from that standpoint and we can take advantage of it and drive sales.  So it\u2019s a little bit of a waiting game.", "Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful.  Thank you.  And then just one other question, and you sort of addressed it in the prepared remarks but I guess where weather was a little more seasonal were the trends dramatically different in sales or was it just moderately different in sales?  Like I don\u2019t know if you can size it at all for us.", "Tony Crudele", "It\u2019s tough to come to some conclusions because of the different weather patterns.  For example, as we cycled the drought in Texas from last year we had a significant comp \u2013 we were high single digits in that region.  As we cycled against Hurricane Irene up in the Northeast we experienced the weakest comp.  So the weather variables were so dramatic that it\u2019s difficult to sort of isolate it and encapsulate it into sort of one generalization across the nation.  ", "But we do feel very strongly that in particular as we enter Q4, that if the cold weather comes we\u2019ll be very well positioned as well as last year was one of the warmest winters December through February that we had experienced in many, many years.  So we\u2019re optimistic that the cooler weather will take over.  The forecasts show a relatively warm winter again but potentially cooler than last year.", "Greg Sandfort", "The other thing that we have an advantage in is with the composition of stores now across the country, this is how weather kind of dissipates.  We may have ideal weather in one part of the country and less favorable in another, but the mix of all is what we\u2019ve been able to really use as a strength of ours because of our ability to move within the supply chain and push products where they\u2019re needed.  ", "As an example take the drought a year ago \u2013 we took advantage of that.  This year we had drought in many other parts of the country and we continued to shift; last year it was kind of consolidated as Tony said in Texas.  So because of the dispersion of stores we have a little bit of an advantage and a little bit I guess of some, I would say a little bit of an offset to what might happen in one particular region or another.", "Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful guys.  Thanks and good luck with this quarter.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll move next to Chris Horvers with JP Morgan.", "Chris Horvers \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thanks, good evening.  So I was just trying a little bit more on the monthly trends side, not to beat a dead horse but thinking about last  year and you mentioned Irene \u2013 how do the comparisons play out in Q3 last year?  On an adjusted basis you did a 7.1% in Q2 and then 11.9% and then we fell off and went back to a lower trend, so kind of when did we come over that hump?  Did that show up in September because of Irene or how should we think about that?", "Tony Crudele", "Well, last year in Q3 September was the strongest comp although all three months were double digit comps last year, with September being the strongest.  So as we entered this quarter we expected that September would be the weakest.  We also mentioned last year on the conference call that Irene represented about a 1% impact overall to the comp for the quarter, so you can imagine that it had a fairly significant impact on the September numbers.", "Chris Horvers \u2013 JP Morgan", "That\u2019s very helpful.  And then as you think about how that math would play out, was September still positive?  And then related to that, did the CUE category show any variability, any significant variability on the monthly basis as well?", "Tony Crudele", "CUE was very consistent throughout the quarter, and again as I had mentioned earlier it was really high single digits but in sales and units.  So we\u2019re very pleased with the performance, and again, it drives the footsteps and is one of the key reasons why we have 18 consecutive quarters of transaction growth.  When you look at September it was a positive comp; and the other thing that I would like to reiterate is that last year we had some significant inflation as we moved into the back half of the year and in particular Q3 was impacted almost 500 basis points of inflation whereas this year it was down to 185 basis points.  ", "So between the hurricane and the inflation, we understood coming into the quarter that they would be a very tough comparison; and that\u2019s why we come away very pleased and it actually exceeded our internal expectations and gave us the opportunity to increase our outlook for the year.", "Chris Horvers \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thanks very much, and good luck, Jim and Greg.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up from Peter Benedict.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert Baird", "Hi guys, just one more \u2013 sorry the call dragged on here.  Just, Tony, on the 20 basis points that you had [margin planned] for Q4 is that off of last year\u2019s reported 9% or were you thinking about that off an adjusted 13-week number from last year?  Thanks.", "Tony Crudele", "That is off of last year\u2019s reported number, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re targeting.  And our Merchandise Group was tasked and put a plan together that can get us there.  And also we\u2019re hopeful \u2013 as much as we think it will be a struggle to drive some SG&A benefit we\u2019re hopeful that we can drive some SG&A leverage as we manage the expenses and some of the expense trends that we see as we enter the quarter.  But we really do think that the majority of the EBIT margins improvement will come from gross margins.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert Baird", "Okay, perfect.  Thank you.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions.  Please continue with any closing comments.", "Jim Wright", "Okay, thank you Operator.  Thank you all very much for participating on today\u2019s call.  Let me just make a few comments here, that in the past few years Tractor Supply has operated more effectively than at any time in its history.  This is best demonstrated by the fact that we\u2019ve had 18 consecutive quarters of comp transaction count increases; 15 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth; 12 consecutive quarters of comp sales increases; and 11 consecutive quarters of expense leverage.", "We know and we understand our customer and our more than 17,000 knowledgeable and very motivate Tractor Supply team members work very hard every day to provide exceptional customer service.  Surveys indicate that our customers appreciate the level and consistency of our service and we are honored that they continue to reward us with their increased loyalty.  We continue to demonstrate our ability to manage the controllable and operate our business effectively despite the uncontrollable, whether it\u2019s the economy, inflation, or weather.", "We appreciate your continued interest and support of Tractor Supply and we look forward to speaking to you again after the holidays.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today.

(Operator Instructions)", "Please be advised that reproduction of this call in whole or in part is not permitted without prior written authorization of Tractor Supply Company.  And as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Jennifer Milan of FTI Consulting.  Please go ahead, Jen.", "Jennifer Milan", "Thank you, operator.  Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.

Greg, please go ahead.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you, Jen, and good afternoon, everyone.  I\u2019m delighted to be speaking with you today in my new role as Chief Executive Officer after what has been a very smooth transition between Jim Wright and myself.  With me today is Tony Crudele, our CFO.", "We are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year performance, which underscores the continued strengths of our business.  Our teams are performing exceptionally well in what remains a very challenging retail environment.  And our attention to our customers\u2019 changing needs has never been more focused.", "Each quarter in 2012 we made progress in the areas of new merchandise offerings, refinement of our regional assortments, supply chain efficiencies and management of our inventory, all of which are contributing to our continued growth and profitability.", "Now let me discuss in little more detail some particulars regarding our fourth quarter results.  In terms of specific sales drivers, two categories \u2013 the consumable, usable, edible part of our business \u2013 remains very strong and was a key component in driving both traffic and sales.", "We are increasing our market share in these categories and are becoming in the minds of our customers the most dependable supplier for their need-based products.  We also remain very focused on keeping our customers highly engaged with the Tractor Supply brand by providing newness to product innovation.", "We continue to see a high level of sales and profit performance from our exclusive brands with mix at roughly 24% of sales, up 150 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter.", "Our immediate plans are to continue expansion of these exclusive brands through brand extension.  And because these brands can only be purchased at Tractor Supply, this will ensure Tractor Supply will achieve the product differentiation from other farm store competition and internet retailers.", "Pet food and animal feed continue to generate solid results in the fourth quarter and remain important drivers of repeat footsteps in our stores.  As an example, EquiStages, our exclusive brand of equine feed introduced about 10 months ago, continues to perform well within our mix of feed due to number one brand positioning, secondly, quality of ingredient and, third, the value price proposition it offers versus the national brand comparative.", "Our forage business continues to build momentum as we expanded the program to more stores this past year.  We exceeded our goal of 600 stores by year-end, ending the year with 750 stores with forage product.", "This effort required a tremendous amount of hard work and diligence on the part of our buying teams and is another excellent example of how TSC is meeting our customers\u2019 core needs through extension of offerings within an established category, this namely being feed.", "In the quarter, we experienced a small sales benefit from Hurricane Sandy, which directly drove sales of emergency related merchandise.  But more importantly, we are extremely proud of our Northeastern store teams, our distribution team members at our (Hagerstown), Maryland facility and across our entire distribution center network who worked selflessly and tirelessly to support their communities in their time of need.", "I also want to express my sincere appreciation to those in our vendor community who worked side by side with our teams in our store support center to obtain inventory quickly so that we could assist those most in need following the storm.", "Such efforts as these to go above and beyond to meet our customers\u2019 needs in a crisis exemplify the teamwork culture at Tractor Supply.  I believe this is one of many reasons for our continued improvement in our customer loyalty scores and, in fact, on a year-over-year basis we improved our scores every month in 2012 and ended the year with a record customer loyalty score across all regions within the company.", "Weather conditions for the quarter for sales of cold weather products remained less than ideal, however.  And as in the past, our team again successfully managed through these unfavorable variables and delivered growth in comp store sales and another double digit increase in profitability on top of a strong fourth quarter a year ago.", "Our effective management of inventory through the quarter is another milestone achievement.  I\u2019m convinced this was accomplished in part because of the many structural changes we now have embedded into our daily operation.", "Our team has done an outstanding job managing inventory levels and, most importantly, we ended 2012 with our fall winter carryover inventory well below a year ago.", "So let me conclude my remarks by stating that I am delighted with our team\u2019s ability to adapt our business to changing conditions while still driving improved profitability.", "Operationally, we made great strides on our key strategic initiatives and this progress has yielded sustainable improvement for our business.", "As we look to 2013, we have never been more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.  I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tony to review our financial results and discuss our 2013 outlook.  I will return following his remarks to share my closing comments.", "Tony Crudele", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone.  For the quarter ended December 29, 2012, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 10.8% to $1.29 billion when you adjust for the one additional week we had in our fourth quarter last year.", "Correspondingly, net income grew by approximately 24% to $79.5 million or $1.11 per diluted share adjusted for that additional week.", "As a reminder, this year\u2019s fourth quarter consisted of 13 sales weeks compared to 14 weeks last year as our fiscal 2011 was a 53-week year.", "We achieved these strong results despite a warm winter season and being up against robust sales growth last year.  Comp store sales, which is the more relevant measure, increased 4.7% for the fourth quarter compared to last year\u2019s increase to 7.1% adjusted for the one-week calendar shift.", "Comp transaction count increased for the 19th consecutive quarter gaining 2.7% on top of a 3.6% increase last year.  We are very pleased with the core business as two products, specifically animal feed and pet, continued to serve our customers\u2019 basic and functional needs and drive transaction count increases.", "The trended average comp ticket continued to be positive at 1.8% versus last year\u2019s 3.8% increase.  The impact of this inflation was approximately 165 basis points for the quarter, which was within our projected range of 100 to 200 basis points but significantly less of a benefit than last year\u2019s estimated 500 basis points.", "Big ticket merchandise performed consistent with company\u2019s overall comp sales increase and had a favorable impact on comp ticket of approximately 30 basis points.  Big ticket was bolstered by Hurricane Sandy emergency response sales, such as generators, but this benefit was moderated by negative trends in sales of winter goods such as snow blowers and log splitters due to the unseasonably warm winter.", "Other key notes regarding the quarter, we did an excellent job of managing through the variable weather conditions throughout the country, particularly those impacted by Hurricane Sandy.", "On a regional basis, all regions had positive comp sales.  Sales were the strongest in the southwest and southeast as moisture conditions were favorable in these regions and the seasonal business was less impacted by the warm weather.", "Comp sales trends were generally consistent by month throughout the quarter.  We did end the quarter on a very strong note as holiday sales kicked in and comp sales benefitted this year from the additional holiday shopping weekend between Thanksgiving and Christmas.", "Emergency response, including Hurricane Sandy, had a modestly positive impact on comp sales, which we estimate to be approximately 30 basis points for the quarter.  We did not suffer a significant number of lost sales days and we are proud of our team members for showing tremendous dedication in supporting their communities with many sacrificing to open stores and going above and beyond to serve customers in their time of need.", "Turning now to gross margin, which as a percent of sales increased by 50 basis points to 33%, we continued to benefit from our key gross margin initiatives, which are price optimization, strategic sourcing, exclusive brands and mark down management.  These initiatives combined with strong merchandise leadership yielded significant improvement in direct product margin rate.", "This improvement more than compensated for the negative impact of the continued mix shift to key products which have a margin rate lower than chain average.", "Freight increased approximately 13 basis points partially offsetting the product margin benefit we experienced in the quarter.  This increase in freight is principally as a result of the cost related to increased import activity of seasonal goods and the mix shift to freight intensive key products.", "Big ticket sales did not have a significant impact on gross margin rate during the fourth quarter.  Although the sales of lower margin emergency response products were higher due to Hurricane Sandy, the unfavorable margin impact was offset by softness in sales of other winter related merchandise such as snow blowers and log splitters, which also carry lower than chain average margin.", "We did have an easier margin comparison in the fourth quarter as we took a $2.7 million charge last year for the exit of our welding gas program from several hundred stores.  This represented 20 basis points of the year-over-year improvement.", "Import purchases in the quarter accounted for 9.6% of total purchases, which represents 11.7% increase year-over-year.  Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the gross margin performance during the fourth quarter and that our gross margin initiatives provide us with the ability to maintain gross margin rate in spite of product mix and freight headwinds while continuing to provide great values to our customers.", "For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, was 23.3% of sales reflecting 20 basis points of improvement for the prior year\u2019s quarter.  We are extremely pleased with our field and store payroll cost controls and ability to leverage SG&A in the quarter, especially since last year\u2019s quarter had an additional selling week as a result of the 53-week year in 2011.", "We had estimated that the additional week last year had a favorable impact of approximately 15 basis points.", "We did book adjustments last year in Q4 related to the write down of certain ecommerce assets which made the comparison easier by 26 basis points.  Incentive compensation was less than last year as well.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with $147 million in cash, meeting our year-end target of $100 million to $150 million.", "During the fourth quarter under a stock repurchase program, we acquired approximately 1.21 million shares for $108 million.  We estimated the share repurchase program had a slightly less than $0.01 impact on EPS for the quarter.", "Average inventory levels per store at year-end increased just under 1% compared to last year.  The rate of increase was well below our estimated inflation rate and we are comfortable with our year-end inventory levels of seasonal merchandise.", "As a result of our strong inventory management, inventory turns for the year improved to 3.28 times, or five basis points better than last year.", "Capital expenditures for the year were $153 million as compared to $166 million last year.  We opened 25 stores in the fourth quarter compared to 31 stores in the fourth quarter of 2011.", "Our capital spend is generally consistent with the prior year but below our expectations that would be at the high end of our forecasted range of $160 million to $170 million.", "While our projects remain on target, anticipated expenditures around our southeast DC relocation, the construction of our new store support center and certain IT projects shifted into 2013.", "So turning our attention to 2013, we expect full-year sales to range from $5.07 billion to $5.17 billion.  We have forecasted comp sales to increase between 3% and 5%.  We are targeting improvement approximately 10 to 20 basis points in EBIT margin compared to 2012 with the majority coming from gross margin as a result of several of our key merchandising initiatives.", "We anticipate net income to range from approximately $304 million to $310 million or $4.32 to $4.40 per diluted share and we expect to open 100 to 105 new stores with approximately 50% to 55% opened in the first half of the year.", "As we\u2019ve emphasized in the past, we believe our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the halves, not the quarters, as weather patterns can change significantly from year to year and shift the timing of the sales.", "It is particularly important to keep this in mind as you look at the first half of 2013 as we had an early spring last year and we estimated we pulled approximately $38 million forward into Q1 from Q2.", "Let me discuss some of the more specific drivers and assumptions that helped us form our projections for 2013.", "Although the consumer will continue to be concerned about the ongoing high unemployment and the impact of higher payroll tax on their take-home pay, we do not expect that the current retail environment will change dramatically.", "Although there was some positive and negative weather events in 2012, such as the hurricane activity and the drought in the Midwest, we believe it was a net neutral year from a weather perspective, therefore, we do not anticipate the cycling against last year\u2019s weather trends will have a significant impact on a year-over-year results in 2013 other than the potential shift to sales between Q1 and Q2 as I previously mentioned.", "We expected the inflationary impact will be approximately 1% to 2% for the year and that we\u2019ll be at the higher end of the range in the first half of the year and slightly less in the second half of the year.", "The increase in EBIT margin is net of an approximate $6.5 million to $8 million headwind or $0.06 to $0.07 EPS drag that we anticipate to incur as we relocate our southeast distribution center and our store support data center.", "These costs include duplicate occupancy expense while we transition facilities, temporary labor during the transition, freight movement costs between facilities and equipment depreciation.", "These costs will be principally reflected in SG&A with the majority of the expense occurring in Q2 and Q3.", "For the full year, we expect net gross margin rate expansion of approximately 10 to 15 basis points.  We expect to achieve our gross margin rate improvement through the execution of our key gross margin initiatives.", "These initiatives will provide us the ability to overcome an estimated gross margin headwind of approximately 10 to 15 basis points from the continuing mix shift to our key products which carry a below chain average margin rate.", "We also expect freight costs to remain a headwind as we experience deleverage from the merchandise mix shift to more freight intensive key products.  Additionally, (stem) miles per store will increase slightly as we continue to open new stores in the west.", "In terms of cadence, we expect gross margin percent will be flat to slightly down in the first half of the year with improvement weighted more to the second half based on our forecasted merchandise mix, our initiatives continue to drive value and cycling softer margin comparison in Q3.", "Inventory turns are expected to improve slightly.  We would expect per-store inventories to increase modestly, consistent with investments and key merchandise categories and inflation.", "We may experience slightly higher inventory levels at the end of Q2 as we transition to our southeast distribution center.", "With respect to SG&A, exclusive of DC and datacenter charges I discussed previously, we continue to target our SG&A growth to leverage at 3% comp and to manage our business accordingly.", "Store support center and store payroll is expected to leverage slightly as we grow our comp sales base and cycle a more normalized level of incentive compensation which should offset wage and healthcare increases.", "Some key points with respect to the quarters, remember that Q1 last year was unseasonably warm, which resulted in reduced expenses of approximately $1.5 million related to snow removal and utilities.", "With respect to the datacenter \u2013 the distribution center and datacenter relocation, we estimate that the majority of the expense will be incurred in Q2 and Q3.  We\u2019ll be cycling Hurricane Sandy in Q4 and, as in the past, we will provide more color regarding our expectations for the subsequent periods at each quarterly conference call.", "For the full year, we forecasted our effective tax rate will be approximately 36.5%, consistent with 2012.  Due to the timing of certain tax incentives that were reinstated on January 1, 2013, these incentives will be treated as a discrete tax item in Q1 and we have estimated a favorable impact on Q1 tax rate of approximately 100 to 120 basis points.", "We plan to have a significant increase in capital expenditures in 2013 with a range of approximately $240 million to $250 million for the full year as we complete the construction of our southeast distribution center and begin construction on our new store support center scheduled to be completed in 2014.", "We expect store growth and general maintenance capital to increase slightly to approximately $110 million to $112 million.  We also have allocated approximately $130 million as a place holder for our elite store acquisition program and potentially four self-developed store projects.", "We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program as part of our long-term objective of reducing our cost of capital and maintaining a target cash balance of $100 million to $150 million.", "For modeling purposes, we estimate that the diluted shares outstanding inclusive of option grant and share repurchase activity will approximate $71 million for the full year.  Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Greg for more details on our plans for 2013.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you, Tony.  Regarding the retail environment, we have seen very little change from recent quarters regarding our customers\u2019 purchasing behaviors.  Our consumers are spending conservatively and are seeking out compelling values.", "Purchases are being driven by necessity and are taking place much closer to need.  Today, Tractor Supply is responding more quickly to the opportunities within our business and we make an effort every day to understand and anticipate the changing needs and wants of our customers.", "Our ability to respond quickly to shifting customer demand has contributed to our performance and will continue to drive our sales in the coming year.", "Looking ahead to the spring selling season, although there could be a shift in sales between the quarters, as Tony commented earlier, we are confident that we have the right plans in place to drive improved results and are pleased with our overall inventory position as we enter spring.", "Our customers will see newness across the store, which we believe they expect from us and will, in turn, will purchase from us.  The teams remain relentlessly focused on improved execution throughout the business and believe we have considerable opportunity ahead to increase our market share.", "As we continue to expand our footprint in key regions, we remain very comfortable with our annual square footage growth rate of approximately 8% and with our strong balance sheet, we are investing in strategic capital initiatives that will ensure our growth for longer term.", "In closing, I would like to thank every Tractor Supply team member for their ongoing hard work and commitment to our company.  I want to thank Jim Wright, our Executive Chairman, and our Board of Directors for their support and our shareholders for your ongoing investment and confidence in Tractor Supply as a growth company.", "I\u2019m delighted to be working with such a seasoned and talented executive team and acknowledge the opportunity to serve you, our shareholders, in my new role as Chief Executive Officer.", "Operator, I would now like to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "Given the strong outlook for 2013, could you provide updated perspective on where you see the margin potential of the business?  I think your prior objective around 9.5% looks, if our math is correct, as if you can be there in \u201913.  So what is the upside potential and should we think about that more along the lines of gross margin?", "Tony Crudele", "I\u2019d like to remind you that the 9.5% EBIT target is really set as an interim goal and we have not yet hit the 9.5%.  We will continue to evaluate that position.  It\u2019s much easier for us to stay in that long-term perspective of growing the business at the 10 to 20 basis points of EBIT margin improvement each year.", "We\u2019ll continue to reassess and we\u2019ll definitely get back to the marketplace as we approach and exceed the 9.5%.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "Let me maybe ask a follow-up.  If there were to be areas that you would look to invest at a more aggressive rate, what would those areas that you would consider as tradeoffs?", "Greg Sandfort", "Mark, if you\u2019re asking what parts of the business potentially could drive sales but could be a bit of a drag on margin \u2013 is that what you\u2019re asking?", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "Exactly and to what degree might that play out as we go through the year into next  year.", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, one of the things that we talked about earlier in our comments was the driving force of Q.  And we\u2019ve stated many times that it works at a less than company average margin rate but the dollars it throws off are considerable.", "It helps us leverage on the SG&A side and also we\u2019re looking right now at our business a little differently from a mix standpoint because Q is growing but we\u2019re also finding that in the box other components of that box are starting to grow.", "We\u2019ve got a business on the outside of the store with a lot of product that Steve and the team has been working on.  The left hand side, being more the hard lines business with a mix of the products are higher margin, so I guess the blend is what I\u2019m saying to you we think we can control and we do believe as we move forward we\u2019ll still see some growth in our EBIT margins but it\u2019s hard to say when we\u2019ll hit the 9.5% and when we\u2019ll go beyond but we still believe that there is tremendous momentum behind Q and that is going to be one of the things we have to just monitor and watch from a mix standpoint.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens", "Greg, would you mention a little bit \u2013 you talked about the newness in the spring season a little bit, what we expect there and if you split that out and take it another step with the regional product and just how far do we have to go there and maybe some examples of success there on that regional brand?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, on newness factor, John, you know that we talk about changes in the store every year and in the first part of the year we make most of our plannogram, hard plannogram changes.", "And we\u2019ll touch between 30% and 40% of the store updating plannograms and bringing in newness there.  The second piece is about what we do in the center cord and on the outside of the store.", "And Steve and the team have done a wonderful job of bringing literally probably 50% to 60% of new product into those spaces year after year.  You\u2019ll see that again this year as you walk into our stores.  You\u2019ll notice new things that are either brand extensions or maybe we\u2019ll be testing and trying some new products.", "And we have a lot of confidence that through the testing of the last two years and our live product categories and this whole garden concept of our consumer being sustainable and growing their own vegetables and so on and so forth and foods that this is going to be a business that is going to serve us well for some time.", "So there\u2019s movement inside; there\u2019s movement outside.  You\u2019ll see more of this as we use our advertising to talk to it.  But quite a bit of newness, quite a bit of newness.", "John Lawrence - Stephens", "Do we have to wait a few weeks to hear more about the crawl stop?", "Greg Sandfort", "Yes.  We\u2019re analyzing that right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America", "Wanted to ask first about your gross margin initiative.  Obviously you had some nice continued progress this quarter.  But can you guys just give us an update in terms of where you are and specifically maybe where we are from the price optimization standpoint?", "I know now it\u2019s been quite a while since all the items have been loaded into the software.  Can you just give us an update in terms of where you are today with that?", "Greg Sandfort", "Yes, Vince, I\u2019ll talk a little bit about some of the initiatives and we\u2019re start with price op.  As we now are into year two of price optimization.  What we\u2019re finding is that it\u2019s a very iterative process and that changes we\u2019ll make within the testing module that we have and I\u2019ll remind you that we don\u2019t just turn this system on and let it run.  We do test and then we have against control stores to make sure that we\u2019re getting the right results, our anticipated result that we thought.", "But once we do that, we put that into play and we look at sets of SKUs, it changes the dynamics of the sales.  We see it sometimes, some sales moving to other SKUs and vice versa.", "So what this helped us do longer term is look at our overall assortments and say do we need to change the depth within X, Y, Z SKUs and maybe we don\u2019t need to carry these other SKUs in the assortment any longer because there\u2019s been a transferrable demand.", "And that\u2019s the learnings that we\u2019re now starting to see along with the fact that making sure that we\u2019ve got our prices right by district, by store and sometimes across region on a lot of our Q products and the high velocity products.", "So we\u2019re still, in my opinion, as I see how this is developing and I see the kind of results that we\u2019re starting to measure against, it\u2019s a much longer-term journey than I think I initially anticipated.", "We mentioned a little earlier about the other things in gross margin, the direct sourcing of product and our exclusive brand.  I mentioned one earlier about EquiStages.  The team continues to find opportunities within our assortments where we can build and place into the assortment a very competitive product under our own brand that our customers will accept and embrace and they\u2019ll purchase.", "And in many cases, it\u2019s not cannibalizing.  It\u2019s actually additive to what we have in our assortment because we recognize the gap that either the national brands can\u2019t serve or the generic (inaudible) can\u2019t.", "So those businesses continue to grow and we are developing some sophistication now that in this now almost two years, almost going into three, with our product development side and with our direct sourcing side.", "And I\u2019m very pleased with those teams and what products they\u2019re developing and we\u2019re bringing to market.  And the advantage there is, of course, that it\u2019s exclusive to Tractor.  You can only buy it here, so it gives us that exclusivity and that uniqueness and that also is going to feed the margin rate over the longer term.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Bank of America", "Just one follow-up question, if I may, for your CapEx outlook for \u201913, I know you mentioned that largely the increase is due to just the several timing shifts from this year into next.  Any other color or discussion that you guys can provide specifically around your store locations, further western states that you may be entering?", "I know you mentioned Colorado from last year, of course, was a new state and then any other color around those four potential self-develop projects you mentioned.", "Tony Crudele", "When it comes to our expansions, Colorado was as key state in 2012 and will continue to expand there as we move into 2013.  And then our next state that\u2019s targeted is Arizona and we\u2019ve been looking at some sites there and some sites in our real estate committees already.", "So we\u2019ll be looking at Arizona in 2013.  So those will be the two key states as we move west.", "When it comes to CapEx and the drivers really the only point of note would be that the southeast distribution center will come online in most likely mid to late third quarter and that\u2019s when you would recognize some depreciation around that facility, which is in the $40 million range.", "And then the capital that\u2019s allocated towards the store support center, our corporate headquarter, since that does not come on until 2014, you should see very limited depreciation around approximately $40 million there that we\u2019ve targeted to spend in 2013, so we would not expect to have any depreciation as that stays in construction in progress.", "When it comes to self development, we have a small team on staff where when we identify sites that might not be cost effective to go in with a developer, we have obviously the financing capabilities and now the in house capabilities to be able to develop that site and either land bank that site and/or just develop that site for store locations.", "So it\u2019s a small team.  We\u2019ve been developing the expertise over the last couple years and so we expect to continue to accelerate that so that at some point in time we\u2019ll be in the four to maybe 15 new stores would be developed by our own team in house.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W Baird.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W Baird", "First, Tony, just to follow up on the last question there, can you give us anything just where you think the DEI is going to come in in aggregate in 2013?  I know there\u2019s a lot of moving parts there but is there a range that you can help us with in terms of what the DEI will be next year?", "Tony Crudele", "", "DEI, we haven\u2019t specifically given that but I would say it\u2019s consistent with the growth that we\u2019ve had and very similar to the prior years.  So you\u2019re looking at I want to see we\u2019re close to $88 million $90 million range for 2012 and I would expect that to increase by about 10%.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W Baird", "And then just the small stores or the smaller market store format, how many did you guys get opened in \u201912 and then what\u2019s the plan as you look out to \u201913?  Of those 105 stores, how many do you think will be in that smaller market footprint?", "Greg Sandfort", "We don\u2019t \u2013 probably won\u2019t comment (to that money).  We (open end specific).  It\u2019s part of the overall mix of stores.  But we\u2019re really pleased with our performance and the thing about these small stores, it\u2019s really not a different concept.", "All it is is a store that\u2019s right size for the size of the market and what we\u2019ve done in these stores is modified some depth and breadth of assortment to match the market.  In fact, I think you\u2019ve probably been in a couple of these where you can\u2019t tell the difference when you go in.  The typical customer thinks this is the same Tractor Supply.  It just is a smaller box.", "So what I would tell you is plans are to continue with those backfill or those small market stores.  We still believe that it\u2019s in the run rate of the 2100 and so far so good.", "Peter Benedict \u2013 Robert W Baird", "Then just lastly, any sense of how many stores you think you could get forage into by the end of this year?  I think you said you were at 750 at the end of \u201912.", "Greg Sandfort", "That won\u2019t be a specific number either and here is why.  You have some restrictions with forage.  There are some landlords that we have stores leased with that will not let us place trailers on the lots and many of those we\u2019re in negotiation with trying to figure out is there another way of doing this.  Can we put it maybe in our side lot or the back lot?", "So 750 is not the end number.  There will be more but I really can\u2019t give you a target yet because we were surprised we could get it as far as we did this year.  The team\u2019s still working on it.  But it won\u2019t be all stores.  I can tell you that because there will be some restrictions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", "Scott Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "When you\u2019re looking at SG&A per store, it was down in almost every quarter of the year and obviously it was \u2013 there was an outside impact in the fourth quarter due to incentive comp.  But was there any other call outs during the course of the year that helped that metric?  And then when we think about 2013, any other factors we should be considering?", "Tony Crudele", "Well, when we look at the quarters, the only thing that jumped out last year really was the warm Q1 that we had, so we didn\u2019t have the standard expenses that we normally would have in Q1.", "Then obviously in Q4, we were up against a period that had additional sales in 2011 so we had additional week of sales in 2011, so that made it a little bit more difficult to leverage against the SG&A.  So those would be the two things that jump out relative to 2012.", "Scott Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "So when you think about 2013, whether it\u2019s healthcare costs or anything else that you have top of mind as tougher cost save control?", "Tony Crudele", "We do.  Where we\u2019ve been getting the leverage is really in \u2013 the demand has been in the store payroll.  We had really a terrific year this past year.  And as we grow the comp sales, we have seen leverage on the occupancy and so that\u2019s given us the ability to absorb some of the additional expense that we would have in medical, although medical in 2012 did not exceed what we had originally forecasted.", "So our in house program has done very well.  We\u2019re self-insured and so we\u2019ve been \u2013 had some fairly good results when it comes to medical.  But we have planned as we move into 2013 that we will have an increase in that area and anticipate that to be offset by a normalized incentive compensation for 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "You quantified the anticipated impact of the mix shift to Q on your gross margin guidance for next year.  I think you said 10 to 15 basis points of mix headwind.  Is that similar to where it\u2019s been in each of the past couple years?", "Tony Crudele", "Relatively consistent; it has run in that range and it will vary quarter to quarter but overall for the full year we\u2019ll look at it somewhere between 8% to 12% or, in this case, 10% to 15%.  So it\u2019s about consistent with prior year.", "Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And then second question, is it possible to quantify the impact of the incentive comp swing in the fourth quarter?  And obviously you had a very good fourth quarter a year ago, so maybe on a two-year basis, does that come out in the wash or is this a below average quarter from the incentive comp perspective?", "Tony Crudele", "Yes, usually we will identify \u2013 if it\u2019s a significant amount, we\u2019ll highlight it as one of the main drivers.  This quarter was a very strong quarter, as was last year.  The way it was \u2013 the incentive comp was accrued throughout the year, it did have less in this Q4 than in the prior year but I do not have exactly what the biggest point impact was.  But it definitely was favorable.", "Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And third and finally, just you essentially spoke about very little change in consumer behavior and presumably that pertains to big ticket as well.  Any color you could offer on the signs of life perhaps or new signs of life in the big ticket arena.  The ticket (x) inflation was a bit better than it was the prior couple quarters.  I know that the hurricane might have had something to do with that but any sign of inflection there would be helpful to hear about.", "Tony Crudele", "Yes, right now we\u2019re not anticipating a significant change.  We\u2019ve yet to declare victory when it comes to big ticket.  When we do see an increase it tends to be spotty and unsustained but at times we do see a pickup relatively well, especially obviously when we run into the emergency response categories in the fourth quarter.", "Hard to assess the fourth quarter because the warm winter impacted a lot of the sales of our larger ticket items but there does not seem to be a resistance when there is a need by the retail community.  They will make that purchase, so we believe it will be consistent throughout 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Magee \u2013 SunTrust.", "David Magee \u2013 SunTrust", "On the forage business, is that expected to comp well?  Was the startup such that you could still see growth from those 750 stores this year?  And I\u2019m just also curious about the margins of that category right now.", "Greg Sandfort", "Yes, we do still see a ramp in forage and the reason being is that we had a number of customers that once they start to see that we carry the full assortment now maybe there were some customers \u2013 at least what we see in our numbers that were shopping in other places.  We\u2019re in the early stages of ramping that business.", "Secondly, on the margin side, it\u2019s very similar to what we do in our sales and margin dollars and feed.  It\u2019s not robust but at the same time it\u2019s a completer and it\u2019s a footstep driver, so it runs around the feed margins.", "David Magee - SunTrust", "How does the live plant category compare to that in terms of potential and is that now in all the stores?", "Greg Sandfort", "The live plant and what we consider will be \u2013 we\u2019ll just call it live goods \u2013 will not be in all stores but is from a margin standpoint can be a bit more robust than forage and it really is how we manage our business.", "We\u2019re not going to run it like the big boxes.  We\u2019re going to run it basically into the season early and then probably exit the season a bit early so that we can transition.", "Our need for these types of products are plant, harvest and can and so on and so forth.  There\u2019s a stage to ours.  So as we get through that, there\u2019s no need for us to continue to try to extend that season.  So we\u2019re going to get in, set it, take our sales and make sure that we stay profitable and move on and we\u2019ve got some tremendous partners who have chosen to work with us.  It will be in a substantial number of stores but not all stores for spring.", "David Magee - SunTrust", "That\u2019s versus a limited number of stores last year.", "Greg Sandfort", "", "Yes, very limited numbers last year.", "David Magee - SunTrust", "And then lastly \u2013 and I apologize if I missed this \u2013 but Tony, I think you had said that the gross margins would be weighted to the second half and I\u2019m just curious as to what\u2019s causing maybe the first half to be a little bit weaker on a year-to-year basis.", "Tony Crudele", "Some of it is the way in which we cycle through some of the seasonal goods from the winter and also some of \u2013 the back half of the year generally will have less of the lower margin type products and some of the big ticket.", "And the way we\u2019re looking at the mix and the impact of say the (rider) season on spring can have an impact as well.", "So a lot of it is really mix oriented and, again, it\u2019s very difficult when you have 77 different departments and 340 different categories to develop that merchandising plan.  And the mix can obviously impact margin significantly.", "So and as we look at the second half of the year we think we have a little bit easier compare in Q3 where we obviously had a lot conversations on that call about margins as well, so we think we had a little bit easier compare when we look at Q3 as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray.", "Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "I wanted to ask a question about the gross margin.  The performance in Q4 was pretty impressive and I just wanted to compare it against what you saw in Q3.  Now, certainly we know there was the easier mark down compare you (inaudible) but it still looked like you saw some sequential acceleration in the drivers.", "I\u2019m wondering if you have any color on what some of your key drivers that may have picked up in Q4 relative to Q3.", "Greg Sandfort", "As we looked at the business as it was developing, we had to stay patient and I guess that\u2019s the word I\u2019ll use.  Merchant team tried to understand what was happening and we saw a lot of our products out of need.", "So when you look at need-based products, if you don\u2019t have the need, you don\u2019t have the demand like weather and such, that can cause you to do some things sometimes, if your inventories are too heavy, to start overreacting.", "There\u2019s a couple things here.  Inventory management did a great job of keeping our inventories tight and then as we said earlier the business really opened up toward the end of the quarter and we were in position and we were still at what I would call robust retails.", "The other thing is our management of clearance.  We are a different company today than we were five years ago.  We take that \u2013 when we move the clearance and we start to see products not selling to the degree that we\u2019d like, we\u2019ll take those first initial markdowns understanding that that 20% markdown gets me $0.80 on the dollar today versus if I wait until January or February when I get $0.20 on the dollar, I\u2019m at 80% off.", "So we\u2019re fairly aggressive on moving through inventory when we see issues and I would tell you that\u2019s the other component, really tight management of any clearance as we\u2019re moving through the season and then the overall management of our inventory and being patient, not pulling the trigger and overreacting.", "Tony Crudele", "And then a couple other real quick points, when we look at the impact of big ticket in Q4, we had less of a drag than we would have anticipated because of the softness of some of the larger big tickets, as I mentioned earlier, on the log splitters and snow blowers.", "As well as, as in the past, the import and strategic sourcing products that we have had a big impact in Q4 as well and they\u2019re a little bit obviously stronger margin items and that tends to benefit Q4 as well.", "Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Just to follow up, as we think about all of your key drivers \u2013 I guess there\u2019s four of them \u2013 looking out to 2013, are there any that you think actually have the potential to accelerate as a benefit and then conversely anything that you think may have already played itself out that probably diminishes as a benefit?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, I would comment to this.  I said earlier that price optimization has got a much longer horizon.  It\u2019s teaching us a lot more about how to price our products and it\u2019s also teaching us, in some cases, how to sort our products.  So that\u2019s got a much longer horizon.", "I think I know that we\u2019ve got more opportunity to take the (cusa) brand mix of our products and accelerate that in the areas where it makes sense.  And we\u2019re starting to find those gaps.", "The other thing I will tell you is when we look at management of clearance and the seasonal conversions, I mentioned earlier that we did a wonderful job of that.  But I think it\u2019s all about \u2013 truthfully, it\u2019s a balanced equation between all of these and some things drive sales, some things drive margin, some things as they blend together can be an offset to SG&A.", "So from the standpoint of how the margins in those four buckets are working, they\u2019re all still working hard.  I would say the one that we are probably most developed on is the seasonal conversion piece.  We\u2019ve been working on that the longest.  Quite a bit of room ahead of us for price op and as well as deeper exclusive brand development and then more opportunity yet to bring product from overseas in a direct sourcing capacity.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "One, could you talk about how you\u2019re planning for the timing of receipts this spring and just category change overs given the unique weather we had last year?  Are you going to try to go back to normal or do you maybe (set) a little bit earlier?", "Greg Sandfort", "Actually, Matt, it\u2019s about the same time.  Last year we somewhat went south to north in three ways and then that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be doing again this year.  So if you\u2019re in our southern stores right now, you\u2019ll see that.  You\u2019ll see we\u2019re relatively set for spring.  And Midwest is beginning and north will be quite a bit later yet.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Then secondly, earlier in the year you talked about spending more on marketing to convert aware non-shoppers.  Do you think that you\u2019ve made progress on this goal this year and is there any way that you could quantify the increase in new customers?", "Tony Crudele", "What I would tell you is that we\u2019re still trying to find the right mix of marketing vehicles to reach this consumer base.  We had some success in the second test.  We will be doing some more testing this year but we\u2019re not convinced yet that we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re hitting all eight cylinders as far as understanding how to get to these people.", "They\u2019re still coming into our stores but they\u2019re coming in sporadically on a test basis.  We want to be able to talk to them directly, so more work to be done.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "And marketing expense as a percent of sales for 2013?", "Tony Crudele", "Slightly up and the majority of that really is how we\u2019re now using our marketing dollars across the company.  We\u2019re now looking at more of what I\u2019ll call a cross channel marketing effort.", "You will see us do more things and things that tie back throughout the web and print and in store and all that as really one voice to the consumer.  So that\u2019s \u2013 the spend will be raised a bit in the \u2013 I\u2019ll call it the multi channel or the web side of our marketing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer.", "Brian Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer", "The question I had \u2013 there is a lot of chatter lately, over the last few months within the investment community regarding inflation or maybe deflation in some of your input costs and that any impact you may see on margin sales.  From \u2013 maybe an update there.  Where are we right now with respect to the inflation, deflation as you\u2019re making your way through cost of sales?  How should we think about it as we\u2019re modeling out 2013?", "Tony Crudele", "Brian, we\u2019re at the point where the majority of the inflation has moderated and so as we look at the upcoming year and compare it to the pricing of last year, that\u2019s how we come up with our inflation expectations of 1% to 2%.  So it\u2019s clearly moderated.  The majority of the inflation we saw last year has worked its way through our costs and it\u2019s really going to come down to how does 2013 play out?", "Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer", "So is it fair to say then that going \u2013 as we sit right now it\u2019s much less of a factor going forward?", "Tony Crudele", "It should be.  As we see the numbers on a year-over-year basis \u2013 now, again, as we work through the year that can change.  But it should be less of a factor.  As we noted in Q4 last year, it was almost 500 basis points.  So it really has moderated.", "We currently don\u2019t anticipate seeing a downturn towards deflation and it will just continue at a very low or moderate pace.", "Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer", "The second question \u2013 it\u2019ll be a quick one \u2013 you called out in your prepared comments I think the benefit of Sandy on your comps in Q4.  How should we think about the ongoing, maybe an ongoing benefit to Tractor Supply as people prepare their land and such from the hurricane?", "Tony Crudele", "We\u2019ve commented before that a lot of times there is a much longer tail for some of the home centers because it relates to home building and repair.  But it really is much less of an impact for us and so we don\u2019t look at it as a tail.  We look at it more as hurricane preparedness and then the short response following and the recovery area efforts.", "The one category that does benefit is more the fencing category.  (There\u2019s usually) some damaged fencing and we\u2019ll be able to repair that and that might be extended.  But we generally have confined the impacts of Sandy just to the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan.", "Chris Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan", "I was just curious if you could talk about incremental margins in the business.  As we model out the first quarter, $38 million of pull forward and the $1.5 million in savings last year, if you use, let\u2019s say, a 20% incremental margin on sales, do we start in the high 40s as an EPS base versus the 55 that you did last year?", "Tony Crudele", "Well, hopefully the information that we provided gives you enough to populate your models.  I will give you a little bit of guidance saying that our goal \u2013 and we believe that we have the plans in place to drive an EPS increase and we expect to drive a comp increase as well.", "And so I think if you put that together with the $38 million, adjust for the $38 million sales impact I think you can come to those same outcomes when it comes to the first quarter as well as the first half.", "Chris Horvers - JPMorgan", "And a couple random follow ups, can you talk about what Q did in terms of comp in the quarter?  It had been running in I guess the high-single digits recently.  And then also on the live product side, is that going to be a consignment basis or do you take ownership of the inventory?", "Greg Sandfort", "On the Q side, we typically don\u2019t talk to what kind of sales increases.  But I can tell you that there was an increase in our overall mix because of Qs impact on sales.  So Q did actually help us drive some additional sales.  It was a larger percentage, not a great number, not a very large number but some tailwind.", "On the live goods side of the business, you\u2019re right.  (You\u2019ll probably) value a lot of this is on consignment or scan based, which helps us on the downside risk.  We have a number of stores we\u2019ll be having true service of a product by the manufacturers and then some stores we\u2019ll be managing ourselves.  So we\u2019re testing it both ways to see what seems to work best.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Just wanted to ask a couple questions about some of the merchandising programs in the quarter, there are two questions.  First about the heating program, just given the impact of the warm weather, I know you guys rolled out a couple of new stoves and things like that.  And I just wanted to see how the (gift) program went as well.", "And then the follow-up question would be when generators, we did check a significant number of stores.  Was there any negative impact from a lack of supply of generators?  We heard that even people like Briggs had actually run out at the supplier end.  Was that \u2013 did that impact you guys in the quarter?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, let\u2019s just talk about heating first.  Heating was, as I said earlier, some of the seasonal businesses weren\u2019t as robust but it did come late and it came as the weather changed.  This is one of those demand businesses again that unless you have the demand, you can overreact and really burn margin with no result of sales.", "So we sat tight, kept our inventories tight and we did see our last minute push on the heating side of the business particularly in the fuel side.", "On the generator question, there weren\u2019t enough generators in the country when this storm hit to be able to service the need.  And that would be my overall statement.  From what we knew, we were continuing to pull generators from all four corners of the US with our suppliers and there was probably some missed business.", "I think what we\u2019re going to see from the northeastern quadrant is individuals wanting to put what I\u2019ll call standby generators, not the portables but standbys, in their homes because this is the second year now that they\u2019ve been without power.", "So we\u2019re \u2013 I can\u2019t tell you that we\u2019ve seen a real major uptick there yet but I think as the rebuilding occurs I think (Generac) and companies like that might see a nice push in their business.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Will you talk about gross margin maybe in a little different perspective?  I guess if we\u2019re sitting a year from now and gross margin ends up being better than the 15 basis points, 20, 30 basis points, do you think that will be more a result of mix issue meaning Q growing slower than the rest of the house or is it maybe due to some of the initiatives being bigger contributors than you expected?", "Greg Sandfort", "I would tell you that we like what we\u2019re seeing in the growth of Q.  There will be no plans to slow Q.  What we\u2019re working diligently on is how we can grow at a faster pace, the mixes of our business.", "And some of that is going to be with some high velocity products but the other side of that coin is going to be what we\u2019re doing with an exclusive brand, what we \u2013 we should be able to gain some additional margin and then our ability to source product internationally or really just strategically source product and gain better cost.", "And all those mixes combined \u2013 we track, we monitor and I think that\u2019s going to help us continue to better predict as well as keep our hands around the gross margin equation.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And with regard to the product acquisition cost in Q, given that you\u2019re taking more market share and you\u2019re becoming a bigger customer probably for some of these vendors, are you seeing an improvement in margin in that category?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, here\u2019s how we do that.  To be honest with you, yes, size and scale does matter.  It does help.  But oen of the things that we\u2019ve done over the last few years is we\u2019ve multisourced products, particular categories that are high velocity and low value, so we are able to use multiple vendors and through that prospect in between we\u2019re able to find advantages to bringing our supply chain cost down because we\u2019re getting closer to where the manufacturing is and that\u2019s the biggest cost in most of that product is the transportation side.  So that\u2019s how we\u2019re doing it.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And then my follow-up is can you talk about new space productivity?  It looks like it\u2019s still very strong, maybe our math just took a step back.  The way we look at it could be very skewed.  So curious what your thoughts on new stores are.", "Tony Crudele", "Yes, the new stores have been extremely productive in 2013.  And some of that has to do with as we move into new territories where there might be a little bit less cannibalization, maybe some areas where it\u2019s a little bit less competitive.", "But as we look at the stores, we believe that there\u2019s not a significant variation in how we\u2019ve approved the store or looked at the stores.  And we just believe that as the Tractor Supply name becomes much better known throughout, it\u2019s easier to open those stores and be able to penetrate the marketplace a little bit more rapidly than in the past.", "So again, we\u2019re very pleased with the new stores and the program and the  marketing around it and that\u2019s helped to drive the business as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "One question, in terms of 2013, the competitive pricing environment and what you\u2019re thinking about in terms of promotions, I\u2019m interested in how you\u2019re thinking about that form a competitive standpoint and how you\u2019re thinking about that balancing that relative to the pursuit of gaining market share and driving sales.", "Greg Sandfort", "We look at this constantly.  Again, in our gross margin equation, there\u2019s really three things we look at: are we trying to grow this business from a market share standpoint; if we do, we understand there will be some compression on margin.", "When we look at it from a mix business and saying, listen, if this is a project complete tour, probably don\u2019t need to be as competitive because they\u2019ve got to have it to make the project work and then there\u2019s that blend of a little bit of both.", "So we\u2019re going to stay very aggressive on growing market share.  What we find is that with the price optimization tool that we are now using, it\u2019s giving us some insights to where we need to be priced and it\u2019s not always about being the lowest priced.  It\u2019s about being the right price by market and that\u2019s why \u2013 another reason why we had to have this system.", "We\u2019ve got in the range of 1200 stores in many, many \u2013 46 states and you\u2019ve got to have some type of tool to help you work through that.  And we\u2019re very confident that we run our advertising based upon regional need and regional price, sometimes even down to the district level.  So it\u2019s not about just driving it by price.  There\u2019s a mixture of things that we do and we\u2019re learning as we go. I\u2019ll be honest.", "We\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019ve still got things that we can do to improve our performance.", "Tony Crudele", "Philosophically, though, we will not come into a marketplace and drive price down.  But we will be extremely competitive in some situations and what we\u2019ve learned is \u2013 and what the tool has given us is the ability to be able to better manage the price so in the event that we focus on market share and drive increased sales, then we will get the leverage that we would expect from leveraging SG&A versus improved gross margin rate.", "So that\u2019s where we see the tradeoff and it gives us great flexibility in determining whether we increase EBIT margin through gross margin or leverage SG&A.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "And then as a follow up, as you think about \u201913 in this realm, does the behavior to your actions, you do anything materially different in \u201913 than \u201912 with the learnings you experienced and the environment?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, I would tell you from what we see now, the customer is still responding very similarly to what they did back in 12 with the exception of the weather patterns.  Again, our business is a need-based business and if you have animals, you have property and you have equipment, you\u2019re going to shop Tractor Supply.", "There are other things we carry in our assortments that are more seasonally sensitive and if we see movement in seasonal, we seem to see more of an uptick but we\u2019re less sensitive today than we\u2019ve been.", "We\u2019ve somewhat been able to moderate that by really bringing the business across all four walls of the store.  So I think right now we feel very comfortable from a mix standpoint and there\u2019s some upside, of course, if the weather plays in our favor.  And moisture in the spring is a good thing and cold in the fall is a good thing.", "Operator", "There are no further questions.  Please continue with any closing remarks.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you, operator.  Well, thank you all for joining us on today\u2019s call.  While we are very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in the past few years, we are more committed today than ever to continue growing Tractor Supply to be a more profitable retailer and returning greater value to our shareholders.", "Our teams are planning, preparing and executing and reacting better than ever before.  We\u2019re committed to provide the right merchandise in the right regions at the right time to our customers while bringing quality products and great values.", "Our business model is solid and we continue to build momentum in our business.  Thank you for your continued support of Tractor Supply Company and we look forward to speaking with all of you again in about 90 days.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that reproduction of this call, in whole or in part, is not permitted without prior written authorization of Tractor Supply Company.

Greg, please go ahead.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you, Jen, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you, all, for joining us on today's call. With me today is our CFO, Tony Crudele.", "We are delighted with our results and our level of execution in the second quarter. Despite a late start to spring with cooler weather early in the quarter, our team made the necessary adjustments to address those shifts, while delivering improvement in sales and operating profitability.", "Our performance in the first half of 2013 demonstrates the continued strength and stability of our core business model.", "At Tractor Supply, we continue to focus on our sales driving and margin-enhancing strategic initiatives and through our expansion of our exclusive brand offerings, better localization of our assortments and the improvements in our supply chain capabilities, we are increasing our market share and improving our profitability as a company.", "Our previous call in late April, we discussed that the second quarter had started with much cooler weather and as we had anticipated. We experienced a slower sales ramp in the spring. We adjusted our plans accordingly for this shift, and although we felt we did not recapture as much as the postponed spring seasonal sales from the first quarter as we would have liked, we are pleased with our team's ability to deliver strong comparable store sales increases over a year ago.", "While certain big-ticket seasonal products such as riding lawnmowers did not rebound as we had hoped, we experienced very strong sales trends in our C.U.E. categories, our new live goods and garden products, poultry as a category and apparel and footwear. More importantly, our teams managed our seasonal products effectively, and we finished the quarter well-positioned with current high-quality inventory as we enter the back half of the year.", "Now let me discuss our second quarter results in a bit more detail. Regarding sales drivers. Our C.U.E. categories, the consumable, usable and edible part of our business, remain very strong. These are need-based items that are driving repeat footsteps into our stores.", "The repair and maintenance parts business for outdoor power equipment, a C.U.E. category, has trended above last year's sales levels, reinforcing the behavior that our customers are repairing their products to extend their life versus replacing them.", "C.U.E. remains a foundational piece of our sales driving strategies, and we work diligently every day to enhance and expand these products to meet the changing needs of our customers.", "Another strategic area of focus for us is driving sales in our drive aisle and center court areas, where we strive to maximize sales per square foot. We utilize this space to host special events and to introduce new and seasonally appropriate products.", "This is not only -- this not only enhances our customer shopping experience and expands the overall size of the customers market basket, but it also signals to our merchant teams what products our customers have the most interest in purchasing as we build forward assortments.", "One such event was our Garden event, which provided our customers with a selection of new products and great everyday values on seasonal commodities such as seed, soil and fertilizers.", "Additionally, we hosted a poultry event during the same period labeled Chick days. During this event, we provided our customers with a wide array of items related to raising poultry. Both of these planned events performed well, delivering results above the prior year.", "Our introduction of newness into our stores utilizing our test and learn approach continues to gain momentum.", "One great example is our Live Goods Program, which we began testing about 3 years ago. In this category, we expanded our assortments of bedding plants, vegetables, seedlings, herbs and fruit-bearing trees. Our customers have responded well to our offerings and we are very optimistic about the potential for further expansion of this business over time.", "Our exclusive brands continued to exhibit growth during the second quarter and accounted for roughly 29% of our sales mix. Exclusive brands are an important differentiator for Tractor Supply and a key initiative in driving increased footsteps, customer loyalty and improved profitability.", "During the second quarter, we continued the expansion of our 4health exclusive brand dog food through the introduction of grain-free products. Customer response has been very positive. This is an expansion of our Super Premium assortments, which continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments in our pet food category.", "We also added several other new products to our pet health department with similar positive responses from our customers.", "So to summarize, I am delighted with the team's ability to manage through the numerous variables and seasonal shifts we faced during the quarter. The diligent work of our teams both at store level and at the Store Support Center was exceptional, resulting in solid comparable store sales, transaction count improvement and another quarter of double-digit growth and profitability.", "I will now turn the call over to Tony to review our financial results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2013.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Great. Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended June 29, 2013, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 12.7% to $1.46 billion, and net income grew by approximately 15.9% to $123.6 million or $1.75 per diluted share.", "Comp store sales increased 7.2% for the second quarter compared to last year's increase of 3.2%.", "As Greg discussed, although there was much later start to the spring this year, spring did finally come and, correspondingly, drove solid sales performance.", "Although we believe we did not recapture all the postponed seasonal sales from the first quarter as a result of the delayed spring, we did plan for the seasonal shift between quarters and managed accordingly to deliver strong performance for the second quarter and the first half, overall.", "The animal and pet categories continue to be the main drivers of our business with strong comps that were above the chain average, seasonal category such as live goods, certain gardening categories, outdoor recreation and rubber footwear all performed well above company average for the quarter and the season.", "Comp transaction count increased for the 21st consecutive quarter, gaining 4.8% on top of a 2.9% increase last year.", "With the delayed spring and the continued strength of feed and pet products, C.U.E. products, which serve our customers basic and functional needs, continue to be the key driver of the transaction count increase.", "Average comp ticket increased by 2.3% versus last year's 11-basis point increase. The increase was driven by inflation and mix, and to a lesser extent, big-ticket sales.", "A few key points about the quarter. Despite the slow start to the quarter, sales were consistent with our expectations. Adjusting for the $38 million pull forward of sales into the first quarter from the second quarter last year, comparable sales to this year would be very consistent for each quarter in the first half with a year-to-date comp of 4.2%.", "On a regional basis, our warmer regions performed the best as they were the least impacted by the delayed spring weather and all regions generated positive comp sales.", "As we had anticipated, April was the softness month of the quarter, with May delivering the strongest comp store sales gain. All 3 months achieved solid positive comp sales.", "Big-ticket delivered a solid comp sales increase, but was below the chain average.", "For the quarter, we did have a comp sales increase in the riding lawnmower category, which resulted principally from the weather-related sales shift between quarters compared to last year.", "For the overall season, the riding lawnmower industry continues to be sluggish, which was reflective of our first half performance in that category.", "We estimate that inflation was approximately 140 basis points and was within our projected range of 1% to 2% for the full year.", "Import sales increased 25% and represented 10.8% of the sales mix. Exclusive brand sales also increased by almost 25% and represented 29% of total sales.", "Turning to gross margin, which as a percent of sales, decreased by 18 basis points to 34.8%. This was consistent with our outlook as we anticipated the gross margin will be flat to slightly down in the first half of the year.", "Our initial direct margin continues to improve significantly as a result of our initiatives around price optimization, markdown management and strategic sourcing.", "The largest factor offsetting the benefits from our margin-enhancing initiatives was merchandise mix, which we estimate had a negative impact of approximately 40 basis points. This was primarily related to C.U.E. products, which continue to make up a larger percentage of our sales compared to prior year.", "We continue to manage gross margin dollars per unit, which again increased in our C.U.E. categories this quarter.", "Freight increased approximately 16 basis points principally as a result of the continued mix shift to freight-intensive C.U.E. products, as well as costs related to increased import activity.", "We also opened a smaller percentage of new stores relative to the total store base in the first half of this year compared to the last year. We estimate that this had a negative impact on gross margin in the quarter of approximately 10 basis points, as new stores generally run a stronger margin.", "For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, was 21.2% of sales, reflecting 63 basis points of improvement from the prior year's quarter.", "As we have discussed in the past, although our increasing mix of C.U.E. sales impacts gross margin rate, it also provides us with an increasing sales base that allows greater leverage of SG&A expenses.", "We continue to effectively manage and leverage store level operating expenses. Even in light of a very strong sales quarter, our incentive compensation program provided 13 basis points of leverage.", "We are particularly pleased with our ability to leverage SG&A despite the additional costs related to our DC and data center relocations, which we estimate negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.02 for the second quarter.", "Our effective income tax rate increased to 37.4% in Q2 compared to 37.2% last year. The increase was due principally to higher effective state tax rates and reduced federal tax credits, as well as a smaller percentage of incentive stock option disqualifications relative to a higher taxable income base.", "Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q2, we had a cash balance of $56 million compared to $179.1 million last year.", "During the second quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired approximately 177,000 shares for $19.4 million. Our stock performed very well during the quarter, which limited the purchases under our matrixed 10b-5 plan. We estimate that the share repurchase program did not have a material impact on EPS for the quarter.", "Average inventory levels per store at quarter end were 4.7% higher than last year, while annualized inventory turns increased by 10 basis points and 3 basis points for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively.", "We are pleased with the productivity of inventory during the quarter despite later inventory carry in a number of spring categories related to the later extended spring season this year.", "Additionally, we shifted some Q3 receipts to the end of the second quarter this year and also carried additional inventory to support the transition to our new Southeast distribution center, both of which contributed to our higher inventory levels at quarter end.", "Overall, we do not anticipate any markdown exposure in Q3 outside of our normal clearance activity. In fact, we believe we are in better position than last year to clear our spring inventories productively given our improved inventory turns, as well as improved moisture levels and fewer drought-affected regions relative to last year.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $49.3 million compared to $33.8 million last year. We opened 26 stores this quarter compared to 18 stores in the second quarter of 2012. The increase in capital spend relates to the construction of our relocated Southeast distribution center and the construction of our new Store Support Center.", "Turning our attention to the full year outlook. As a result of our stronger-than-expected operating performance in the first half, we are increasing our net income expectation for the full year 2013.", "We now expect net income to be in the range of $309 million to $315 million or $4.36 to $4.44 per diluted share.", "This compares to our previous guidance of $304 million to $310 million or $4.32 to $4.40 per diluted share.", "We now expect full year sales to range between $5.1 billion and $5.17 billion compared to our previous expectation of $5.07 billion to $5.17 billion.", "Correspondingly, same store sales for the year are expected to increase 4% to 5% to our prior expectation for an increase of 3% to 5%.", "Based on the volume of our share repurchase program year-to-date, we are also adjusting our estimate for full year diluted shares outstanding to approximately 70.9 million.", "While we do not see any changes to our estimated range for capital expenditures of $240 million to $250 million, we are turning at the lower end of the range. The new store pipeline is full and we continue to track very well to our full year goal of 100 to 105 new stores.", "Inflation is tracked as expected and we continue to estimate that it will be approximately 1% to 2% for the full year, with the back half projected to be in the 0.5% to 1.5% range as we begin to cycle the high corn prices from a year ago.", "With respect to margins for the full year, we continue to expect to achieve slight gross margin rate improvement through the execution of our key gross margin initiatives.", "Also, we believe we have easier comparisons to the clearance activity we experienced last year, and we'll also be citing some emergency response activity in Q4 last year related to Hurricane Sandy.", "We expected that the mix shift to our C.U.E. products, which carry a margin rate below chain average will continue to present a headwind, but should start to moderate slightly.", "We also expect freight cost to remain a headwind due primarily to the continued mix shift to the more freight-intensive C.U.E. products, as well as increased import container volume.", "With respect to SG&A, we expect to have a drag in the second half of the year of approximately $5 million to $6 million or $0.04 to $0.05 in EPS related to the relocation of our Southeast distribution center and our corporate data center, which for the most part will be expensed in SG&A in Q3.", "We also saw an uptick in our medical and other fringe benefit expense trend line and had forecasted larger increase in the back half of the year.", "As a result of the impact of the DC and data center branches and the fringe benefit increase, we expect to have a flat to very slight SG&A leverage in the back half of the year.", "Based on the above discussion, we anticipate that our target EBIT margin improvement will be driven more by gross margin rate improvement than by SG&A leverage in the back half of the year.", "For the full year, we are increasing our forecast effective tax rate to 36.7% from our previous guidance of 36.5%. The increase relates to the higher effective state tax rates and a smaller percentage of incentive stock option disqualifications relative to a higher taxable income base this year.", "So to conclude, we again executed very well in the second quarter despite a slower start to the quarter than we would have liked. The core business is very strong and we saw seasonal sales accelerate as the weather warmed, producing solid financial results for the first half overall and positioning Tractor Supply for a healthy summer selling season.", "So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Greg.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you, Tony. Regarding the current retail environment, we have seen relatively no change from recent quarters with the behavior of our customers.", "They continue to purchase conservatively, seeking compelling values based upon need rather than want. They continue to adapt our assortments to meet their changing needs while continually elevating our in-store experience.", "Before I close, I would like to provide an update on a few of our company's current initiatives.", "Our new distribution center in Macon, Georgia, which is the relocation of our Southeastern distribution center in Braselton, Georgia is now complete and operational.", "The facility is currently receiving inventory and we expect to begin shipping to stores from this location later in the third quarter.", "Construction of our new Store Support Center in Brentwood, Tennessee, which will enable us to consolidate our 3 leased Store Support Center locations into 1 owned facility that will accommodate our growth for many years is on track, and the project is scheduled for completion in the back half of 2014.", "The functionality enhancements to our website continue, and while there is still much more to do, we are encouraged with our results thus far. We have completed the upgrades to our website for drop shipments of products from vendors to customers, our Franklin, DC is functioning well as our online in-house fulfillment center, and we are adding more SKUs each quarter to expand both the breadth and the depth of our product offerings.", "Our annual square footage growth continues at approximately 8% as we further expand into the West. We now have a number of stores open in the West, and we see more growth for this region over time.", "We currently operate stores in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and California and soon-to-be operating our first stores in Wyoming and Nevada.", "Looking forward to the second half of the year, I am confident about our plans and the forward momentum we have as a company. We are executing at a high-level, making continued progress on our sales driving and operating margin enhancing initiatives, and we are regularly introducing product newness into all our stores to ensure our customers stay highly engaged with the Tractor Supply brand.", "In closing, I would like to thank all of our Tractor Supply team members for their ongoing hard work, passion for our customers and commitment to our company, with special recognition to all our Oklahoma team members impacted by or helping those impacted by the recent tornadoes. Our team members are the driving force behind Tractor Supply's growth, and we all look forward to a successful second half of 2013.", "Operator, I would now like to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.", "Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Greg, in 5 of the past 7 quarters, gross margin rate has been flat or slightly lower. I know that you're expecting margin to improve during the second half of the year, but do you think that we're possibly at the point where the future of significant gains in gross margins maybe unwise and perhaps it's best to start returning some of those efficiencies to customers to drive market share?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Dan, great question. Let me answer it this way. The mix of our business continues to shift, in a positive way, to C.U.E., which is the foot drivers of our customer base, and really it's kind of the basis of how we structure the company, about probably back in '08 and '09 when we made some changes to some of these assortments. Gross margin rate, just a straight topic conversation, it's something that shifts between quarter based upon not only mix, but other factors and other valuables. As Tony mentioned in his comments, our direct margin is actually increasing at a very nice rate, and that's the positive side of gross margin. We're still fighting have some headwinds with freight, we're still fighting some headwinds with overall mix. We believe we'll start to normalize more of that as we get in the third and fourth quarter, as we cycle through. And I believe we have a better handle on what's happening now as we go forward. But I would agree with you that the steep incline that we've seen, maybe in the past 3 to 4 years, may not be the same as we go forward. We still are confident though we can still get the 20 basis points or so as we said each year. And remember, our new operating margin goal is still targeted at 10.5%.", "Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Right. And then just a follow-up question for Tony on the new store growth, the square footage. It looks like square footage is up about 7.3% year-over-year. In your prepared comments, you noted that it would probably wind up the year at around 8% growth. Could you discuss why the store openings, I guess, are somewhat back loaded and how that might impact your expenses in the second half of the year?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Sure. You're absolutely correct, the first half grew a little bit slower than we had originally anticipated. Some of it has to do with the wet weather and pushing back some of the stores. Some of it has to do with, obviously, some lease negotiations that pushed out some of our deals. We do anticipate easily hitting our number, of the 100 to 105, and they will be a little bit more back loaded into the October and even, potentially November timeframe. From an expense standpoint, when it comes to the preopening, those cost has been relatively flat with last year, so you, again, from a model standpoint, can predict those. And as I noted in my comments, in the first half of the year, by opening up fewer stores on a percentage basis, it has a slight impact on margin. We would expect in the back half that would help margins slightly.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Justin E. Kleber - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "It's actually Justin Kleber on for Pete. First for Greg, just on the traffic number. Obviously, another strong number here. Can you guys maybe just discuss the frequency of your average shopper or how that's evolved and changed over the past few years? Is the visitation gap between your best and maybe your average customer becoming wider? Or do you think it's narrowing?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Great question, Justin. And we typically don't talk to some of those specifics. What we can tell you is that, the number of trips that the consumer seems to be making to our store is growing. It's more consistent than it was in the past. And I think it ties us up around the C.U.E. strategy. These are consumable, usable, edible, necessary items, and as long as we can keep the customer engaged there, and I also will tell you, I think it's a gain of market share across many of those categories. We become that most dependable supplier of, that's what's driving it. So we've got some statistics. We do track our best customers at the very high-end of the scale and what I'd call probably our more moderate customer usage, and we're seeing more footsteps clearly.", "Justin E. Kleber - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, that's great. And then Tony just some clarification on the guidance. So it looks like the earnings grew by 18% in the first half of the year, on comps slightly over 4%. Your second half guidance seems to imply a comp of at least 4%, but the earnings growth looks to be about 13% at the midpoint. So is that deceleration simply the DC or data center cost and the health care issue you noted? Or is there something else that we should be aware of? Because I would've thought the inflection in gross margin you're expecting would offset some of those headwinds in the second half?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes, you're correct. The margin does -- the gross margin does offset some of the SG&A expense, but the real pull back or headwind is the anticipated cost of transitioning to full operations on the distribution center and then the subsequent relocation of our data center. And one of the big driving numbers is we're just going to be running duplicate rent for both of those locations until the end of the year. So we'll be able to cycle some of those costs as we move into next year.", "Justin E. Kleber - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. So that rent, is that included in that $0.04 to $0.05 that you called out or is that...", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes, it is. That's included, as well as there's a temporary labor that's included and there's, obviously, some handling and movement of product between the former DC, the lease location and the new location. And -- so those are really the largest expenses.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to John Lawrence with Stephens.", "John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Greg, would you comment just a little bit? You mentioned recently a lot about regional assortments. Would you talk a little bit about that and the program of how much of these stores are now getting inventory regionally versus from other methods?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "John, we have become a little bit maybe more refined than just talking about regional. We're really talking now about local, localization is really our new moniker, if you would want to call it that, and it's because as we move into different parts of the country, stores that are -- I'll give you an example, stores that are in the mountainous region versus stores that are may be in the valley, maybe in the same state, but they act very differently, the needs are very different. So I had mentioned before that we have about 600 plus different types of assortments out there on our stores based upon the locations and the regionalization. But we've not taken a step further, John. And we're now really looking at the local level, a lot more input from the management teams in the field, and we still have a lot of work to do, but we do our homework before we go into a new area of the country and we are understanding the needs of that market much better. So a lot of work there. A lot of assortment planning and planogramming work that's done well in advance to those stores' opening.", "John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Great. And secondly, left-hand side of the store, tools, et cetera. I know you've doing a lot of work there last several years. Anything to update there that's going on?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, if you've been in our stores recently, you'll note that we are expanding what we call the hardware set and we're revamping it, but we're making some moves to shift product categories around, place the new products into that area and we are -- this year, we'll be moving several hundred stores into that new format. We've tested it for a few years now, we're happy with the results and you will see the left-hand side changing a bit, and the whole hard lines component still having seasonal toward the front and then placing the hardware component in a little different setting, if you may call it, and we've also done some work in the back there within the automotive and truck and tool. So that's kind of continues to get worked.", "John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Great. Last question on cross dock on the feed. Any update there in Texas?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "The current test is complete. We're very happy with the results and we are currently beginning a process of trying to locate a facility in the same region to actually start to roll this process forward.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "First on the gross margin side. I think last quarter you had 65 basis points of pressure from the mixed shift to C.U.E. This quarter, it was 40 basis points and you have the gross -- overall gross margin degradation was about the same. Can you connect those 2 points? Did you see less of a benefit this quarter from some of your gross margin initiatives?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Michael, this is Tony. We saw actually about the same increase when it came to the direct margin piece, but there's obviously so many other variables as far as the way as we look at margin internally. So I highlighted the larger pieces, in particular, the sort of the impact that we get from the new stores and also the way we manage markdowns during a particular quarter. And then some of the programs that we put together with our vendors. So that all comes into play and can impact a particular quarter. But from a standpoint of our initiatives, they are really driving a very strong initial direct margin on the products that we're bringing in now. So we're very pleased with how that is working. And truly just of sort of relates negative or the degradation really is a result of the mix of the product.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Do the rate of improvement from -- on the direct side were similar in the second quarter to what it was in the first quarter?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Correct. It's very -- strong performance. As we look out, we're anticipating that the headwind that we do get from the C.U.E. items should start to moderate and should decrease slightly.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And why is that?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Well one, as we cycle some of the higher cost from last year. And then with the anticipation that some of the pricing will come down in some of the feed categories, in particular. You have opportunity to be able to better manage the rate. So in escalating prices, in times of escalating prices, we'll manage, as we've talked in the past, to try to get a certain dollar per bag or dollar per unit as we go through lower inflation or potentially deflation in some categories, we'll still manage to that same dollar per unit, but that dollar per unit now returns you a higher margin rate. So we believe the degradation that we'll get from that headwind will be a little bit less or start to moderate in the back half.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And then my last question on that point. We've seen some volatility in commodity prices, grain prices, corn prices, what sort of impact is that having on your customer? And what have assumed about that into the back half of the year?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes. There has been some volatility, some of it has been more conversation than actual actualization. So it's been a little bit more steady than you would suspect. As we look into the back half, like I just previously mentioned, we do expect some of the prices to be lesser than they were last year, although we have yet to see that sort of precipitous decrease in any of the particular grains that we deal with. And as I've stated previously, we would expect that, that would benefit margin rate in the back half of the year.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So will it have an impact on your -- the amount of income that your customers are going to have, such that they may have less to spend in your stores?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "It's possibility, but right now, we don't anticipate it having a significant impact. Obviously, we'll have to work through that as we see the environment and the economy in the back half of the year. But as we've said in the past, it generally has more a trickle-down effect into the economies that we deal with in the Midwest, tends to be a little bit more isolated and generally would not have a significant impact.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "One cleanup question to start with. You talked about the investment from the DC relocations, et cetera, then the expansions in the second half of the year. Did you give that number for the second quarter?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes. It was about $0.02 impact on EPS.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That's helpful. And then secondly, if you could just comment on essentially what you saw in June? Obviously, April was a challenging month given the later start to spring. We heard a lot about precipitation in June in certain parts of the country. What impact did that have on your business in the quarter and how does that set you up -- how does that influence the set up for Q3?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Well, as I had said in my comments, all 3 months were strong comps relative to, obviously, the overall quarter. And so that's the detail that we provide for June. The other thing that I would comment on is that, we believe that this year, there has been more moisture. We believe that also, when it comes to drought, it is much more isolated and it's isolated more in sort of the Southwest area of the country. And last year, it extended much more into the Midwest. So we believe that the weather conditions do provide for a little bit more extended spring/summer selling season. So we think that, that bodes well, obviously, for the June performance, as well as into some of the July performance. Now, also as an editorial, I would say that any type of spring performance does start to moderate significantly as we move into July and the August timeframe. So it becomes a much lesser portion of our sales.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Austin Pauls with RBC Capital Markets.", "Austin Pauls - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I have a couple of high-level questions on the topics of market share and competition. With respect to some of the bigger box national retailers that maybe don't focus solely on the farm and ranch segment that you do, but do have some overlap with you guys in certain product categories. Are there any signs on those retailers are seeing these strong sales growth that you have been putting up? And have any interest in expanding their assortments in those areas? And then secondly, with respect to some of your smaller more regional competitors that do focus on your core real customer, are you seeing any actions from those companies on market share, whether it's more competitive pricing or potentially even increasing their own new store growth plans?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Let me start with that first. This is Greg. Interest or signs of interest from the large box retailers that may sit around us. On occasion, we will see one of the or several of these guys that will get in to some of the businesses in a small way looking at it as a potential, I believe, potential foot driver for them. The difference is that, we're in this businesses to stay and our customers understand about Tractor Supply. So if someone else would want to jump in and jump out of the business, that doesn't make you an authority. And I think over the long haul, what we see is that customers continue to come back to us. We have not had anyone that we can tell as far as our core customer base would be moving to a big box or something like that to buy some of these products because they really don't have the expertise to talk to them and to really sell them to the consumer. The second piece about regionals. Some of the regionals, when we move in to their markets, have a tendency to do believe that it's about price. And our belief is it's about a better store, a better assortment in that store and it's about a good -- great customer experience along with a fair price. Most of them compete on a high-low basis. We do not. We compete on an everyday price basis with some promotion. So they have a tendency to try to play the price game. We will, in many cases, play the match game for a period of time. But in the overall scheme of things, we tend to win that battle and I'll also tell you that in some instances, as our growth of store base has expanded, many of what I'll call the smaller independents, who are specialty retailers in either feed, maybe it's a pet operation, maybe it's a tack operation, maybe it's something that is just in 3-point equipment. We have a tendency to be that store that can draw that consumer to one location and make the purchase versus having to go to multiple locations. So we somewhat, I guess, outman them from a standpoint of our assortments having a one-stop shop. So a number of factors, we continue to run our game and play our game and we continue to improve what we do, and I think we'll continue to win.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Could you talk a little bit about some of your progress in newer markets like Colorado, where you've been operating now for a bit over a year? Any early learnings? What do you see some of the key differences from your core markets in terms of the customers and also the competitive environment?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "This is Greg. I'll speak to that. We studied the Colorado market and we'll study any new market for a period of time before we'll open our first store. And what we found was that the consumer was being underserved in some aspects that there was some requirements that were expected of us if we were going to compete with those independents. And that will be the points of differentiation that we could exploit versus what that competitor originally was doing. And that's a little bit of a simplification of how we go about it, but we have had great success in Colorado and in a number of other states as we've expanded because of using that formula.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And going back to your 25% growth in exclusives. Could you talk about what categories are driving this. And I saw that you're advertising your expanded paint and tools assortment. Is this another opportunity to put more exclusives into the stores?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "The exclusive brand categories are growing for several reasons. One is we're offering the customer a far better value equation for their hard earned money. Secondly, there are always gaps in anyone's assortment that can't be filled by a national brand, so we're able to use our exclusive brand to fill those gaps. And I would say third, across the store, we're finding opportunities, but we don't try to force those opportunities. We test them first, let our customers respond. If they give us the positive response to allow us to take it to the next category, the next extension of products, we'll do that, and that's worked for us. We've been successful at this point and that will be our plan going forward.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "As you look at new store openings, any change in the real estate market out there? Any sense that supply is tightening or cost of sites is going up, things of that nature?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes. Chuck, Tony. We have seen that some of the rents have been increasing very modest, and it has not impacted our ability to identify locations and/or to obtain a very -- the required return that we would expect to get out of our new stores.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Do you cover that increased strength and the pricing of that individual location? Or is it sort of the overall pricing of the chain?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "It's going to vary from state to state. So we're going to see different prices in the various states. And generally, we're going to cover that through the increased sales level that we would anticipate gaining from that particular marketplace. So as an economy rebounds, if the rents rebound, we'll generally going to be able to drive some additional sales volume that would easily cover any additional rent expense that we would have to manage.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Okay. And somebody earlier might have said this, but I want to get a clarification. Did you say the new store mix in the most recent quarter skewed to a somewhat lower size?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "No. I would not say that. We opened a few less stores in the first half of the year relative to the prior year.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jeff Black with Avondale Partners.", "Jeff Black - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Just to sharpen an earlier point. Your gross margin guidance for the second half, is that premised on C.U.E. lessening as a headwind from the 40 basis points? Or is it premised on the margin initiatives you're working on kind of offsetting, in total, the C.U.E. headwind? And then on the inventory, you mentioned that we had some more carryover, but you think there's less margin risk to the carry over. Could you just clarify what's really going on with the inventory build, at least, from the 2 C.U.E. step with left over aspect?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes, Jeff, I'll take the inventory. I will let Tony talk a little bit about the gross margin. At the end of the quarter, we had already planned to have 2 facilities operating, Braselton and Macon. So we'd already indicated that there was going to be some carry of inventory, basically duplication of inventory for a period of time as we ended the quarter because we still would not be fully transitioned to Macon. So that was some of the dollars. Some of the dollars were also an investment piece that we made as we saw the quarter start to open up with sales. We said let's get ahead of it, and let's make sure that we keep the C.U.E. categories, driving businesses as they were, so we made some, I will call it, inventory investment forward, to make sure that we stayed in the stock positions we wanted. And then the last piece was something to do with -- at the end of the quarter, we had some early receipts of third quarter that actually came in about, let's say, a week early by the end of the quarter, that shifted in. That was probably the largest impact overall for the quarter. That's all forward inventory. It just arrived to about a week earlier than we would have liked, to be very honest. But the way we booked our inventories, if it's been picked up and it's in transit, it's going to get under the books. So that was the larger portion of it. But we're in great shape for our transmission out in spring into summer and fall.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "When it comes to gross margin guidance in the back half, as I have noted in the comments, we think we're up against easier compares. As Greg just mentioned, we like where we are relative to our inventory position. So we believe that as we go into the spring clearance mode, we'll be able to manage those markdowns effectively. We obviously, in the back half of the year, also are going up some emergency response from Sandy, so that last year carried a lower margin. So we believe that, that's an easier compare as well. We'll be opening up a lot of new stores in the back half that could have a slight positive impact. And then, in addition to seeing some of the impact of lower prices in some of the grains, we would anticipate that the headwind from the rate impact on margin could moderate as well, as well as the mix starting to moderate as well. So a lot of different factors affecting the back half. Obviously, I wanted to make it clear that we really expect to have some gross margin momentum in the back half that we had not experienced in the first half. And then with that additional charge for the DC and the data center impacting SG&A, the back half just -- will act a little bit differently than what we saw in the first half. I just want to make that clear to everybody.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Following up on the inflation question. You still expect about 100 bps in the back half on inflation. So is that the chemical business driving a positive move in the food category? It seems more like disinflation? And related to that can you talk about the inflation outlook in maybe the horse side versus the dog side in the food category.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes. We would anticipate that -- I mean, there's so many different categories, we're looking at over 340 different categories and they all react a little bit differently. So it's hard to isolate. We don't have anything that we're seeing that had a significant increase to it. So we're probably looking at very modest increase across the majority of the categories. And where we see sort of that offset to bring it down from what we experienced in the first half, really, is more on sort of the grain side of the business in the animal feed. So that's why we think it will be a little bit less as we look at the back half of the year.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Understood. And you would include the dog, cat -- dog food in there as well?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "No, we look at the pet food side as, generally, being flat in the back half of the year.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Understood. And then on the live goods, can you talk about how many stores that you had live goods in during the spring season where compared to last year? And how you think about the number of stores that you can and want to get that into? And do you think, eventually down the road, there is a garden center perhaps on the side of the store using up some of the yard?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Chris, this is Greg. First of all, we had limited stores in 2012. We were still going through some more testing. This year, we had an excess of 500 stores with live product. I would tell you that, we're finding that side lot, if you want to call it, which is now our area for storage, can be productive if we can place the right products there. So I won't give you an absolute on the fact that, that's where live goods may wind up and will there be a garden center there. But I will tell you that we're pleased with the results. We're still looking at how we would position the business for next year if we take it to more stores in the chain. It's a business that has to be run regionally. So we have to have the availability of the product and the growers there to be able to service it. But we do believe there's future growth in that category.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. Is it possible to assess what the longer-term penetration would be at the C.U.E. category? Is that something that you think will be growing rapidly throughout next year or how do you assess that?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, Dave, as you know it's a number of different categories. It's not just feed, food, or whatever. There's a multiple things that we have classified under C.U.E. It's really the products that we would consider would be footstep drivers and what I would consider to be the most dependable supplier of -- these are the items that customers can count on when they come to our store. Now, its overall penetration, in many ways, is growing because we are gaining market share from -- I'm going to say others around us and we're running a much more powerful business, a business that is well priced day in and day out, with our new price optimization modeling, we're able to do that. And I can't tell you today if there's a percentage or not. I can only tell you that we see further growth as we go forward, but we also saw it becoming more of a run rate of where we've been. And at this point, we're happy with it because it is bringing a lot of footsteps. You saw that with over 4% increase in transaction count. The customer should continue to come to us. Over time, that gives them the opportunity to shop other places within our store and that's where we can build more margin. So there will be a balancing act as we go through the next couple of years.", "David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And secondly, with the enhancements that you're making to the e-commerce site, any update with regard to your thinking on the ultimate profitability of that business and perhaps a penetration there too?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, even some of the most developed retailer out there that have websites, they're doing sub 3% and 4% of their overall business on the web. In my thought process about the web, it's first, just another vehicle for us to exchange either commerce information or just exchange commentary with a consumer. It's a way for us to understand what they're purchasing from us and why and how we can go back to them and talk to them about things they're interested in. The commerce side of this is a little longer term from a standpoint of its ramp and its run, because you have to have a number of things, I said earlier in my prepared comments about having capabilities. But we do believe that there'll be some business for us longer-term, but I believe what it does, it drives just -- it probably drives more business for our stores than it will probably drive online by a great margin. So the store business, we're a 4-wall retailer in this is just another way for us to exchange commerce, I believe, with the consumer. And I'm going to tell you that, we will not be probably anymore than some of the best at retail today as far as percent of overall sales.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Sorry to go back to gross margins again, but just when we're talking about the back half of the year. Really the comparison is not easy in the fourth quarter. It's not too much lower than what we saw in the second quarter. You're up 80 last year. In second quarter, you're up 50. On the run rate, in the second quarter this year, you're probably about plus 50, plus 80 and then minus 20 or something like that, plus 60. As we look to the back half of the year, is most of that improvement going to be weighted to the third quarter? And then sort of, for the year, how are you looking at gross margins? Are we looking flat for the year, are we looking slightly up? What would you say about that?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "As we look at the back half, we do see a lot -- we see a lot of the opportunity in Q3. But as we move into Q4, the one thing about Q4 is that, it is a lot of import activity. So we have a potential of driving some gross margin improvement there. The new stores that we opened in the back half of the year are weighted towards the fourth quarter as well. And then we always believe that we can go through the season more effective as far as managing the markdowns. We are hopeful that it will be a little bit colder in December and that will provide us the ability to manage through the holiday season some of our, obviously, insulated and cold weather products. So yes, we definitely recognize that it is a tough comparison as we move into the fourth quarter, but we believe that there are some variables that we can be able to react and drive margin improvement in both the third and fourth quarter.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. On the merchandise outlook, obviously, live goods was very successful for you guys in summertime this year. Any sort of new tests you're working on for the winter?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Adam, there's always new tests. I've always said there's 40 to 50 ongoing. Yes, we'll have -- we will bring -- continue to bring newness to the stores. We'll continue to have testing, but I'm really not at liberty to tell you the specifics. I can only tell you, go visit our stores, you'll find it.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Aram Rubinson with Nomura.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "A lot of questions have been asked, so I'll focus my attention on CRM. I know you guys have been working hard on understanding the makeup of your customer more over time. Can you tell us a little bit more about what you've learned so far. Specifically, I'm interested in the distribution of kind of customer and visits and your best customers representing x percent of sales. I was wondering if you can give any inklings there. And then I have a follow-up.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Let me give you some insight. This is Greg. We are spending quite a bit of time on understanding our consumer, and we have developed a 5-year roadmap, which we are now in the initial stages of starting to roll into that plan. The first thing we understood we got to do was pull all of our data together on our customers. And we have it in a number of, I'll call it, buckets here in the company. So we're doing that merge right now. Once we have that information, we'll be able to start talking to this customer and looking and cross-referencing as they buy 1 category, are they buying another category? And if they're not buying into that category, why aren't they and so on and so forth. And we have some current learnings through some of the initial merge of some of the information. We actually use that in the middle part of this year, during the July 4 period. We did change some distribution using that information and we had very, very positive results. So we know the power of it. The matter of fact is we have to start to harness that. So that's going to take some time, but we do have a very rigorous process we put into place. We are in the first stages and now doing that, first consolidation, and we'll be able to share more with you as time develops.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And if I can just follow up in the absence of kind of science on the CRM side, you've got kind of art, which testing and experimentation. And some of those tests are working and some of are not working. So if we can use that as a proxy for CRM. Can you tell us about where you see your bandwidth with customers? Where do you see them kind of -- are there any obscure tests that are succeeding are any obvious wins that are failing? Just curious kind of where you're getting permission from that customer and kind of roughly shortcomings in that regard too?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "What I can tell you is that in some of our current learnings, we were spending some time, about a year ago, talking about the aware non-shopper. And we weren't sure if this was a suburban or if this was a more suburban rural type of consumer that lived out on the edge. I can tell you what we found out in our current research is they actually live much closer to the store than we thought. These are these customer that don't shop us, but would have an interest to shop us if they understood what was inside the box. So that's just one segment of a number of things that we have learned, how we're going to market them will be different, how we will attract them to the store will be different than our core customers who already know us and who already spend money with us. But it's exciting news, and I'm very anxious to get more of this information and to take this data and convert it into information that we can use across the company.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Greg, on price optimization, I think in the past we've talked about 4 phases or 4 components to it. I think promotional being the second bucket, and I think if I've got it right, that's kind of where the company is at or starting to pursue. Can you put some time frame parameters around it? And then I'm not sure if 1 bucket of price optimization is more opportunistic than others, but where this one stands relative to others?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, first, let me set you straight on this price op, we're in the regular price component today, continuing to learn, continuing to refine. The second bucket is really around clearance, because it's the other component of our business. Since we do have some seasonal categories, we'll move the clearance next. Third, and the most difficult will be promotion, because we're not a highly promotional company and when we do run promotion, whether it be something in preprint or on the Internet or with a coupon or whatever, there's a lot of variables there. So that, really, is the most difficult. We will -- we are looking forward into 2014 to start to work in the clearance bucket. And there's no exact timing yet because there's still some system upgrades we'll need to do, but it looks like we'll continue to stay with Revionics and we'll be looking at the end of 2014.", "Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a quick one for Tony. You mentioned the incentive comp program that it provided leverage. Was that because of the program design? Or is it because, I think in the comments, that sales you expected to be a little bit stronger and maybe some of those numbers just weren't hit.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "No. It's really generally how the program is designed each year as we go into the year and put forth what we believe are fairly aggressive targets both on a sales and an operating level for our team members out in the stores. We should be able to benefit from the incentive compensation program. This year is a little unique because of the way the sales fell last year versus this year and we had such a strong first quarter and how we level out the incentive compensation. But coming into this quarter, being a fairly strong sales quarter with the shift relative to last year, we did expect the incentive compensation to increase relative to sales level, which it did. But again, with the more aggressive targets we come in with at the beginning of the year, still provide us the opportunity to leverage that program.", "Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And if I can just clarify, I mean if the business does a 7% comp, let's say, in the future. Does the program -- is the program designed to provide leverage?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "At a 7% comp year-over-year, you'll probably have very limited leverage from the incentive compensation. There's a combination, you have to look at both pieces, one is the store piece and then one is the Store Support Center. Over a course of the year, at 7%, it will provide leverage because at a store support level -- Store Support Center level, the incentive compensation is capped at a particular point. So net-net, overall, you should get some leverage at a 7% comp, and it's designed where the shareholder will benefit from a strong selling season.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I just have one quick follow-up. Your account payables days are starting to stretch again after a long period of some compression. Has there ever been a change in philosophy around AP timing? Or is this more of a product mix issue? And what impact could that have on the gross margin rate going forward?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes, Matt. There hasn't really been a change in the philosophy. We obviously try to be as aggressive as possible when it comes to the accounts payable and the payment terms. What you see is -- included in the accounts payable is not only just merchandise payables, but also expense payables. Some of what you're seeing is timing. You also see, as we sort of lap versus last year, a little bit more consistency in that build because they're more comparable periods. Last year was a difficult comparison because we had added the extra week from the 53rd week before. So they weren't really apples-to-apples comparison. As we go through this year, there will be some spikes as we go through and we see quicker turns on some of our C.U.E. items that generally will hold back the accounts payable and we will not be able to get the leverage that we like to get out of the accounts payable. But to the basis of your question, there has not been a significant either philosophical approach or change the way the accounts payable is managed.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "The increased or slightly increased sales guidance for the year, can you just talk a little bit what is within that, if that's market or market share growth or if there's anything within specific categories that's contributing to that?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes, Eric. It really relates to the strength of the C.U.E. product and the performance of the C.U.E. throughout the first half of the year. So the majority of the sales driver is related to what we believe has been sales above expectations for the first half. And then to certain extent, a little bit lesser extent, the back half relative to the trend that we've seen when it comes to the performance of the base functional C.U.E. items.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And is that -- the C.U.E. category growing faster? Are you gaining incremental share? And if it's share, are there specific areas where you feel like you're making the most progress?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "No. We're definitely at the combination of increased trips from our current consumer, as well as additional market share.", "Operator", "And there are no other questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Okay. Thank you, operator. As you can see, we're very passionate about our business and the opportunities that's still are ahead of us. We will continue to focus on our strategies to drive sales and grow operating profits. Thank you, all, for your continued interest and support of Tractor Supply Company, and we all look forward to reporting third quarter results in about 90 days.", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone.

Greg, please go ahead.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you, Randy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Tractor Supply and for being on our call today. Our CFO, Tony Crudele, is with me on today's call. And after our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.", "We were very pleased with our strong third quarter results and we -- with the continued momentum in our business. We reacted appropriately to an extended spring and summer selling season, and our stores were well stocked with the right products and the right inventory levels.", "Mild temperatures and the right product assortment drove strong sell-through of consumable, usable, edible C.U.E. products; seasonal merchandise; and in turn, that led to the strong comps, fewer seasonal clearance markdown and a significant improvement in gross margin rate. We believe we are well positioned heading into the all-important holiday season, and we will continue to execute our sales and margin-enhancing initiatives.", "Now let me provide a brief update on some of those initiatives. On the merchandise side, we are focused on continuing to drive foot traffic with our unique assortment of new and everyday maintenance products that fit our customer's lifestyle. Our C.U.E. program, which spans all 5 of our major categories of business, continues to perform very well and is driving sales over a wide variety of need-based products. In addition to food and feed, we saw strong third quarter sales in items such as twines, sprayers and chemicals and pet supplies, which are all C.U.E. items.", "While C.U.E. continued to drive both traffic and sales, we also saw strength in several seasonal big-ticket categories. In particular, sales of outdoor power equipment performed well during the quarter, benefiting from the extended spring and summer selling season as compared to last year. We continue to grow our lawn and garden programs. And with our increased focus on supporting local needs, we've expanded our lawn and garden offerings into our southern stores on a year-round program, and initial response has been very positive with the southern stores performing well in the third quarter.", "Also in the third quarter, we ran our annual pet appreciation week event. We refer to this as PAW in our stores. This was a weeklong event devoted to supporting the health, well being and safety of pets. Stores partnered with local agencies and community groups to offer adoptions and awareness programs throughout the week and weekend, and we promoted the event through our circulars and offered pet-related merchandise special offerings throughout the week. The PAW event, it drives awareness around our pet category and demonstrates our commitment to our customers towards supporting local agencies. We are becoming a destination store for pet food and care, and continue to broaden our customer reach in all of these categories. Exclusive brands represented approximately 31% of sales versus 25% in last year's third quarter. Our 4health line of dog food continues to be a top performer, and we are experiencing growth in our JobSmart line of hand tools and our GroundWork line of lawn and garden products as well.", "Now as we talk to the margin, on that side of the business, we're executing around 4 primary initiatives: inventory management, our seasonal conversion, price optimization, exclusive brands, and then strategic sourcing. We felt that we had the right product and inventory levels in our stores in the third quarter, which allowed us to benefit again from that extended spring and summer selling season, and we ended the quarter with far less seasonal clearance-related merchandise. We're very pleased with the progress in each of our margin-enhancing initiatives, and we believe we have plenty of opportunities still ahead.", "Now turning to new store growth. During the quarter, we opened our first store in Nevada, and our first store in Rawlins, Wyoming is scheduled to open this coming Saturday, that marking the 48th state of operation for Tractor Supply. We continued to be delighted with the performance of all of our new stores, and plan to continue to grow our square footage by 8% annually for the foreseeable future.", "We began servicing stores from our new distribution center in Macon, Georgia in the third quarter of this year. This new facility replaced our older distribution center that was nearing the end of its lease in Braselton, Georgia. The Macon DC houses a new direct import center, giving us more capacity for growth with import merchandise, and it is located closer to the port of Savannah, which is an important location for transportation cost and processing of direct import merchandise. Our teams worked tirelessly during the distribution center move, and we want to recognize them for their hard work and dedication. So a big thank you goes out to our General Manager, Kyle, and all the team members there in Macon, Georgia for a job really well done.", "I continue to be delighted with our cross-functional team's ability to execute as a result of the hard work, the smart work and the collaboration across the company. Our Store Support Center, distribution center and store teams continue to improve our processes while we focus on growing our overall business.", "I will now turn the call over to Tony to review our financial results and discuss our full year outlook. Then I'll have a few closing comments before proceeding to Q&A. Tony?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 28, 2013, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 13.4% to $1.2 billion and net income grew by approximately 29% to $65 million or $0.46 per diluted shares. Comp store sales increased 7.5% in the third quarter compared to an increase of 2.9% in the last year's third quarter.", "As Greg mentioned, as a result of the late spring, ground moisture and mild temperatures, we experienced an extended spring selling season. Subsequently, we had solid sell-through in some of our key spring-summer categories, resulting in strong sales, limited seasonal markdowns and very strong year-over-year gross margin improvement.", "The animal and pet categories continued to perform well with strong comps that were above chain average. Seasonal categories such as live goods, certain gardening categories, outdoor living, riding lawnmowers and repair all performed very well.", "Comp transaction count increased for the 22nd consecutive quarter, gaining 6.7% on top of a 2.6% increase last year. C.U.E. items and the strength of the seasonal business drove traffic, and we remain pleased with our ability to drive repeat traffic into our stores for the everyday needs of our customers. Average comp ticket increased by 0.8% versus last year's 0.2% increase. The increase was primarily driven by inflation. Although big-ticket items performed well, it was not a significant driver of the average ticket increase.", "A few key points about the quarter. July and August were the strongest comp months as we experienced the extended spring. September, while a solid positive comp, was the softest comp month as temperatures remained warm, limiting sales of cold weather and heating products in the latter part of the month.", "On a regional basis, sales were strong across all regions. Big-ticket delivered a solid comp sales increase just slightly below the chain average. Riding lawnmowers, storage and trailers are examples of big ticket items that performed well. This was offset by sales of emergency response items as we cycled Hurricane Isaac and early quarter mid-Atlantic power outages in the third quarter of 2012.", "As we had anticipated, we saw inflation moderate as we cycled the high grain prices from last year. We estimate that the inflation impact on sales was approximately 100 basis points. We believe the limited impact from inflation further supports the strength of the quarter's comp sales.", "Sales of direct import items increased 28% versus Q3 last year and represented 10.5% of the sales mix in the quarter. Sales of exclusive branded products were also very strong in the quarter, increasing 26% year-over-year and representing approximately 31% of total sales.", "Turning now to gross margin, with -- which increased approximately 90 basis points to 34.4%. As we had discussed in the last conference call, we were cycling against limited gross margin improvement in the quarter last year, and we believe that the extended spring-summer selling in Q3 would assist us in better managing our clearance markdowns. This, in addition to our gross margin initiatives, resulted in strong gross margin gains in the quarter.", "So a few additional comments around gross margin. Our initial direct margin continues to improve as a result of our initiatives around price optimization, markdown management and strategic sourcing. The margin pressure from the merchandise mix shift of C.U.E. moderated, as we cycled against the higher inflation last year. We estimate that the mix had a negative impact of approximately 25 basis points on gross margin. As we cycled the higher grain prices last year and maintained gross margin dollars per unit, gross margin percentage is more stable. Freight as a percent of sales was essentially flat compared to the prior year, as favorable mix offset increased import activity.", "For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, was 26.2% of sales, reflecting 23 basis points of improvement from the prior year's quarter. As we had discussed in the past, we are focused on driving operating profit dollars. Although our increasing mix of C.U.E. sales negatively impacts gross margin rate, it drives sales growth and that allows us greater leverage of SG&A expenses. So we continue to effectively manage and leverage store-level operating expenses. And although we had a solid SG&A leverage as a result of the strong comp sales, it was offset by 2 factors: First, due to the strong results, we increased our full-year estimate and correspondingly increased our accrual for incentive compensation, which had a deleveraging impact on SG&A; secondly, we estimate that the additional costs related to our D.C. and data center relocations negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.02 for the third quarter. We estimate this had approximate 40 basis point deleveraging impact on SG&A.", "Our effective income tax rate increased to 36.1% in Q3 compared to 35.5% last year. The increase was due principally to higher effective state tax rates and reduced federal tax credits, as well as a smaller percentage of incentive stock option disqualifications relative to a higher taxable income base.", "Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q3, we had cash balance of $46 million compared to $70.2 million last year. We had outstanding short-term debt of $40 million compared to 0 last year as we build inventory for the fall-winter season. During the third quarter, under the stock repurchase program, we acquired approximately 350,000 shares split-adjusted for $21.3 million. Our stock performed very well during the quarter, which limited the purchases under our matrixed 10b5-1 plan, and we estimate that the share repurchase program did not have a material impact on EPS for the quarter.", "Average inventory levels per store at quarter end were 2.8% higher than last year, while annualized inventory turns increased by 1 basis point and 3 basis points for the quarter and the year-to-date, respectively. We are pleased with the productivity of inventory during the quarter, and we exited the season in great shape. This increase in the per store inventory year-over-year resulted from the early receipts of Q4 seasonal merchandise and additional inventory to support the transition to our relocated Southeast distribution center.", "CapEx for the quarter was $58.2 million compared to $45.6 million last year. We opened 23 stores and closed 1 during the quarter compared to 17 store openings and 1 closing in the third quarter of 2012. The increase in capital spend relates to the increase in the new store openings in the quarter.", "Turning to the outlook. As a result of our stronger-than-expected operating performance in the third quarter, we are increasing our net income expectation for the full year 2013. We now expect net income to be in the range of $317 million to $322 million or $2.24 to $2.27 per diluted share. This compares to our previous guidance of $309 million to $315 million or $2.18 to $2.22 per diluted share. We now expect full year sales to range between $5.12 billion and $5.17 billion compared to our previous expectation of $5.1 billion to $5.17 billion.", "Correspondingly, same-store sales for the year expected to increase 4.2% to 5% compared to our prior expectation for an increase of 4% to 5%. Based on the limited volume of share repurchases year-to-date and the stock split, we are also adjusting our estimate for full year diluted share outstanding to approximately 141.7 million.", "We expect to open 100 to 102 stores this fiscal year. We have reduced our estimate for capital expenditures to a range of $210 million to $220 million as the timing of the expenditures for our new Store Support Center have been less than we forecasted, and several projects requiring CapEx have been reset for 2014.", "Inflation has tracked as expected, and we continue to estimate that it will be approximately 1% to 2% for the full year with the fourth quarter being relatively flat as we cycle the higher corn prices from a year ago and experience slight deflation in some categories.", "With respect to sales. We are well positioned heading into the fall and winter season, but we expect that moderating inflation and this prospect of deflation in certain categories will be a slight headwind to comp sales in the fourth quarter. Also impacting sales comparisons in the fourth quarter will be the shortened holiday selling period as a result of the shift of Thanksgiving holiday, which creates 1 less week between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year compared to last year.", "Also in the fourth quarter, we'll be cycling against the effects of Hurricane Sandy, which we estimated last year was approximately 30 basis points of comp sales attributable to emergency response merchandise. We expect weather conditions to be somewhat neutral compared to last year, although October has been warmer than last year, and we look forward to the colder weather.", "With respect to gross margin, we expect to continue to achieve gross margin rate improvement for the fourth quarter and the full year through the execution of our key gross margin initiatives. We do not expect the increase in Q4 to be the same -- of the same magnitude as Q3. Gross margin will benefit slightly from cycling some of the lower margin emergency response activity in Q4 last year related to Hurricane Sandy. Also, gross margin will benefit slightly from the increased number of new stores opened in the second half of the year. We still expect that the mix shift in freight cost will continue to be a headwind, but we expect this to be more modest, similar to the third quarter results.", "With respect to SG&A, we expect the remaining drag related to relocation of the Southeast distribution center and our corporate data center, which is principally related to the duplicated occupancy expense, will decrease to approximately $0.01 in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we expect EBIT margin increase in the fourth quarter to be driven by improvements in gross margin and, to a lesser extent, SG&A leverage. For the full year, we are reducing our forecasted effective tax rate to 36.6% from our previous guidance of 36.7%. The decrease results primarily from the reversal of various reserves for uncertain tax positions.", "Although we will provide full year guidance at our year-end conference call, consistent with our past practices, I want to highlight a few factors to consider in preparing your models for 2014. We will be transitioning next year to our new corporate Store Support Center. We'll be consolidating 3 leased facilities, and we'll incur lease write-off and various transition costs. As the Affordable Care Act rolls out, we forecast the medical expense will increase as the result of increased enrollment, along with the various charges that are embedded in the act.", "Also as we continue to expand out west, it is a longer supply chain and we will incur additional stem miles, which makes freight a slight headwind. We initially estimate that these 3 factors could have a $0.04 to $0.05 drag in 2014. Of course, we will better quantify these items when we provide our 2014 guidance on our fourth quarter call.", "So to conclude, we are very pleased with our execution in the quarter, and we believe that we took advantage of the extended spring-summer selling season. This is supported by the improvement across all key metrics that we just discussed, and we believe that we are well positioned to finish the year strong and deliver another great year.", "So with that, I will turn the call back to Greg.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you, Tony. As Tony said, we are very pleased with the way our business performed in the third quarter. We ended the quarter in solid shape from both the merchandise and inventory perspective, and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the fourth quarter business ahead.", "While there is a lot of discussion about the current retail environment, we continue to see little change in the needs-based purchasing behavior of our consumers. Our business has evolved into a 12-month business, which today, is impacted less by seasonal, weather or micro trends the way it was a few years ago. We have become very efficient at managing inventory to address changes in weather, consumer preference and merchandise trends. In fact, we believe our ability to merchandise our stores with the right product at the right time has become a strategic advantage for Tractor Supply, and we remain really confident in our ability to execute our business over the long term.", "We are focused on driving operating profit dollars across the organization and maximizing return on capital. Sales, gross margin, expense leverage, inventory productivity and capital allocation are all important to driving capital returns, and we will continue to take a balanced approach to managing these variables and driving shareholder value.", "Operator, we would now like to open the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Alan Rifkin with Barclays.", "Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Question on the private label. I mean, it sounds like it increased by 600 basis points in the quarter alone. What do you think is the opportunity for continued increases on the private label side? And how much of a contribution to the gross margin gains did that private label increase give you?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Alan, this is Greg. Two things to talk to. One is, even though we had a very nice increase in our exclusive brand sales component for the quarter, I'm really reluctant to say that there's a number that we're reaching toward. And the reason I feel that way is that as we have grown these categories and we see the customer giving us the positive nod to their pocket book, their spend, it gives us confidence to take it out another ring. So even though we're sitting a little over 30%, the number is really hard to peg because it does vary by category, and sometimes by season of the year. The second thing is we don't usually comment about what kind of contribution margin is giving us out of the exclusive brands, but I can tell you that there's a range of hundreds of basis points improvement between what we can do on our own as we build it and source it and put it into our stores versus buying it as a national brand. And there's no question that there's been some significant movement in the direct margin side, which is really the first margin as we bring that product into our stores. Now the bottom line is, you have to sell it at pretty much the regular price. It has to be a good value to the customer in order for you to achieve the margin rates and take that to the bottom line. But we're very comfortable in the way we source the product today, build the product today that we're giving high quality, great value, and that's why we believe it's doing as well as it is.", "Operator", "We'll go next to David Magee with SunTrust.", "Lynda Guthmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "This is Lynda Guthmann in for David. We just -- our first question is just what sort of approach you guys are taking towards holiday this year versus last year?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Lynda, this is Greg again. We approach every season with, I guess, a new set of challenges and opportunities that we see in front of us. We are being conservative from a standpoint of looking at our sales trends throughout the year. We use a process in our company called correction of error that we use every season as we go through it. And we're using that -- those data points that we captured last year, and that's how we built our plan for this fourth quarter. So what I would tell you is we see opportunities. We believe that trends in some of our businesses will continue through fourth quarter. And the all-important day after Thanksgiving weekend for us is a good indicator as to how the consumer will spend through the remainder of the holiday season. But we're feeling fairly positive right now about this season.", "Lynda Guthmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just a follow-up question. Are you seeing any weakness in stores that are maybe in a lower demographic?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "No. I would tell you that we track all of our stores' sales and performances throughout. And I can't say, honestly, that we've seen any shift in our sales in markets that are maybe a little less demo.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So a question for you. You expanded the lawn and garden in the southern states into a year-round program. Can you talk about what exactly that means? Is that some of the plant categories as well? Is that keeping grass seed and fertilizer in stock? And can you maybe dimensionalize how many stores that is currently versus what it was a year ago?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Chris, this is Greg. First of all, yes, we -- you mentioned a few things that we're staying in business in those categories in a limited number of stores. What we basically have done is expanded some programs and live goods. We have maintained some of the plan-o-grams in the areas where you're going to see like insect repellants and fertilizers and different things of that nature that continue to be products people use in those markets throughout the year. It's several hundred stores that this program has stayed in this year, and we gave it the appropriate attention when it came to inventory support because we were hearing from our stores every year, \"Listen, we're exiting the seasons too early. For us, there's some products we should carry year round.\" It's been a nice addition to the business. It really is just addressing the consumers' needs in those markets. That's what we've done.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then as you maybe peel back the second quarter, and I know you're talking about some commentary on October. But what do you think like if you took out the extended season, what's sort of the baseline comp in the business, and is that what you're highlighting as you talk about the consistency of performance that you've seen?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes. Chris, this is Tony. When we look at -- it's obviously hard to break out some of the pieces in the business. A lot of what we look at is we'll segregate categories that we call year-round categories versus the seasonal categories. And it clearly was a solid split between those categories. So we felt that we had some significant drivers in both the foot traffic generation, as well as the sort of add-ons that we got from the spring selling season. I think, when you look at this year and last year, as we went through the first 9 months, we have a very comparable sort of 5%, 5.5% comp in both years. So it really represents the seasons throughout the first 9 months. And as we talked about, sometimes we will just have a shift between the quarters. But as you look at us on a full year basis, we look at it as very consistent performance.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then finally, you mentioned $0.04 to $0.05 drag next year from some of those items that you had listed out. The consolidation of the 3 centers into the 1 corporate support center, could you perhaps share how much of the $0.04 to $0.05 that is? And is that representative of maybe how you think about the rent savings that you're going to have on a go-forward basis from consolidating?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes. At this point in time, we really didn't want to get into any specifics or details. What I was trying to do, Chris, was to make sure that as you model into next year, I know a lot of the analysts are looking at onetime charges this year, and obviously, looking at them as one-time and adding back to next year. And I just wanted to make it clear that there are a few other things as we enter into next year that will also provide a headwind. So again, I wanted to keep it top level in general. I want to be able to, at least, have some discussions as we go out in the last quarter so that you have a little bit of lead time when it comes to doing your modeling. I would tell you that relative to the transition, it's a good portion of that number. But as we get closer to the conference call next time and we give full guidance, we might be able to provide a little bit more specifics as to those numbers.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to John Lawrence with Stephens.", "John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Can you comment a little bit on Alan's question on the exclusive labels? Obviously, that rate -- the process for several years has been to do a lot of tests in the stores. We've seen a lot of that over the years. Has that either -- can you just talk about that process? Are there more tests, or have we just gotten more tests in certain levels or in the sixth or seventh inning of the game and that are being more successful, or just talk about that process a little bit?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "John, the testing process has been something that we have focused on for the last probably 3 years. And Steve and the team continued to bring new things to the store, whether it's in the center court, where we use the drive aisle areas, the end caps, or sometimes even 4-foot section resets, and it's limited. In groupings of stores, we don't push it across the company until we can prove the test to be successful. But we -- I would say, you're never in any inning when it comes to testing, because there's always new products, new things to be tried. You're always trying to stretch the envelope, and we have a philosophy here of fail often, early and cheaply. And so we're going to continue to push that strategy and bring our customers, the latest, the greatest and some of the more novel things that are out there in the market. And I would tell you that not all of them fall under the banner of exclusive brands. Some do, some don't. Some are some things that Steve and the team will find through our process of these vendor days that they have here, where we -- 3 or 4 days we dedicate 3 times a year, and new vendors come in and show us new products, and we make some selections and we try and test things. So process is healthy. Process is well run. It's well oiled. We're probably now in our fourth year of it, and it's just going to get better with time.", "John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Great. And second question, can you tell me about your comments on big-ticket? Was that across the board regionally, and what were some of those areas that might have surprised you late in the quarter?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Big-ticket sales was, for the most part, yes, across the board in every region. And I think we weren't surprised by what we saw in outdoor power equipment because we saw the season extending. And I don't know that I would say there was really any major surprises there. I like the fact that we saw some push in our tool business and we saw some push in our garden tool business, the hand tool and garden tool business, which leads me to believe that consumers are understanding the value proposition that we're giving them in our store. So really no surprises, just delighted with the results.", "Operator", "We'll go now to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "The first question is do you think you cannibalize fourth quarter sales at all just due to the strong 3Q results, number one? Number two, can you just talk about the decline we've seen in corn prices? And is that one of the categories Tony was referencing in terms of where we might see some deflation?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Scot, a couple of things. I don't believe we cannibalize fourth quarter at all. There's a complete shift in the business as the weather starts to turn. We were just capitalizing on an extended, I'll call it, spring-summer season, and that helped us in third along with the C.U.E. businesses continuing to perform well. As far as corn prices and what Tony was referring to in the inflation-deflation component, yes, we're seeing a little bit of that in the mixture of some of our products. But remember, corn is not the primary ingredient in everything that we sell. It is a component of some things, but not all. So it does have some impact more in the feed business than probably any place else.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So where else would you be seeing deflation then? I thought that would be the natural, but it sounds like there might be something else then?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Generally, if we see deflation, it most likely will be in those categories.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Lasser with UBS.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "First on the gross margin performance in the third quarter. If you parse it out, how much do you think was sustainable driven by some of the initiatives within the company and how much was due to the late, extended spring selling season?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Well, Michael, obviously, there's a lot of overlap there. And I think we'd be doing a disservice trying to break out the component in those, to that extent. I can clearly tell you that all 3 were a driver as far as the margin goes, and it sort of really worked in tandem, all 3. I got all 4, were drivers in the -- as far as the initiatives go. But overall, the only aspect that I would always caution as far as the year-over-year is clearly the clearance piece and how we manage that year-over-year. So generally, the initiatives will drive and will be carried forward and sustainable. However, as we go through seasons, I think we've benefited significantly as we had the extended season and we had very successful inventory management and exit out of the season.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And a second question on the inflation-deflation piece. How long is typically the lag time between commodity price changes and what the experience is in your business? My question is really trying to get at, could you actually see deflation on your comp from commodity prices moving into 2014?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "This is Greg, Michael. There's always that risk that as prices come down, we have to sell one point x times more units to offset the volume from a year ago. One of the things we track closely and we look at it, and we talk about this a lot is market share growth, market share growth. And so even though we may be moving down in retail price, we have that methodology here and it's pretty rigorous, that as we see prices -- the input prices start to come down, we stair-step down our retail prices. And sometimes we hold onto some of that margin. We don't give it all back because in many cases, we can be the leader of price in some of these categories with the amount of stores we have across the country now. So I would tell you that we do a very good job of managing deflation and inflation when it happens. We are very sticky on our retail, and we look for trying to take every penny to the bottom line if we can.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Michael, this is Tony. Let me just add that what's important to note is as much as we may have some headwinds on the sales line, when we have deflation, the gross margin rate will show improvement. Just as we had talked in the past when we have the inflation, the gross margin rate is a little bit more difficult to manage. So as management, it is our responsibility to be able to manage through both that inflation and deflation period. But as much as there may be pressure on the top line, we believe that we can benefit on the gross margin line.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And you're not particularly concerned because you do have some discrete expense items coming up at the turn of calendar with Obamacare, the headquarters move, that you'd get pinched a little bit if you do see deflation and then some inflation in your cost structure? It's not an excessive risk to be mindful of?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "At this point in time as we model it out, we're not overly concerned. Obviously, it depends as to the magnitude that we see. But as we move forward, we have shown, as through '08 and '09, that we can effectively manage through a deflationary period.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Dan Wewer with Raymond James.", "Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "More of a long-term question. In some of your recent meetings conferences, you've been talking more about e-commerce opportunities for Tractor Supply. I mean, frankly, when I think about your business and the bulky products, it looks to me that last mile delivery is a big challenge, but what am I missing? I mean, what do you see as an omni-channel opportunity for Tractor, how it could begin to play out in the next few years?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, first, let me say that it will be a slow ramp, because you are right. There are challenges with many of the products we sell. If we felt we could move those through a supply chain and to the customer cost effectively, it is challenging. However, that being said, there's a tremendous amount of traffic that's coming to our site for information, first; for exchange of information, second. So it's information about products, then they're exchanging information amongst themselves. The customers are talking between themselves. And there are things that we can execute from a delivery to the consumer, either it's drop ship or it's buy online, pick up at store, variations of that, that can work very effectively for Tractor Supply. Our challenge is going to be getting the SKU base structure out there appropriately, and then understanding the cost component of moving that product through our supply chain or from the manufacturer to the customer. And those are -- that's a mixture of variables. It's not like dealing with jewelry or apparel. We have everything in this store, so there are some categories where it will be much more difficult, some categories where it will be fairly easy. I believe that there's a long tail portion for us longer term that could be very beneficial. A customer is coming to tractorsupply.com and saying \"I'm looking for a unique part for a 1953 9N Ford tractor. Where would I look for it? Well, I'll go to tractorsupply.com.\" And we can pop things up and through our alliances with other manufacturers, be able to have an availability of product there for the customer to choose from. They click buy from us, it's fulfilled from that manufacturer. So I could go on and on about what I believe, Dan, this can be, but it will be a slow ramp. I do think there's a lot of benefit here. And one thing you can't forget about is the social aspect of what's going on with the websites right now. We have a social aspect to our company already. If you ever shop in our stores, and you see how our customers interact with one another and the team members, that's translating to the web. And we're cognizant of that in making sure that we're playing -- going to play in that space effectively.", "Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And just one other separate question. During your prepared comments, you were talking about, I believe you called it, the PAW program. This is relating more to domestic pets, right, dogs and cats?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes. Pet awareness week is basically what PAW means.", "Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Is this part of your animal business actually becoming bigger and growing faster?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "What I would comment to is that I think more customers are starting to discover Tractor Supply as a store that, even though the name says Tractor Supply, there are a number of products inside that they would buy from us. And some of this is word of mouth, some of this is through some of our testing of some new marketing methodologies, but we are and can be a store for many more people than just this core rural customer. And I think that's where we're seeing some of this growth.", "Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So just for people who live in smaller towns that -- who have dogs and cats that you're recognizing that as an opportunity?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes. I think, they may have been shopping at the local pet store, and now they're saying, \"Tractor Supply is a great option.\"", "Operator", "And we'll go now to Mark Miller with William Blair.", "Mike Signore", "This is actually Mike Signore for Mark. I know in the Q&A, you kind of mentioned you were pleased with the new store performance. I'm wondering if you could just maybe elaborate on that since you have entered a bunch of new markets here more recently.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Certainly. As we've headed west, we've just been very pleased with the performance of those stores. And as we backfill as well, we just feel that the stores come out a lot stronger. We understand the markets better and we've been getting the right merchandise there. So we're really pleased with the performance of the stores, and they continue to beat the pro formas in which we've established for them.", "Mike Signore", "Okay. I mean, when you look at like the new stores over the past couple of quarters versus maybe the new stores last year, I mean, are they performing better than those? Because I guess, when we look at the calculated new-store productivity number, it actually looks a little bit lower. So I'm wondering if that's just kind of a mathematical thing based on what you're saying. It sounds like it would be.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "It should be mathematical. Both years have been very good years for us and they've performed very similarly.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just want to talk about your traffic growth for a minute because, I mean, your growth was just so impressive there. So I'm wondering if you really saw a really meaningful contribution from new customers, the aware non-shopper perhaps coming in for pet supplies as you were just talking about. Or were you mainly seeing increased frequency of trip by existing customers?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Denise, this is Greg. We can track existing customers a lot easier than we can track new customers, to be very honest, unless they come in to the -- some promotional event that we've done and we can, through bar coding, be able to know that they are a new customer to file. I can tell you this, we are seeing increased footsteps from the customer base we have, which leads me to believe that we are becoming more of their sole destination and they're spending more of their wallet with us. We are still working on some of the new customer acquisition strategies. And at this point in time, I don't have much to talk to you about that. But that is also another piece of the focus.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Denise, this is Tony. When we look at and talk to vendors and get data points, it's very clear that we are taking market share. So there is a good portion of new customers that we're attracting.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And also wanted to follow up on private label. You said that it varies by category and by season. So could you kind of walk us through that a little bit, where and when penetration is heaviest and lightest?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, ironically, the penetration is not that different, really, spring to fall because the categories shift, but I'll give you an example. In the spring season, you may have GroundWork's products in -- all across the garden categories. In the fall, you may have products in heating that you wouldn't see in the spring season. So these are some of the changes that occur between spring and fall. Now I'll just give you 2 examples. There's many more, but that's some of the things we have to -- we consider. And there are some brands that run across the store every day like C.E. Schmidt. You'll see spring apparel and footwear there. You'll also see fall apparel and footwear in those brands. So it's a combination really of all 3.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And just lastly, as you expanded into new markets like Colorado and Nevada, are you seeing any kind of competitive response? And can you talk about maybe how mix and seasonality might be different in these markets? I mean, what are some of the nuances that you're finding in these newer markets?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I can speak to this. Tony will probably chime in. Typically what happens when we go into a new market, before we go, we do our research, and we look at a couple of things. One is what is the current competition doing and doing well? So we have to be able to match up. Secondly, where are their gaps? Where are they vulnerable? And we look for those. And then we put -- we kind of make that decision. Then the third piece is, we say, \"Where do we, as Tractor Supply, win and where can't they compete with us?\" And to be honest, it's still early in the game in the West to say that everything that we're learning as we go into these markets, we've got it figured it out. But I will tell you that we've had great success using some of this formula going into new markets and getting these stores as close to right as we can with assortment and then some of our marketing approaches. We also do something quite different with adding a new store team that babysits these new stores for that first year and listens to their needs and the wants from the customers that possibly we could have missed when we first opened. So it's a pretty thorough process.", "Operator", "We have Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.", "Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "So the question I got just on -- you mentioned big-ticket in your prepared remarks and in response to some of the questions. So maybe just revisit that again. How much per contributor to the comps was big-ticket? And if you look at big-ticket here in the third quarter, did it differ significantly from what we saw earlier in the year?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes. When it comes to big-ticket, like I had stated in the prepared remarks, it was just slightly under the chain average. So as a percent of the total, it didn't impact the overall comp significantly. And as I alluded to in the comments as well, when it comes to the average ticket itself, it just didn't have a significant impact to the average ticket. So overall, we're really pleased with how it performed, obviously, driven by the extended spring. But overall, it was very consistent with the overall performance of the company.", "Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "So just to clarify, an extended spring selling season, is that -- would that typically benefit or hurt big-ticket sales?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "In this case, it would benefit because some of the categories, in particular, riding lawnmowers, was very strong during the August -- July and August period. However, it was offset by some of the emergency response that we experienced last year related to Hurricane Isaac and as well as there was some Mid-Atlantic power outages in the early part of the quarter. Also, we talked a little bit about the end of September as we look -- as we await cold weather. A lot of times, we may have some cold weather product merchandise, chainsaws, heating, et cetera, that we sell at the end of the quarter and we did not have those sales. So it was a little bit of a mixed bag, but generally driven by the power equipment storage category and strong sales in trailers.", "Operator", "We'll go now to Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Tony, on the CapEx reduction for this year, of the range, I'm not sure I heard you correctly. Was it that the costs are coming in less than you had anticipated or they're just coming later so they're going to hit next year?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "I'd love to tell you that they're coming in less, but we are right on plan. It's just really the staging of the payments itself based -- when we look out throughout the rest of the year, they're going to probably trail what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year, and that's principally related to the new Store Support Center. As we roll into next year, I am still going to vigorously try to maintain our $250 million target. There may be a few additional projects that will drive that number up a little bit, but I'm going to try to maintain the CapEx in that range to try to keep some consistency from year-to-year.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then the expenses in the P&L that were related to some of this activity, the relocations and whatnot. I think you said it was going to be $0.01 in the fourth quarter. So does that total like $9.5 million this year? I think that was a little higher than what you guys had thought at the beginning of the year. First, are my numbers correct? And then secondly, what were -- why were the costs higher?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Generally, it was about where we had anticipated. And I, unfortunately, get a little confused as we did the stock split. But we had said originally, I want to say 5 to 7, so that takes me to about 3.5 on the high end. We definitely came in at around the high end when you add up all the quarters.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Right, okay. And then last question maybe, Greg, can you talk about some of the operational initiatives that you guys have underway? I'm thinking specifically things around systems. I know you have a new demand forecasting tool that you guys lined up, labor management and then also the supply chain, the mixing centers. Just maybe you can give us a sense of kind of the timing of those coming out and what type of benefits you're expecting.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "All right. Well, Peter, we'll start in reverse. We'll talk mixing centers, still operating out of Waco. Test has proven itself. We are looking for sites currently. And I believe we'll have a site located hopefully about the first -- or end of this year and start to really get this thing operational. As far as other initiatives, demand planning, we are currently working now with SaaS, and we will start to roll into that new format next year. And it will take about 18 months to roll it completely out and have it through the entire company, touching all of the parts of the merchandising group that it needs to. As far as other things in the supply chain, we're spending a lot of time there trying to understand what labor management can mean. We do have it up and running in one of our buildings. We are liking what we are seeing initially with the reporting and our ability to be able to interact with the team members out there and give them goals and objectives as they're doing their picking and sortings and building of pallets and such within the mix of the goods that are coming to the building. We also have another new component in that Macon facility, the import center. And really what that's being used for is to stage a lot of the bulk inventory that comes in from the Far East and stage it in that building and not have to pre-distribute. We can do it post. So we can start looking at keeping that bulk there, pushing minimal quantities to the stores initially. And then as the demand of sales are generated, we'll then start to push that bulk in that building out to those distribution centers based upon the needs of those stores. And that's very unique. It is something that we've been talking to for a while. We now have it in process. So far, so good as far as what we're seeing from that, but there's a lot of learnings there, a lot of learnings.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Sure, that makes sense. Can that import center be helpful to the fourth quarter? Or is that something more next year?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "It's going to be more next year as we start turning the corner into the spring.", "Operator", "And we'll go now to Joan Storms with Wedbush.", "Joan L. Bogucki-Storms - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "I just had a follow-up question on CapEx. And Tony, I think you had talked about the timing for the new DC out west, and how is that CapEx number going to look? You delayed a little bit into 2014. If you can comment on that at all and maybe into 2015.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "As far as 2014 goes, we anticipate in 2015 to have a Southwest distribution center. We would expect to incur some costs next year most likely with either the acquisition of land, but we do not plan to have significant expenditures around that. It could range to maybe $4 million to $5 million. So I don't see that as any type of deviation from our 5-year forecast on CapEx. When it comes to the Store Support Center, as much of some of the payments are lagging our forecast, we still maintain being on budget. And as we move into 2014, again, I've targeted $250 million of CapEx in our long-term forecast, and I'd like to try to stay within that guard rail.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I want to go back to gross margin, which I know has gotten some air time already today. Just want to think about whether this represents a breakout quarter in a sustainable basis. For 5 out of the past 7 quarters, your gross margin was flat to down. And I know that there are some idiosyncratic reasons, weather-related and natural disasters, et cetera that contributed to that. That being said, a lot of the underlying drivers that kicked in here were in place then, whether it be imports and exclusives, et cetera. Is there a step function or tipping point of some sort for any of these initiatives that you think got traction here in Q3 that you think continues to produce at a faster rate than we might have seen over the past several quarters as we look forward?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Matt, I'll speak to it, and I know Tony has got some comments. We have said all along that we thought the third and fourth quarter this year, we would see some improvement in margin rate. We knew that there was some deflation coming into play. We also knew that our mix of exclusive brand products and our import -- the strategic import programs we're going to start to ramp as we go into this fall. So that's a direct margin push, good guys. So we knew there were some factors coming into this that made us feel more comfortable that we had some running room here on rate. And we believe that is sustainable. Now you still got headwinds. You still got headwinds with some of -- freight. You've still got headwinds with a mix with C.U.E., but the headwinds were a little eased this quarter in comparison to earlier quarters of the year.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "I would echo Greg's comments and just say that having the later spring, we had good positive margins from some of our spring categories that we may not normally see in the July, August time frame. And so that was a driver. And again, as I mentioned earlier, when it comes to clearing out of seasons, that can have an impact on a particular quarter and it will vary from quarter-to-quarter how we exit seasons. So again we're very successful on how we managed through the spring exit and that obviously has a positive impact on the margins.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "What was the year-to-date increase, if you would? I know you typically have this quarter, but quarter-to-quarter if you have it, the year-to-date increase in exclusives and imports, just so we could compare the third quarter run rate.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes. I have to get you the exact number. I thought that we were up approximately on a full year basis -- on a quarter basis we were up almost a full percentage point, but I don't have the year -- the full year number.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "One thing, Matt, what we can tell you is Q3 of 2012 to Q3 of 2013, there was about a full 3 points worth of movement, 27.5% to probably over 30% to 31%, so nice movement.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And so that seems like the breakout element of this potentially. The second question, just to make sure that we frame the $0.04 to $0.05 headwind that you talked about on SG&A from various factors next year against the extra items that you might have booked this year, because we know there are some of those, what will that -- sort of the exogenous items end up being, you think, for 2013 when all is said and done?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Well, when we talk about the data center and the distribution center relocations, they clearly were the largest drivers, and they would be onetime events. As we move into 2014, the move of the Store Support Center would be a one-time event. Obviously, as we start to move to 2014, we can make a better assessment as to the impact of the Affordable Care Act, as well as getting a feel for the impact on freight when it comes to our supply chain in the West stores. So it is a little bit different than on a year-over-year basis as these discrete items in 2013 are a onetime charge, whereas next year they may be more embedded in the run rate.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. So if we're to isolate -- if we're to take out health care and take out freight, which both of those I know are big and potentially recurring, you're saying the $0.04 to $0.05 number, I still think was a number for next year, correct? Or are all those factors in there?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "All the 3 factors that I mentioned constitute the $0.04 to $0.05. And again, I'm just trying to give you an overall perspective early on so that it doesn't come as any surprise when we have our more detailed call, fourth quarter call.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And just to finish up, the discrete onetime items that you booked this year related to headquarters consolidation, things like that, that I know have weighed on your numbers certainly this quarter and, I guess, will in the fourth quarter a little bit, where will that aggregate for the year?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "It looks like it's around about $0.04.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. So it sounds like in essence, the extra charges, I mean, they'll be there, but they might not change the expense run rate because you have some items that you'll cycle off?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Correct.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "First, a technical question. You talk about bulk imports that you'll be staging. Could you give us a few examples of what types of products those might be?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes. When you look at spring, as an example, it could be lawn carts. It could be, let me think, wheelbarrows, things of that nature, things that you would be bringing in, in bulk because you're importing them. And instead of trying to push those out to every store in a pre-distribution process using last year's sales as history, we would rather see that inventory sitting in one large location. And as the sales start to develop in the season, then you start to push that inventory out to those DCs that feed the stores in those regions. So it's a more precise way of allocating inventory to sales. That's the advantage.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. I understood the concept. I was thinking in terms of like bulk feeder, that kind of thing, I see what you mean.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "No, no. That's perishable. This would be hardlines-type product, yes.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Got you, got you. Turning to your business, you're a retailer that covers a very wide demographic, and we still have this bifurcated economic recovery. How are you able to reach out and cultivate customers that are able to spend more and purchase more of those big-ticket items. Are you actively doing that in any way?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, first of all, I would probably challenge you on a -- this wide customer base you're talking about. We really are pretty narrow in the customer we try to target. These people that live outside the cities, that live in this lifestyle, it's a pretty narrowed group. However, the store itself does appeal and can appeal to many other segments. Now getting to the piece about how do we cultivate customers and how we're selling big-ticket, our customers typically buy out of need. So when you think about that, you say, if they buy a piece of outdoor power equipment and they've spent good money on that, let's say, they've spent $3,000 or $4,000, they will take care of that piece of equipment for a period of time. And what we saw back in the early part of the recession was instead of replacing, they were repairing and extending life. Now we may have seen in the second half of this summer, the extended season here, a little bit of the fact that some of those units couldn't extend the life and so they had to replace them. And I'm not telling you that we're in that cycle. But clearly, that extended season gave us some opportunity to sell some more units, and it's possible some of those units couldn't -- the life couldn't be extended. But we talk to our customers very specifically through the Internet, through direct mail, through our marketing process that talks to them more directly. It's not broad based. It's very targeted. And we have a very targeted base of -- in our databases here in the marketing department. So I would tell you that we know them probably better than many of the people we compete with. We know many of their buying patterns and their needs. We need to learn more, but we play off of that and we send them offers and we talk to them directly about the things that they're interested in. And I think that's probably one of the unique things about us with our customer base.", "Operator", "We'll go now to Jeff Black with Avondale Partners.", "Jeff Black - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "And just a quick question. Are C.U.E. margins improving in any like-for-like area? And do we just expect headwinds to abate? Or are the 4 strategies you're using in the rest of the segments -- do they have an opportunity to, over time, improve C.U.E. margins?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes. Definitely, when it comes to the C.U.E. items, we would expect that they will moderate slightly as they become a larger piece of the base. So the deviation from that, I'd say, base or norm will become less and will be less impactful. We have seen some improvement in certain categories, but you have to remember that the C.U.E. items really expand all 5 of the major categories, and there are so many different SKUs that you're going to have various mix from quarter-to-quarter. So I don't think you can really look at it and say, \"Okay, C.U.E. items, the margins have improved and that's what's driving the moderation.\" I think you have a combination of things, as we've talked about. As we move into a deflationary period, gross margin percent improves, so you have that. You have some improved margins as we move into some of the newer stores. So there's a lot of different variables as well as the price optimization and improvement in prices. Now that, obviously, would be sustainable as far the improvement in the C.U.E. margins. So a lot of different variables. And again, it's our responsibility to manage those.", "Operator", "We'll go now to Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "One quick question on gross margins again. So I guess, historically, when we look back over how you guys perform, especially in a seasonal quarter, there is sometimes bifurcation between how comps go and how gross margins go. Typically, when you're comping better, it's a lot of OPE, and that has a drag on margins. Or in the case like this quarter, you had very strong traffic, a lot of it is often C.U.E.-related. Again, a drag on margins. But gross margins were much better than expected. I mean, clearly, you had some onetime things going on here. But I mean, are you starting to see -- and one thing, I guess, I wanted to build out on this, you did call out a little bit less drag from transportation and mix. Looking forward, especially as you backfill the Northeast, which is a lot more dense, do you think there's any point in time where you cross the threshold and you start to, not necessarily leverage, but sort of flatten out the negative impact from mix and transportation?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Wow. Adam, that was about 10 questions in one, I think, that you just asked us. Let's start maybe talking a little bit about the gross margin in general and the components of it. Typically, when we have inflation, okay, we see comps moving up and sometimes pressure on margin. Vice versa, when we have deflation, we see sometimes some pressure on comp sales, but we see margin rate moving. What you're seeing right now in our business is a different blend again and the blends will be changing as the company evolves. C.U.E. has become more important. Not all of C.U.E. is low, low, low margins, but a lot of that high-velocity, high-volume stuff that is low in value is lower in margin. So as that mix would grow, and as Tony said, it looks like it's going to start to moderate because there's other parts of the store that Steve and the team are driving sales behind, it makes the blend a little different than it was in second quarter and it'll probably be a little different again in fourth quarter. And you say, \"Well, why do you say that?\" Well, in fourth quarter, I've got a lot of high margin, I'll call it, gift-type products sitting in the store that if it translates and I sell more of that at the higher margin rate, I take that to the bottom line, that takes some of the pressure off to the mix of the margin again. So because of the kind of store we are -- we're not just an apparel store. We're not just a feed store. We're not just a tools store. We're not just an outdoor power equipment store. All these mixtures of things, it is our responsibility as the manager of this company to look at these constantly, look at the balances, make sure that when we're planning our marketing, our advertising, our presentations in the stores, where we plan to drive our business, we understand those triggers and those levers. And it is -- it's not easy. And I would tell you that the operators in the store side, in Lee's group and Steve's group on the merchandise side, they're talking constantly about mix. They're talking constantly about the constitution of our average sale in the store, what is it looking like today versus 3 months, versus a year ago? So this threshold you're talking about is at some point when you get to a certain level of velocity, do things start to level out and do costs kind of stabilize? I think as we work this process of understanding, using maybe the mixing-center concept as a variable, we can start taking cost out of high-velocity, high-volume, low-value product. That's going to be a big plus for us. But I can't tell you that we've got all of that figured out yet, but that's a component of C.U.E. that we're working on. And I have confidence we will find the answer at some point, and that will help us start to level some of these fluctuations. But I will tell you that weather plays a role, a consumer confidence will play a role, timing of events and such play a role. So there's so many variables here, Adam, that it's not an easy conversation to have, to be honest.", "Operator", "We will go now to Simeon Gutman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I'll ask 2 questions, and I'll put them up front because I realized it's running late. First, Tony to close out on the SG&A piece, and I'll keep it high-level because I'm sure you didn't want to speak about it this much. Maybe encapsulating some of what Matt was asking earlier, if you look at onetime stuff and then onetime stuff year-versus-year, is there any reason to believe that the threshold in which the business gets expense leverage, should that be any different next year?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "If I look year-over-year, I don't believe that it would be too different. I would say, I'm expecting it to be similar.", "Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then second of all, just honing in on September. Some retailers out there look like they had some type of abrupt slowdown in business, and I know you called out September being a little bit slower in terms of the month, but it was seasonal. How do you, I guess, disaggregate -- and I'm sure you've seen a lot of the data -- disaggregate some of the seasonal from a customer that, in disguise, might have been getting a little weaker?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Again, it is very difficult to try to differentiate between the 2. However, being with the business for as long as we have, when we look at the customer, we look at core categories, we see how they're spending their dollars, we could tell that the driver, principally in the back half of September, really was more the cold-weather products. And so that gave us comfort that it wasn't necessarily the customer, but it was more of a seasonal issue as we transition into fall/winter.", "Operator", "We'll go to our final question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Joseph I. Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "I wanted to just go back to the transactions count being -- consistently being up, and was wondering are you guys seeing anything different? You mentioned that you're seeing a lot of the same customers shop. So I'm wondering, are you just seeing people trying to stretch their paychecks by shopping more frequently, but spending a little less each time? Or I guess, how should we think about that, and maybe where the state of the economy is right now in your markets?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Joe, this is Greg. I would tell you first that the transaction values are very similar to what they were in prior quarters. So we're not seeing them spending really more or less. I think what we truly are seeing is, as Tony mentioned earlier, 2 things: One, current consumer base giving us more of their wallet. They're buying more things with us. Remember, we talked earlier about how we take a customer who's maybe buying in the equine area and we start to talk to them through our marketing vehicles and our capture of information about other pets that they may have and other products they may want to entertain buying from us because we know that horse or equine customers have other pets. And we're starting to see some of that movement. We can track that. The second thing is, clearly, it's a market share game, and we're seeing market share growing. We're being told that by the industries that we do business in, and that's many new customers for the most part.", "Joseph I. Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Got you. And do you think the market share is coming from -- you've always talked about kind of going into smaller areas and taking out some mom-and-pops? Or do you -- are you seeing it maybe from the other big-box players that are out there?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Really hard to say where it's coming from. I would tell you that I think it's customers are finding us to be a better solution for them. Maybe it's an easier shop for them, it's a more convenient shop for them, it's a one-stop shop. We talk about that all the time. I honestly believe that's what it is. And as we look at the basket of the sale, we're starting to see that there's more things going into that basket from some of those current consumers that we do track.", "Operator", "And with no further questions, this will conclude our conference. Thank you, all, for your participation.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Okay. In closing, I'd like to thank all of those who are invested in Tractor Supply, and I'd like to personally thank and recognize all of our hard-working team members who serve our customers each and every business day. As many of you have heard me say before and comment, retail is really all about people. And I recently had the opportunity to visit a number of our new Western store locations, and I continue to be impressed with the quality of our team members that are serving our customers out there. Our field management continues to place great emphasis on hiring hard-working, knowledgeable team members with winning attitudes.", "Tractor Supply is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year and was founded on a core set of values that remain our company's guiding principles today. I am proud to be -- to play a role here and to be part of this organization, and I remain very excited about the many opportunities that lie ahead of us.

Greg, please go ahead.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you, Randy. And good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for your continued interest in Tractor Supply, and for being on our call this afternoon. With me today are Tony Crudele, our CFO; Steve Barbarick, our EVP of Merchandising and Marketing; and Lee Downing, our Senior Vice President of Store Operations. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.", "We are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results and are proud of our many achievements in 2013. The fourth quarter marked the 17th consecutive quarter of positive comp store sales and our 23rd consecutive quarter of positive comp transaction counts. Both our stores and our cross functional support teams at the store support center and the distribution centers continued to execute effectively on our company's initiatives. Our customer satisfaction scores continued to be solid as all of our TSE team members strive to take better care of our customers through meeting their specific-product needs and providing them with a legendary customer service.", "In addition to delivering record results in 2013, we accomplished several other milestones in our business. Tractor Supply entered 3 new states; opening our first store in Arizona, Nevada and Wyoming. We now operate in 48 states and continue to expand our presence in the West. We opened a new relocated distribution center in Macon, Georgia that also houses our first direct import center. We broke ground on our new Store Support Center located just down the block from our existing offices that will consolidate all of our Store Support Center teams back together under one roof. We celebrated the company's 75th-year anniversary by ringing in the NASDAQ opening bell in October. And lastly, Tractor Supply was added to the NASDAQ 100 Index in late December and to the coveted S&P 500 Index at the close of trading last Saturday -- excuse me, last Thursday.", "We've come along way in 75 years, but our mission and values remain unchanged. We are driven to be the most dependable supplier of basic maintenance needs to recreational farmers, ranchers and rural consumers. We are continuing to invest and to build a business capable of delivering long-term sustainable growth, and we are committed to achieving our long-term goal growth targets through a balanced approach to managing sales margin, expenses and our capital. We are building our infrastructure with tools and technology to further our ability to offer our customers the right products, at the right time, at the right location and at the right price, no matter if they shop with us in-store or online. We have made great progress over the last several years and believe this is reflected in our earnings growth. We also believe there continues to be a tremendous opportunity ahead to grow our overall business while we invest in the long-term sustainability of our model in the following tiers, those being: merchandising, demand planning and logistics, multichannel retail and customer relationship management. Now let me briefly touch on these areas and provide you with how and where we are investing for long-term sustainable growth.", "In merchandising, we are constantly evolving our offerings to meet the changing needs of our customers. Our stores average about 15,500 square feet. So it's very important to utilize the 4-wall space effectively. Our customers want a shopping experience where they can get in and out of our stores quickly, and we want them to be confident that we will have the products they are looking for. We know this dependability of always being in-stock is driving sustainable repeat traffic into our stores. In the supply chain, we are investing in tools to help us better plan our assortments and manage our in-stock levels, both at the macro and more importantly, the local level. For example, based on feedback received from our store teams this past year, we made a strategic decision to continue with several spring and summer planograms throughout many of our southern markets. We also refined our assortment of heating products this fall, adding new market-specific products, while revising our price points to address changing market conditions. In both instances, our customers responded positively.", "Our strategic focus continued in multichannel throughout 2013 and those investments generated a measurable increase in business for the second half. We believe holiday and other seasonal events throughout the year will continue to provide opportunity for both our stores and our multichannel business as we expand our functionality online. Our plan is to continue our strategy of taking a longer term, well-thought through approach, adding platform capabilities based upon a more thorough understanding of our customers' expectations and preferences as they interact with the site.", "On the customer relationship management side of our business, we are investing in multiple areas to more clearly identify and reach our existing and potential new customer base. We believe there is tremendous long-term opportunity here, and we are progressing thoughtfully with the development of a customer affinity program. We have made improvements in our CRM capability and our customer attribution rates have nearly doubled in the past few years, but there is still a lot more to learn and to do.", "Now before I turn the call over to Tony, I want to recognize all of our hard-working team members that serve our customers every day and who have delivered the results we will be reviewing with you today. I am proud of them, and proud to be part of this organization that was founded 75 years ago with one focus: taking care of the customer. And just as important, our company mission and values, on which we operate daily, is the foundation that remains as strong and an integral part of the unique culture we embrace here at Tractor Supply as it was back then. I believe our future is bright and I'm extremely excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.", "I will now turn the call over to Tony for his review of the fourth quarter financials and our forward outlook. Tony?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Thanks, Greg. And good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended December 28, 2013, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 10% to $1.42 billion and net income grew 20.6% to $95.9 million or $0.68 per diluted share. Comp store sales increased 3.5% in the fourth quarter compared to an increase of 4.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Comp transaction count increased for the 23rd consecutive quarter, gaining 5.1% on top of a 2.7% increase last year. We are very pleased with our ability to continue driving increased foot traffic through our doors by meeting the everyday needs of our customers.", "C.U.E. items and strong winter seasonal business were the key traffic drivers in the quarter. Average comp ticket decreased by 1.5% versus last year's 1.8%. The decrease resulted primarily from deflation and reduction in big-ticket sales as we cycled Hurricane Sandy in the earlier part of the quarter.", "A few key points about the quarter. Comp sales were in line with our expectations. As we had discussed on our last conference call, we anticipated that the prospect of deflation could dampen comp sales for Q4. We anticipated deflation to be relatively flat, but instead we estimate it was 85 basis points in the quarter. Strong sales of, and the mix in, our feed-related products led to the variance in expectations. Big-ticket also had a negative impact on comp sales by an estimated 126 basis points as we cycled emergency response sales last year from Hurricane Sandy.", "On a regional basis, comp sales were solid across all regions with the exception of the Northeast region. Again, this resulted from the cycling of Hurricane Sandy. Sales of direct import items increased 40% versus Q4 last year and represented 15.8% [ph] of the sales mix in the quarter. Sales of exclusive branded products were also very strong in the quarter and increased 19% year-over-year, and represented approximately 30% of total sales.", "Turning to gross margin, which increased 90 basis points, to 33.9%. Our initial direct margin continues to improve as a result of the initiatives around price management, markdown management and strategic sourcing. The favorable colder weather provided strong sell-through of our seasonal winter products resulting in fewer markdowns.", "As we cycled the higher grain prices last year, experienced deflation and maintained our gross margin per unit sold, our gross margin percentage benefited, which we estimated to be about 13 basis points. Additionally, we had a slightly favorable mix variance this quarter as we cycled the emergency response sales of Hurricane Sandy last year. Margin was favorably impacted by a higher number of new stores opened in the back half of the year compared to 2012. Freight as a percent of sales was essentially flat compared to the prior year.", "For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 22.5% of sales compared to 23.3% in the prior year's quarter. The deleverage in SG&A was caused by several factors, which include we incurred higher cold weather-related costs, including electric, gas, snow removal and floor care.", "As discussed on our previous conference calls, during our data center relocation, we incurred additional rent while we maintained 2 facilities and depreciation increased as we placed new equipment into service. Also as discussed, we had the increased expense of our relocated Southeast distribution center, which is included in SG&A. We continued to refresh and maintain our store fleet with particular focus as we went into the holiday season. The depreciation increased as we put into service during the year, e-commerce assets, which are part of our replatforming and our other multichannel initiatives.", "Our effective income tax rate decreased 35% in Q4 compared to 36.2% last year. The decrease was due principally to the reversal of certain FIN 48 reserves.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with $142.7 million in cash compared to $138.6 million last year and within our targeted range. During the fourth quarter under our stock repurchase program, we acquired approximately 535,000 shares for $38.8 million. We estimate that the share repurchase program did not have a material impact on EPS for the quarter. Average inventory levels per store at year end decreased 50 basis points compared to last year as a result of the strong sell-through of seasonal merchandise.", "Inventory trends for the year improved slightly, up 1 basis point to 3.29x. We are pleased with the productivity of our inventory during the quarter and the year, and we ended the quarter in great shape, well-positioned to exit the winter season in Q1.", "Capital expenditures for the year were $218 million as compared to $153 million last year. We opened 31 stores in the fourth quarter compared to 25 stores in fourth quarter of 2012. For the year, we opened 102 stores. The year-over-year increase in CapEx relates principally to the construction of the Southeast distribution center placed in service last summer and our Store Support Center, which will be opened in the second half of this year. This increase in capital is consistent with our longer-term capital plan as we estimate spending $250 million each of the next several years.", "Turning our attention to 2014. We expect full year sales to range from $5.62 billion to $5.7 billion. We have forecasted comp sales to increase between 2.5% and 4%. We're targeting improvement of approximately 20 to 30 basis points in EBIT margin compared to 2013 coming principally from gross margin as a result of several of the key merchandise initiatives. We expect SG&A percent to be generally flat as I'll detail later. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $360 million to $370 million or $2.54 to $2.62 per diluted share. And we expect to open 102 to 106 new stores with approximately 50% to 55% scheduled to open in the first half of the year. We forecast that our effective tax rate will be approximately 37%, a significant increase from the 36.2% rate in 2013.", "Last year, we had the reinstatement of the WOTC credits in the first quarter, but the program expired at the end of 2013 and was not reinstated for 2014. We also had the release of FIN 48 reserves in the fourth quarter that we do not anticipate having in the same magnitude for 2014. We expect capital expenditures in 2014 to range between approximately $240 million to $250 million. The increase over last year results from the completion of the construction of the Store Support Center this year. And initial development of the Southwest distribution center. We continue to invest in our store fleet and have increased our store growth and maintenance budget by $20 million. We will continue to make purchases under the share repurchase program as part of our long-term objective of reducing cost of capital and maintaining a targeted cash balance of $100 million to $150 million.", "For modeling purposes, we estimate that diluted shares outstanding inclusive of option grant and share repurchase activity will approximate 141.6 million for the full year.", "So let me discuss some of the more specific drivers and assumptions that helped us form our projections for 2014. We do not expect that the current retail environment will change dramatically as consumers continue to focus on everyday basic needs with limited spending on discretionary items. There were some positive and negative weather events that impacted the timing of sales in 2013. This has included a late spring and extended spring-summer into the third quarter and a cold December. We believe it was a net neutral year from a weather perspective. Therefore, we do not anticipate that cycling against last year's weather trends will have a significant impact on the full year-over-year results, but as we've emphasized in the past, we believe our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on halves, not the quarters as weather patterns will change from year-to-year, and shift the timing of the sales between quarters.", "This year, we expect that we will have a deflationary impact ranging from flat to 1% for the year. And that will be at the higher end of that range in the first half of the year and slightly less in the second half of the year. This will obviously be a headwind to comp sales as this could be up to 170 basis points swing year-over-year.", "As I commented earlier, we expect gross margin rate to be the principal driver of EBIT margin expansion. We expect to achieve our gross margin rate improvement through the execution of the key gross margin initiatives, continued strong markdown and inventory management, gross margin rate tailwind provided by a deflationary environment. We believe these factors will provide us the ability to overcome an estimated gross margin rate headwind of approximately 10 to 15 basis points from the continuing mix shift to our C.U.E. products, which carry a below-chain average margin rate and additional freight. This headwind is less than in prior years. We also will have a headwind from the increased stem miles as we continue to open new stores in the West.", "In terms of cadence, we expect gross margin percent improvement to be greater in the first half of the year as we will benefit the most from the deflation impact. We believe that the third and fourth quarters will have the toughest comparisons as we cycle the very strong gross margin improvement and very favorable clearance conditions in the prior year. We expect the fourth quarter to decline in gross margin rate based on our modeling. Inventory turns are expected to improve slightly, we would expect per store inventory to increase modestly consistent with investments in key merchandising categories.", "With respect to SG&A, we did not expect to leverage SG&A this year and anticipate SG&A will be flat even at the high end of our comp guidance. As Greg discussed, we will continue to invest in our business and infrastructure with long-term perspective and as we do so, some of the expected benefits may come in future periods. For example, we continue to invest in our multichannel platform, we will continue to test our mixing center logistics approach, we will continue to pilot stewardship programs such as energy-efficient systems, lighting and solar; and we will embark on new initiatives such as demand planning and clearance price optimization.", "In addition to driving key initiatives, I had mentioned on our Q3 conference call, we had several items that will impact SG&A as we grow the business this year. I have previously discussed that, we will be transitioning later this year to our new corporate store support center, we will be consolidating 3 leased facilities and we'll incur lease write-off and various transition costs in the second half the year. We believe that this will provide us reduced occupancy costs in the future years compared to a lease scenario. As the Affordable Care Act rolls out, we forecast the medical expense will increase as a result of increased enrollment, along with various charges that are embedded in the Act. In addition to those 2 items that I had previously mentioned, as we continue to expand our Northeast footprint, we anticipate expanding our D.C. capacity in Northeast, and we are currently evaluating leasing additional space in the Northeast in the back half of 2014.", "In conjunction with our store support center move, we will be relocating our planogram facility to a nearby location to better assist our buying teams to visualize merchandise resets. And finally, we continue to refresh our store fleet as leases renew to maintain a good customer experience. We estimate that these items that I've mentioned represent a drag on EPS of approximately $0.05 to $0.06. As you know last year, we had approximately $0.03 in nonrecurring charges for our distribution and data center relocations, so we expect a net impact of about $0.02 to $0.03 on the P&L.", "Some key points with respect to the quarters. I remember that last year, we had a late spring and we are hopeful that we'll have an earlier spring, but currently, we anticipate it being warm in March only in the South region. Although the first quarter has gotten off to a good start with the cold weather, let me remind you that March is the most impactful month in the quarter and is very dependent on spring weather. Also with the advent of the colder January-February weather, we will have additional store expenses related to cold weather store maintenance in the first quarter.", "Also, we have an extended spring/summer selling season which benefited Q3 last year. We believe that this will be the toughest quarter from a sales comparison standpoint. With respect to SG&A items I mentioned earlier, although the larger portion of the expenses are allocated to the third and fourth quarters, the impact is limited since we cycle the greater portion of the nonrecurring D.C. and data center relocation last year in those quarters as well. For modeling purposes, it maybe simplest to just allocate ratably during the year. As in the past, we will provide more color regarding our expectations for the subsequent periods at each quarterly conference call. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now turn to the operator -- we will now turn -- open for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today, RBC Capital Markets, Scot Ciccarelli.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Can you address any other -- you talked about kind of the cadence for gross margin. While you guys have had kind of the multiple initiative to drive gross margin, is there anything else we should be considering? And do you view the numbers you threw out as kind of realistic or conservative or aggressive? Just kind of the mindset around that.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Scot, when it comes to the margin, again, what I've laid out in the prepared remarks, I think represents looking at the quarters and really trying to dissect them and understand what transpired in 2013. And remember, as much as the initiatives -- really on an ongoing basis will improve our margin, hopefully, year after year, there are many things that impacted margin during the course of a particular quarter. And obviously, the clearance effort is one of those. So as we analyze that throughout the year, we think that the guidance that we provided is very reasonable relative to the sort of a quarter-over-quarter performance that we expect through 2014. As it comes to guidance, again, we take a very diligent approach to putting together our models. And we believe that our guidance is very consistent in -- to the extent in which we've done it in the past years.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from John Lawrence, Stephens.", "John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Just quickly, Greg, if you look at the fourth quarter, congratulations on the traffic. What do you think -- I mean, the cold weather, as you look at those baskets, do you think that's new customers? Customer spending more, cold weather have something to do with that or how would you sort of break that down?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "John, Greg. This is a great -- It's a great question. And as we track our customer counts in stores, we would have to tell you that there's got to be some new customer acquisition happening because we look at our units that we sell in some of these C.U.E categories and some of these commodity categories. And year-over-year, by having the types of increases we're seeing, it leads us to believe that there's considerable movement with new customers coming through the front doors. I'll also tell you, though, that as you know our customer base, when it gets cold outside, they respond and they typically do a bit of pantry-filling on certain products because the fear of the cold weather and so on. So it's a combination of both.", "John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Great. And could you give us maybe just one deeper dive into what did you learn about the multichannel business, maybe now it's just -- we really had 6 months really going?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, we learned several things. One is that there is considerable opportunity over the longer period of time for our customers. They like to go online and they like to research. And they typically come into the store to make the purchase. The second thing I'll tell you is that we got a lot of work to do in that space. We are still in the early stages of a lot of the platform initiatives that are going to make it a much friendlier site to shop and a more full site as far as selections and that to [ph] shop. So I can tell you initial learnings are that there is potential. Initial learnings that our customers are receptive to it. Initial learnings are that we've still got a lot more work to do, and we'll speak more to that as we get into 2014.", "Operator", "Up next from Robert Baird is Peter Benedict.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "A couple of questions. First, just -- can you maybe, Greg, speak to the cadence of sales during the fourth quarter? I mean, you guys don't give too much detail there, but as you know, everybody is incredibly nervous around retail right now and these numbers look particularly good, particularly the traffic numbers. So just -- can you give us a flavor of how the quarter went and you said the first quarter is off to a good start. Would that be something that's similar to what you saw across the fourth quarter? Or just anymore color would be very helpful.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Peter, this is Tony. Just a quick snapshot, you can imagine the weather was not as beneficial in October, so that was one of your slower months. When you look at the quarter for us this year, the DAT, day after Thanksgiving shifted into December. So that really distorts those numbers. When I normalize those 2 months, still December comes out as being the strongest performing month in the quarter. So what we see was a real nice trend and we like the trend that continued on into January.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then, I guess a bigger question. On the traffic, is there a point at which you guys start to get concerned about your ability to continue to drive increased trips? I mean, it's obviously been a great run here. I don't know maybe, Steve, if you could speak to some of the merchandising opportunities you see. I mean it's a great run, but how long do you think you can continue doing it?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Peter, this is Steve. I would tell you that we've got a great track record, of 23 straight quarters of continued comp transaction growth. The initiatives that we have out there around new products, C.U.E. items, things we do with localization. I think we're just continuing to get ongoing traffic. I think as we become national, word-of-mouth gets out. And we've been doing a really nice job bringing new customers in. We're really a one-stop shop for our customer in the lifestyle. So we anticipate continued growth.", "Operator", "Next up from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey is David Magee.", "David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I guess on a related question, with regard to 2014, what would you consider to be some major merchandise initiatives? In the past couple of years, we've seen [indiscernible] roll out a lot of plans [ph], what do you see for 2014?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes, this is Steve again. I mean, we've got 4 major buckets when it comes to driving sales in our stores. And we've got a pretty full test program that we've got a number of categories that we're rolling out right now. We work at them, we test them and we roll. And I would tell you that, that bucket is full. We've got some great learning in '13 that we'll apply to '14. We'll continue to support our C.U.E business. And I will tell you that we'll do more investment when it comes to inventory into those categories. We're going to expand assortments. We're going to be priced right locally, and there's a number of key initiatives that we've got going on within C.U.E. We're still at the forefront of localization, and I believe we've got a lot more upside on opportunity there. You heard Greg talking about some of what we did with our planograms down south, leaving them on year-round. You heard a little bit about what we've done with heating. And just one other quick example is when we looked at our cat litter business, we know there are pockets of the country that do incredibly well with it, and we are expanding our assortments in key geographical areas. So I don't want to get too specific here, but I would tell you that we've got a lot of confidence in what we're doing going forward.", "David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Are you seeing any difference in your customers' behavior with regard to, say, middle-to-upper income versus those that might be a little bit lower income? Are you seeing the latter be more fatigued at this point in time?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "No. No, we're not, Dave. As a matter of fact, [indiscernible] seem to be very similar pattern-wise from what they were earlier in the year.", "Operator", "Michael Lasser from UBS is up next.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "The SG&A margin is going to be flat this year, flattish after leveraging 25 basis points last year. That's been coming down for the last few years. Do you feel like you're having to invest more in the infrastructure and the sophistication of the business in order to drive similar comp outcome or traffic outcome? And should we expect that to continue to be the case or at some point, will you be able to harvest these investments?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Mike, let me take a shot at that. This is Greg. I would tell you that we talk about longer-term investment because as the business grows, it's changing. And the demands are different from 700 stores to 1,000 stores to 1,500 stores and such. And you have to be more precise. You have to have the information to make good decisions. So we're putting in the systems that allow us to gain that scale and then hopefully, over time, that efficiency in the payback comes. We believe it will. So yes, as you grow larger, the demands on your sophistication and levels that you have to operate by, from a granularity standpoint, do change. So I would say, that's some of the drag, yes.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And Greg, are you hearing anything from your stores -- rumblings about potentially being nervous on the health of your consumer, given what has happened with grain prices and the commodity infrastructure?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Not at all. As a matter of fact -- again, as I said, we track our units very closely in all of our categories. And as we continue to see units rising, even through the deflationary periods, gives us great confidence that we're taking market share. So no, not at all.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And the last follow-up question is for Tony. In the third quarter, you outlined $0.04 to $0.05 of investment spending. I think you bumped it up by a $0.01. What was the cause of the increase?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Well, as we noted in the Q3 conference call, one of the items I had mentioned was the stem mile increase as we move out West. That was a gross margin impact item. So I had carved that out. And then in addition, the 2 to 3 other items that I mentioned in the prepared remarks added to that number. So that's how we got up to the $0.05 to $0.06.", "Operator", "From Goldman Sachs, Matthew Fassler is next.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "The first question I'd like to ask relates to your commerce business. As you're getting a sense of customers' tastes and demands online, are you finding that they're sort of accepting some logistical limitations on some of the categories you cover? In other words, are they looking for you to do things that make economic sense? Or do you find that they're looking up more seriously on some of the categories that are tougher logistics?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Matt, this is Greg. First of all, our customers are buying across the store online, that includes some big ticket items as well as items that can be either drop-shipped from the vendor or shipped from our distribution point in Franklin, Kentucky, UPS. So there's no preference either way. It's a good mix. They also were very willing and they understand that it costs money to ship something to them, so whether it's an LTL charge or it's a UPS charge, they seems to be a very willing to absorb that.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's great to hear. And then the second question I have relates to just sort of an annual gut check on what you continue to learn as you grow the business out west. Obviously, that's some of your newer markets, I know the initial efforts have been successful sort of as you close out this year and then through the next one. Any particularly critical learnings about a -- the differences in doing businesses out there and changes that you're making to enter those markets?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes, Matthew, this is Steve. It's a similar lifestyle that we support around the country. But I will tell you that the customers out West do have some unique needs. I mean, we do see a higher concentration of some of the C.U.E. businesses that we sell. We're continuing to modify our assortments. The more we learn out there. We went in fairly localized, but we didn't go in as good as we could be, and so we're continuing to tailor our assortments. But a lot of good learnings up to this point and we'll continue to learn as we get more data.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So it sounds like the localization will just potentially come with more knowledge and there's nothing structural about those markets that would be any kind of impediments for you", "there?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "That's correct.", "Operator", "Denise Chai from Bank of America is next.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just wondering why you're saying that C.U.E. will be a lesser headwind to margins than in the past?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Denise, this is Tony. In the past, as we've looked at those numbers, C.U.E. has grown very substantially. And we expect it to continue to grow, but it becomes a little bit less of an impact. One, because of the deflation. And just again, the sort of the law of large numbers. So we'll continue to grow C.U.E. It's a focus, obviously. And then, of course, as we put initiatives around it, we could become much more efficient as we either move the goods and/or manage -- maintain price and do our price management initiatives around it.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then, you mentioned that the first quarter is going very nicely so far. But do you see any of the pantry-filling that took place in the fourth quarter of last year, taking anything away from the first quarter potentially?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Denise, this is Greg. No, we have not. Good steady business, good customer response to the offerings we have out there. So no, we really haven't seen anything change.", "Operator", "Chris Horvers from JPMorgan has the next question.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Last year, you laid out a long-term 14%, 16% EPS algorithm and at the midpoint, you're looking at about 11% year-over-year. So I just -- could you talk about the delta versus long-term trend -- perhaps the expense side is 1%. So what are the other drivers and to tag on to Michael's question, is the -- does the stepped up spending, given the organizational change take you off that long-term forecast?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Right. Yes, I think when you look at the numbers, there's one key number and that's the tax impact. And so as we go into that year, go into 2014, some of the headwind that we have around that relative to WOTC and some of the FIN 48 reserve release last year. If you back up and look at just operating income, I still think that we're in the mid teens. Obviously, as we go into a new year, we're looking at a modeling, where we're making sure that we address all the key expenses as we go through that year, of course, we want to -- we do our best to manage against that budget and try to exceed expectations. So we will work hard throughout the year, but we believe that our target still is to stay in the mid-teens. And we put together an operating model for next year that we believe that we can achieve and that is very reasonable. And hopefully, as we more through the years with our initiatives and our eye on cost, we'll be able to achieve better results.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So the SG&A, it's not as if you -- this SG&A isn't a structural headwind that takes you off that previous view?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "No, it's not. As you move forward and as Greg alluded to, we're constantly going to be investing in the business. There are going to be some years where some of the investment may not be realized until subsequent years. There may be a year like this year where we're going to be moving to the Store Support facility. And those relocation costs and transition costs tend to be -- will be a little bit more impactful this year. So I look at it as a growing business and just continue to make those types of investments that provide us the scalability as we can continue to move forward.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Perfect. And as a follow-up on that, the deflation commentary, is that mainly in seed? Is any of that in the pet food business? And then on the cadence of the year, do you suspect -- are you planning for any quarters, perhaps the third, to just be flat, perhaps negative comps?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes, we see deflation really in a lot of our C.U.E. businesses. I don't want to get real specific in any one category, but it's across several categories. And what was last question on that?", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Do you -- comparison-wise you mentioned the third quarter is the toughest compare out there. Are you planning that to be sort of a flattish comp or do you think there's any potential that could be a negative comp?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "As we planned the year, we do not expect any quarter to have a negative comp.", "Operator", "Your next quarter comes from Adam Sindler, Deutsche Bank.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So first question is on comp guidance for the year. Last year, at the Analyst Day looking [ph] about 3% to 5% longer term. Is the change in comp guidance for 2014 due to your change in the deflation outlook? That's the first question and then just 1 or 2 follow-ups.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Adam, this is Tony. Definitely, the deflation is the most significant impact relative to our outlook on comps. As I've stated earlier, it could have between an inflation of over 100 basis points this year versus 100 next year of deflation. You could have almost a 200-point swing. So that really is the main driver in lowering our comp guidance. And so we believe that, that's really the most impactful number.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then, as you grow out West, sort of as you're looking, building out the stores, I know you have a lot of build out in the Northeast you want to accomplish. But just sort of as you're looking at your growth model, about how long do you think it will take you to reach a point where you start to get some scale on distribution and things like that?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "This is Greg, Adam. We are forecasting that in sometime in '15, we're going to have to have a new distribution center up functional because the store base will be large enough to support it. So that's our target for right now -- sometime in '15.", "Operator", "And next from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse is Gary Balter.", "Andrew Kinder", "It's actually Andrew on for Gary. Just a quick question around the farm bill. It just passed. I realize the farm bill is more geared to larger farms, but are there any provisions that may impact your results?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "This is Tony. When we look at that and obviously studied it prior to being passed, we really believe that there's no significant impact on the business. Again, in the past, a lot of people like to associate farmers and how well they're doing in a particular area to impacting the business. But again, we serve a lifestyle. We serve the rural lifestyle, and that is the preponderance of where our business comes from. And right now, we don't see that customer acting any differently than they have over really the last 2 years.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Two questions for you. First of all, Tony, could you clarify the deflation, what that number was in '13 and what the range of assumptions are for deflation next year?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Sure. When it comes to '13, we looked overall about 70 basis points. I think going into the fourth quarter, we anticipate it to be maybe about 100 basis points on a full year basis. But with the deflation that we experienced in Q4, it wound up to be about 70 basis points for the full year. As we look out into 2014, when we say a range of deflation of about flat to 100 basis points. Again, that's on average for the full year. We expect the first half of the year to be at that higher end of that range, say, around obviously 80 to 100% -- 100 basis points. And then tailing off in the back half, seeing a little bit closer to flattish. Let's say 0 to 20 basis points in the back half of the year.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Great. And then secondly, you gave us some indication of what the Sandy impact was on the compare in 4Q? In terms of where that impact hit, is the bulk of that in November-December? Is that something that has an influence on comps in the early months of 2014? Or how did you see that layer in and influence last year's results?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "It's a good question. We had talked last year. And obviously, there are other companies that experienced a much longer tailwind from the hurricane, especially one as destructive as Sandy was. But we generally have our pickup in the front end, actually, before the hurricane with the hurricane preparedness. And then usually for a month to 6 weeks after, we'll experience the most significant lift. So as we looked at the numbers in Q4, the greatest impact really was in the October timeframe. And tailed off fairly dramatically as we moved into the November timeframe. So there would be very little impact that we would cycle into the first half or first quarter of 2014.", "Operator", "And at this time, there are no further questions. I'll hand things back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you, operator. While our first quarter has gotten off to a good start with the cold weather, let me remind you that March is the most impactful month in the quarter and is very dependent on our spring weather. I want to thank all of those who are invested in Tractor Supply, and I want to personally thank all our team members out there who serve our customers daily and who drive our results. At Tractor Supply, it's always all about the people. Thank you, and we look forward to speaking to you again on our next call regarding our first quarter performance of 2014.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's program.

With me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP, CFO; Steve Barbarick, EVP of Merchandising and Marketing; and Lee Downing, EVP of Store Operations.", "As we announced last week, Lee was promoted to Executive Vice President level and has assumed additional leadership responsibilities for the company's real estate team. I want to acknowledge Lee for his contributions, and I want to congratulate him on this well-earned promotion.", "Now we're very pleased with our overall performance for the quarter and how we are positioned moving toward the all-important second quarter's business. Our first quarter results again demonstrate the underlying strength of our core businesses, along with our ability to effectively manage through volatile weather conditions, in particular in the month of March. In fact, we experienced a significant number of store closure days and distribution center disruptions due to the weather conditions in the first quarter. Our focus continues to be on driving growth and operating income through a balanced approach of managing sales, margins, expenses and inventories. And we believe it is our responsibility to manage these factors effectively, not just for the quarter, but throughout the entire year.", "For Tractor Supply, the timing of sales for spring seasonal products is largely influenced by the arrival of spring-like temperatures throughout all regions of our business. This year, not unlike some years in the past, spring-like temperatures did not occur in many markets until the later weeks of March and into the month of April. Realizing this colder trend in temperature through the first quarter, we made a number of operational shifts to improve our selling position as we move forward into spring/summer. We delayed the flow of spring-related products and altered the shipment of specific seasonal categories such as live goods and outdoor power equipment. We adjusted inventory levels in line with sales and reevaluated our weeks of supply within our replenishment cadence in anticipation of a later selling season. In addition, we planned changes within our marketing program from first quarter into second quarter, allowing for the shift in sales for the Easter holiday timeframe. Our continued ability to read and react early to business conditions continue to improve as a company, and it positions us to optimize forward sales when temperatures do warm.", "Aside from our seasonal categories, the overall business performed very much in line with our expectations in the first quarter. Our comp store transaction count was again very strong, increasing 4.4%. We are clearly meeting the everyday needs of our customers and continuing to drive traffic to our stores. Despite some of the weather impacts affecting the spring season, we do not believe there are any material or fundamental changes in our customer trends, and our sales and earnings expectations for the first half and full year are unchanged.", "Although our internet sales are quite small at this point, we continue to make additional investments in our platform and saw solid progress in our e-commerce sales for the quarter. We now have over 20,000 items on our site, with many available for sale through vendor drop shipment. Cold weather-related categories, such as outerwear and heating products, sold very well in the quarter, and customers took full advantage of our drop ship capability after our stores began exiting these fall/winter categories for the spring transition.", "Our social presence online is also developing, and we are engaging with customers who want to share their Out Here experiences with us. Our mobile presence is growing, and more of our website traffic is coming to us through now a mobile device. We are confident that as we add more capabilities to our website and mobile platform, we can continue to grow our sales and believe that our customers are anxious to take advantage of the new futures as we make them available.", "In the quarter, we also made progress on our CRM or customer relationship management program, and we recently combined our web traffic insights with our traditional CRM data capture to form one view of the customer in our databases across all channels of our business. We believe, over time, this will improve our customer targeting efforts. And we also just completed a personalized communication test with our best customers based upon their purchase behavior. The test results were positive, and with these recent learnings, we now have the confidence that we can move forward toward development of a customer affinity program for 2015.", "Looking at the second quarter, we really remain optimistic and believe there are several positive factors that should benefit our business. The first is the high levels of ground moisture throughout much of the country, which historically has generated demand for lawn and garden products as temperatures warm.", "The second is the shift in the holiday season. 2013 pre-holiday sales were part of our first quarter, and this year, those sales moved into the second quarter.", "And third is the pent-up customer demand for spring seasonal products. While spring may be off to a late start in a number of regions across the U.S., our experience is that the business will come at some point, and we have readied our stores with appropriate levels of inventory to take advantage of the sales opportunities as temperatures warm in the Northeast and Midwest. Weather has always been a factor in our business, and that is why we recommend assessing our performance on a first half and second half basis.", "Now before I turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our Q1 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, I want to acknowledge a recent milestone. We opened our store in Bullhead City, Arizona late in the quarter. This was our 1,300th store. As we expand our Western footprint, Bullhead City represented our 12th store in Arizona and our 57th Tractor Supply store in the Western region. We are proud of this accomplishment and our growth over the years, and I would like to personally thank each of our team members out there who passionately serve our customers and who drive our sales results.", "I will now turn the call over to Tony to review our financial performance for the quarter.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 29, 2014, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 9% to $1.18 billion and net income grew 10.9% to $48.8 million or $0.35 per diluted share. Overall, we are pleased with our bottom line performance for the quarter. While Q1 sales were negatively impacted by the late start to the spring selling season, we drove strong gross margins that provided us the ability to meet our internal plan.", "Comp store sales increased 2.2% in the first quarter, compared to an increase of 0.5% in last year's first quarter. Although it looked like we were up against an easy comparison, let me remind you that comps in the first quarter of 2012 and 2011 were 11.5% and 10.7%, respectively, and benefited from an early start to the spring selling season in both years. This year, the winter selling season was very strong in January and February, as the cold weather drove solid sales performance and assisted us in the clearance of winter product. This contributed to mid-single digit comp gain through February. However, the snow and ice storms were very disruptive to the supply chain.", "As we headed into March, similar to last year, colder-than-average temperatures led to the late start in the spring selling season and resulted in softer sales than originally anticipated. Temperatures in the Northern markets were 5 degrees colder than last year on average and almost 9 degrees colder than historical averages. Although the second quarter has gotten off to a colder-than-anticipated start, we have seen our consumers respond as the weather has warmed to more typical spring conditions, and we are optimistic that this will result in a strong spring selling season.", "As we have often stated, we believe it is more appropriate to assess our performance by the halfs rather than the quarters. Comp transaction count increased for the 24th consecutive quarter, gaining 4.4% on top of a 2.2% increase last year. We continue to drive increased foot traffic by meeting the everyday needs of our customers. C.U.E. items performed well in several categories, such as feed and pet, as well as seasonal C.U.E. items including heating fuel, antifreeze and additives.", "Average comp ticket decreased by 2.1% versus last year's 1.7% decline. The decrease resulted primarily from deflation and a reduction in big-ticket sales related to softness in our storage category. Although we had a solid start to the riding lawnmower season and strong comps in the big-ticket winter items such as log splitters and heaters, it was not enough to offset the softness in the storage category. We estimate that overall, big-ticket sales reduced the average ticket comp by approximately 50 basis points and overall comps by 14 basis points.", "On a regional basis, comp sales were positive across all regions except the Northeast, which was the most impacted by the delayed spring. There were several factors that influenced sales in the quarter. We estimate that deflation negatively impacted comp sales by 80 basis points, which was at the higher end of our forecasted range. The deflation was driven principally by the feed categories. This compares to 140 basis points of inflation in Q1 last year, a swing of 220 basis points. Although deflation has a negative impact on top line sales, it has a favorable impact on margin rate, as I will discuss in a moment. Although the harsh winter had a favorable impact on sales and margin in the early part of the quarter, we were limited in inventory availability in some key replenishable categories, and we consciously did not replenish certain winter categories, such as heating and snow blowers, as we believe that the markdown exposure was greater than the sales benefit. However, we were nimble enough to restage many of our spring purchases as we experienced the delayed spring.", "We had 125 days of store closures due to the harsh winter storms, and we also had a significant increase in the number of store days with reduced hours. We experienced logistics and transportation disruptions related to the winter storms, including 12 closed days at our distribution center. As I mentioned previously, we were cycling strong sales last year in our storage category as a result of anticipated government regulation related to the Sandy Hook tragedy. We were negatively impacted by a later Easter, not only from the signaling of the spring season, but specifically as the Friday and Saturday of Easter weekend fell in our fiscal first quarter last year. Overall, the team did a great job delivering strong results despite these obstacles.", "Turning now to margin, which increased approximately 110 basis points to 33.5%. Our initial direct margin continues to improve as a result of our initiatives around price management, markdown management and strategic sourcing. Import purchases in the quarter increased 9.5% and represented 11.3% of the sales mix. Also, exclusive brand sales increased over 13.5% compared to last year's Q1 and were almost 33% of sales. Deflation was the most significant factor impacting margin. As we focus on maintaining margin dollars per unit, this typically will result in an improvement in gross margin rate in deflationary periods. This provided us the ability to drive a healthy increase in gross profit even though comparable sales were not as strong as previous quarters.", "The favorable colder weather in January and February provided strong sell-through of our seasonal winter products, resulting in fewer markdowns. These improvements in margin rate offset an unfavorable mix variance of approximately 12 basis points, resulting from increased sales in the heating and rider categories, which have lower-than-chain average margin, and an increase in freight as a percent of sales of approximately 17 basis points related to the mix of merchandise and increase in stem miles for our Western expansion.", "For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 26.8% of sales, compared to 26.1% in the prior year's quarter. The deleverage in SG&A was caused by several factors, which include higher cold weather-related costs, including electric, gas, snow removal and building repair, increased distribution cost related to the disruption in the supply chain caused by the weather and the added capacity of the new Southeast distribution center, increased cost of our relocated data center, and as Greg mentioned, we continue to invest in our multichannel platform and tools.", "Also, it should be noted that last year in the first quarter, SG&A leverage benefited from cycling against a much larger incentive compensation expense in 2012, which made the year-over-year increase in SG&A last year much more favorable when compared to this year's increase in SG&A.", "Our effective income tax rate increased 37.6% in Q1, compared to 35% last year. Last year's first quarter benefited from the 2012 WOTC tax credit being reinstated. WOTC has not been reinstated this year. Additionally, we had a reversal of tax reserve pursuant to FIN 48 in last year's first quarter that had a favorable impact on the tax rate.", "Turning to the balance sheet. Although we had sizable purchases under our share repurchase program at the end of Q1, we had a cash balance of $48 million and borrowings of $80 million, compared to a cash balance of $57 million and $105 million of debt last year.", "During the first quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired approximately 1.26 million shares for $84.5 million. Our share repurchase matrix drove aggressive share repurchases, and we were able to acquire the larger quantity than we anticipated. We estimate that the share repurchase program for the quarter did not have a material impact on EPS.", "Average inventory levels per store decreased 0.6% compared to last year as a result of deflation, the strong sell-through of our seasonal merchandise and the restaging of spring receipts to later in the season. The extended winter allowed us to effectively clear through cold winter merchandise, and we ended the season in great shape.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $41.9 million, as compared to $49.3 million last year. And we opened 32 stores in the first quarter, compared to 22 stores in the first quarter of 2013. The decrease in capital expenditures related to cycling expenditures for the construction of our Southeast distribution center last year.", "Turning our attention to the full year outlook. With respect to our financial expectations for the full year 2014, as noted in today's press release, we have reiterated our previous guidance. As a reminder, we still expect full year sales to range from $5.62 billion to $5.7 billion. We have forecasted comp sales to increase between 2.5% and 4%. We are targeting improvement of 20 to 30 basis points in EBIT margin compared to 2013, coming principally from gross margin as a result of several of our key merchandise initiatives and deflation. We expect SG&A percent to be generally flat. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $360 million to $370 million or $2.54 to $2.62 per diluted share.", "And we expect to open 102 to 106 new stores, with approximately 50% to 55% of these to open in the first half of the year. We still expect capital expenditures in 2014 to range between $240 million to $250 million. We will continue to make purchases under the share repurchase program. Given the amount of shares acquired in the first quarter, for modeling purposes, we have adjusted our estimate of diluted shares outstanding to be 141 million for the full year. We continue to estimate deflation for the full year to range between flat to 1%. As grain prices have started to rebound, it is likely -- it is less likely that deflation will be at the higher end of the range.", "Also to reiterate, in terms of cadence, we expect gross margin percent improvement to be greater in the first half of the year, as we will benefit the most from the deflation impact. We believe that the third and fourth quarters will have the toughest comparisons as we cycle the very strong gross margin improvement and very favorable clearance conditions in the prior year. We expect the fourth quarter to possibly decline in gross margin rate based on our current projections.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from John Lawrence with Stephens.", "John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Yes, Greg, would you comment a little bit, first of all, some of the changes that you've made as you went through the period and restaged some of those inventories. Can you give us any sense of, now that you've got another month under your belt, how has that restaging process for certain categories look going forward?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "John, I'll start, and I think I'll ask Steve to probably follow up with this one. When you start seeing the temperatures, which we focused on quite a bit, continue to stay cool, there are certain products that just aren't going to sell. And it's our belief that you don't need to push those products into the stores prematurely because they just start to age on the shelf. So I mentioned live goods, especially. You don't want to be bringing live goods in where there's risk of cold weather and frost. But things like some of the deeper depths and outdoor power equipment, other garden-related-type products and things of that nature are the things that we just had to restage. And the way we can operate with our logistics backhouse now and how that works is we can push the inventory much easier now to those regions where the business is opening up, for example, the Deep South and the West. And that's what we did. We just reallocated and pushed the inventories there, and we've kind of held off on some of those other inventories until the weather starts to warm. We're starting to see that now here in the upper part of the Southeast, and we'll follow that same cadence as we go into the rest of spring. Steve, do you want to comment?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "The only thing I would add to that, John, is that a lot of the outside product that we have, especially for the North, we delayed some of those purchases. Those stores have product now. They're locked and loaded and ready to go. And again, it's the value of being somewhat of a nimble company and being able to react to what we're seeing out there in terms of weather conditions.", "John R. Lawrence - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Great, and just to follow up. Tony, you put some of the comp sort of headwinds in some buckets. You mentioned 80 basis points for deflation. A little bit on the big ticket. Could you break that down maybe to include the closures in the calendar on that sort of decline?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes, John, I didn't give specifics on those because it's very hard to sort of pull those out. Obviously, we have a lot of different factors to consider, such as what is the pent-up demand if a store is closed on the next day and how much of a supply chain disruption would have impacted those stores in being closed. So it's definitely a much smaller amount relative to those 2 that we stated specific numbers for.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So the weather was clearly disruptive in the first quarter. And it sounds like it's still been a bit of a drag in the second quarter to date. So what's giving you the confidence that the business will turn and -- such that you're maintaining your full year guidance and not making any adjustments to that at this point?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Michael, it's Greg. Here's why we're confident. We've seen, as we say in here at the office, we've seen this movie before. We've been here before, seen how the seasons can develop like this, with a much cooler early spring, and business kind of pushes and shifts backward. Now the obvious question probably will be, well, will you be able to capture that business as it is coming later. And our belief is that we will. We have seen this in years past historically, and so we're not concerned at this point that the opportunity for forward sales is -- it's still there. So we feel pretty good about that.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And is there a point at which you get into the season where sales are deferred totally until the following year? And what's the risk associated with that to your comp?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "There are always those points in time, but it's too early in the season to make that call. What we are confident with is what we're seeing right now in the markets where the weather has improved, where the weather is starting to break. There's another thing I should mention, too, is that the levels of moisture that are out in the market today, there's only a couple of places in the country, the severe Western part of Texas and some of the California area is where there's some drought. Other than that, the weather maps that we look at and we track, that moisture level is going to occur. It's there in some places already. And when the snowmelt occurs, that's going also be a nice plus for us, and that's going to continue this shift to that business a little bit longer. So I'd say that I'm not concerned. I mean, last year, the spring weather extended. I think we're going to see the same thing this year.", "Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. My follow-up question is on the deflation. Do you see any evidence when prices do come down that the consumers stock up, such that you could be seeing artificial benefit to your traffic associated with the deflation?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes, I would say that no, that would not the case. We sell -- our products -- customers are buying needed products. If you have animals, you have to feed them, you have to care for them. And Michael, the only time that I could say you may see someone do a little bit of front-loading, or we call it pantry filling, is when we may get very aggressive on price in a certain promotional window. And as you well know, we run only about 15, 16 rotations of promotion a year. So that is -- it's just not our -- it's just not our model.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "No, one thing I would add to that, because I think there is value in this, is that there are some discretionary categories like bird feeding, that when the prices do come down, you get a lot more people that are interested in it. And if you look at our comp transaction growth, we continue to see a lot more footsteps in the door. And I think that there's value over that because we have seen it over time. It's not like this has been a short window of deflation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "First question is on the seasonal products, I think, Greg, you mentioned that the riders were actually off to a decent start. So trying to square that with the late spring, I know you talked about the ground moisture. Was there regional strength in the riders or what do you think is going on there?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "You're absolutely correct, Peter. There is very strong regional strength in that category. And I think Steve and the team did a great job this year with the lineup of products. I think, in the store side, Lee would echo that comment. And that gives us some confidence, knowing that the moisture levels are what they are as we move further North, that you're going to need to have probably either that machine or you're going to be buying parts, some replacement parts for a machine you have. So we think the category is going to perform fine for the year. We will not, today, tell you that we think it's going to be anything more than it probably was maybe a year ago. It's too early, again, to make that call. But we're encouraged with the early business that we're seeing in the markets where we have the weather.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then your new store productivity, it continues to be very strong and consistent despite some of the weather challenges, et cetera. But can you just talk about what you're seeing in the new markets now as you're opening and how kind of how you see the openings coming going forward?", "Lee J. Downing", "Peter, this is Lee. The range of stores that we have, and we continue to have a mix across the country. So to distinguish between the West and the East is probably not really worthy of the time, but I will say that we continue to perform above our pro forma across the entire network, and we're very happy with those results. So I feel like that seasonally, a new store is not necessarily quite as impacted as some others just because of the new customer base that starts to come in. So we typically plan for that when we see -- when we put our new stores out there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So I was just -- not to beat up the weather too much, but I was curious if you could talk about generically over the quarter how the feed and the food categories performed.", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Chris, this is Steve Barbarick. You heard from Tony and Greg that January and February actually started off pretty strong. And a lot of that we gave back in March. So if you look at the C.U.E. categories, and Tony made reference to this in his opening comments, they continue to perform very well. We continue to believe we're picking up market share in a number of those categories. We continue to broaden our assortments, make sure we're priced right, and we are a dependable suppliers. So we feel very good about where we're positioned there.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "And Chris, this is Tony, clearly, when you look at the numbers, the dropoff that we saw in March was related to the seasonal categories. And so as Steve alluded to, the C.U.E. items really were very strong throughout the entire quarter.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Understood. And then as you think about the deflation, maybe you can talk about how quickly that price tends to get passed or the inflation that you're starting to see in March, how quickly that gets passed through, how quickly maybe it turns? And is there actually a chance that perhaps as you get to 4Q, you could see some inflation reemerge in your ticket?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes, as we've talked in the past, the inflation, deflation is most impactful on some of our higher-turning categories. Depending on how the product or the prices increase throughout the year, there is the potential that we could have some slight inflation in the fourth quarter. But currently, as we see it -- and again, our forecasting is based on this point in time, looking at today's prices compared to what we're cycling for the rest of the year, and that's how we'll generate our forecast. But right now, we see the prices increasing. It hasn't had that dramatic of an increase. We're still anticipating on a full year basis that we will be somewhere between the flat and 1% in deflation.", "Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, perfect. And one -- just one last one. Could you actually maybe quantify the closures year-to-year or how you saw spring play out in the non-weather-affected markets in March, that would be great.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, I would say that you've got -- it's a very small percentage of stores that were closed for any significant period of time. But the disruption of -- just for example, if you open a store at 8 in the morning, which is our typical opening time, and then the weather hits and the store has to close by 10 or 11 and we lose the sales for the remainder of that day and maybe possibly the next day, those are the kind of impacts that in the Upper Midwest and the Northeast we faced considerably in the month of March. Not so much -- we had some of it in February, but a lot of it in March with those storms coming through. And then on top of that, Chris, if you can imagine, the manufacturing base also experiencing issues, where they couldn't even -- could not ship the product from their locations either to our DCs or to our stores to replenish. So we had a bit of a moving target through that 6-week period there, dealing with a lot of that shift. But it was primarily the, we call them, regions, I think, 2, 4, and 5. It's, say, the part of Michigan across Pennsylvania up into the Northeast, which really -- and the latter part of the spring season is where we see a lot of our outdoor power equipment businesses and things of that nature and we will still see that business. So the disruption was short term. We've lived through it. We've worked our way through it. We're comfortable with our forward assortments. And I think we've got that opportunity to capture the sales yet.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Chris, it's Tony. Real quick, we estimate there was about 25 closed store days last year in the first quarter. So obviously, a significant larger number. And the one takeaway that I would have on the January, February timeframe is that the business could have been even stronger than it was if it wasn't for some of the store closures and the disruption in the supply chain. So we're really pleased with the way the business has performed in January and February. And again, with a cold March, we would expect sales to be a little bit softer.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "If you could talk a little bit about the great start to the store openings. You had a pretty good run rate with 32 openings in the first quarter. What does that tell us about their ability to contribute to earnings as the year progresses. Do they ramp up that much faster?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Chuck, this is Tony. We definitely like to get off to a quick start. There are some significant benefits, but obviously, a full year of productivity with a new store will benefit the full year. Since we opened so many stores on a year-over-year basis, I don't think it will have a dramatic impact. But clearly, in our model, where service is a key driver and it continues to drive additional footsteps as we become more aware in a particular community, it clearly will help drive some incremental sales for the full year.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. And then returning to the near term, if -- could you tell us, Tony, what the delta in comps was between March and what you're seeing so far in April, without giving us the actual comp numbers for those periods?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Well, as we had alluded to in the prepared remarks, when we see the weather break, the customer clearly responds. And so as we have had warmer -- the warmer trends in some of the areas of the country, the consumer has responded actually very well. And that's what's giving us the indications that the weather pattern this year is relatively consistent with what we experienced last year. And as we went through last year, we saw the real expedition of sales in the May timeframe. So we feel that we're tracking very close to our expectations, given the weather pattern that we've experienced though March and into April. And I would tell you that it is trending positive relative to our March sales pattern.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "As you move into some of these new markets -- I guess this is a follow-up kind of similar to, I believe it was Peter's question -- as you move kind of West, what kind of return -- how does the return profile of some of these stores change? And specifically regarding kind of labor and occupancy, does that actually ease or is it dependent on what kind of market you're heading into or is California actually more expensive? Can you just give us some general clarification on that?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Sure, Scot. This is Tony. As we talked about in the past, our model, when we approve a store, were driven based off of a 10-year discounted forecast -- discounted model. And we set a hurdle rate. So when we look at a particular store, as much as you like to have that higher-volume store, the key is going to be the bottom line results and how much cash it throws off over that period of time. So as we move out in California, generally, you're going to have much stronger sales base. And obviously, the rents are going to be much, much higher. What we see, and the only difference between a store in the Southeast and a store in California or the Southwest, is the various ramps. So as we have a significant ramp in a store with, say, $100,000 of rent, you can really start to drop that to -- the profit, to the bottom line. In California, again, you start with a higher base, and if you have that acceleration, again, you can really start to leverage those fixed expenses. So the model will work very consistently throughout. Payroll is a little bit higher out West, as well as the supply chain. And obviously, we'll start to cure that as we develop a Southwest distribution center over the next 1.5 years. So when we look at it across the board, again, it really is centered on making sure that we meet their hurdle rate when we approve a store. After that point in time, on an aggregate basis, the stores will perform fairly consistently.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Tony, because you don't have as much store density out there, does the maturity curve look much different than what you would see on the, let's call it, the East Coast?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "No, it actually -- right now, just based on the stores that we've had out there -- and we've had California stores actually since 2004. I would tell you that they perform consistently with those on the East Coast.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.", "Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Greg, you mentioned that due to the weather, you made some shifts in the marketing expenditures, pushing some programs from 1Q to 2Q. If you hit your revenue goals in Q2, whatever that may be, what is the anticipated effect on the marketing spend in Q2?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, as a percent of sales, it will probably come down, I think, now that we've seen what's happening. But remember, we made a conscious decision to make that shift due to the movement of Easter. And we also anticipated that we could have a bit of an extended spring, which is exactly what we are now seeing. So as a percent of sales, it will probably be a little less than what we initially planned. But for the half, it will be relatively the same, probably be on plan.", "Alan M. Rifkin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a follow-up, if I may, with respect to the DC. So if you do the math, the store closures represent a pretty small fraction of the total store days in the quarter, maybe 0.1%. I was wondering, the 12 days that the DC was closed, what was the -- how many stores did that affect? And as a follow-up to that, for how long do you anticipate deleverage coming from the new Southeast DC?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Okay, let's take it in 2 steps. The DC closures, you have to put it in perspective to -- into 2 buckets here. One is closure of the DC due to weather and our inability to operate because the team members can't get there, and secondly, the inability of the manufacturers to move product by truck, which typically how it comes to us to the DC. So we've got 2 variables working here. It's hard to say how many absolute stores. I can tell you that probably 3 of our regions were most affected, some in the Southwest, some in the Northeast. Primarily, though, the 2 areas, it's kind of where that swath of weather kept coming through. It would come from the Southwest and sweep up through the Northeast, hit a little bit in the Midwest. So it really hit 3 of our buildings. So if I look at that, they've got to serve somewhere probably around 450 stores, in that range. Now it didn't affect every store every day, depending upon the days that these storms came through and the disruptions. But it was quite disruptive, I will say that. As far as the deleveraging on that Southeast DC, we're going to cycle through that here as we get through the summer period, to get through the June, July, when we opened that building a year ago. So that's -- they're going to be behind this year shortly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just want to follow up on what you were saying about restaging your spring seasonal products. Was this actually disruptive to your store operations? What kind of lead time do you need to give your vendors? And can you give us a sense of those one-off weather-related costs in terms of utilities and snow removal in SG&A?", "Lee J. Downing", "Denise, I'll take it first. This is Lee. As far as store operations goes, when you start restaging product, it really doesn't hurt a whole lot, because in the Northeast or in the Northern areas where there's still snow on the ground, a lot of that product is outside. So I mean, it actually helps us to restage, so we don't have to try to do work in the snow. So I think it's really actually helpful when we restage the product. So it probably makes us much more productive in stores. I'll let Steve answer the rest of that.", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes, in terms of working with our supplier community, we have weekly calls with our key suppliers when we go into spring. They see this, not only with Tractor Supply, but with a lot of their other customers. Because of our purchasing power, we're typically prioritized, and we haven't seen any real hiccups or supply chain issues relative to those goods that we've delayed.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And is there anything you can say about the additional costs from snow removal and utilities?", "Lee J. Downing", "I would tell you that it actually was a significant increase over last year. And it really -- when you look at the various numbers, the occupancy -- increase in occupancy, because of those line items, was the most significant one as far as the deleveraging that we experienced in the first quarter.", "Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Just one follow-up here. What categories do you think that you're taking market share in?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes, we typically talk about the C.U.E. business in general. And we've always talked a little bit about the fact that when it comes to livestock feed and some of the other categories, we go into a community, and there is a lot of people who carry what we have, but we offer a different experience. We put it all under one roof. We're open typically more hours and more days, and our customers tend to gravitate to us that way. So we think there's a variety of categories where we continue to win, and we will continue to make sure that our assortments are right, that we're priced right and that we're a dependable supplier.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.", "Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "First question is on gross margins. You talked about deflation being the largest driver of gross margin improvement year-over-year. Can you help rank order the other drivers you mentioned, which 1 or 2 were most important?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Sure. This is Tony. When we look at it -- and again, when we analyze gross margin and the improvements, there is a lot of overlap. So if I were to break it down, we -- because of the -- deflation was obviously the largest. Then when we look at imports, I would probably categorize as next. Depending on how you break out the price optimization piece, because again, there is a portion in which we manage deflation through the price optimization. I would probably say that falls in -- as your second category and -- or second or third category. And then the way we manage the clearance throughout the quarter. And again, some of that is the improved management and the tools that we're using, as well as the weather giving us the ability to be able to clear with less markdowns. So it's difficult to rank them, and I think that once you get past the deflation, those categories for the most part are all in about the same ballpark.", "Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That's helpful. As we think about the go forward through the balance of the year, is it appropriate to think about the same type of magnitude of benefit to gross margins from those drivers outside of deflation?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Generally, when it comes to our initiatives around price optimization, strategic sourcing, they have been fairly consistent. My one hesitation on that question is around the markdowns, because obviously, a lot of it has to do with how much inventory we're buying, how the season ends and then obviously, then the tools that we have around that to try to maximize the clearance. So I would look at a couple of those as being very consistent. But when it comes to the markdown management, that is going to vary from quarter to quarter.", "Seth Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Great. And one last follow-up. Could you quantify for us the Easter shift? How much benefit is expected to shift from Q1 to Q2 because of the timing of Easter?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes, when it comes to that, we had obviously 2 days last year, and it obviously was the sort of the buildup to Easter. We are closed on Easter Sunday. So we actually lose that comp day, which does match up between the quarters. So there is no change in comp days through the quarter. So you're really looking at just a fairly limited impact when it comes to that subsequent Monday because there is a pent-up demand, since we're closed on Sunday, and those 2 days before. So net-net, between the 2 quarters, you're probably looking at around low double digit, you know, maybe 10 basis points.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Two questions for you. First of all, as you think about the shift in your business associated with the weather, the delayed spring, and you think about how that plays out respectively for traffic, ticket and gross margin, versus what an ordinary spring would look like, how would you think about those moving pieces?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Matt, this is Greg. I believe that when you have the temperatures to sell spring/summer product, the traffic count typically from -- and what we've seen historically is there. It can be fairly violent, meaning that it can come quick, fast and furious, in a matter of 10 days to 2 weeks to maybe stretching to 3 weeks, depending upon how late that temperature impact occurs. We're expecting some of that, honestly, in the Northeast, where there's still snow on the ground. And it's going to be probably mid- to late-May scenario, but the big impact of what I look at when I look at ticket and looking at is traffic, traffic count. And the fact that our footsteps were up in that first quarter, and we continue to see strength in that footstep. When this weather does open up, and it will, we do not anticipate that, that's going to slow at all. As a matter of fact, it should accelerate.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And in terms of the average transaction size associated with that traffic, given the mix that you anticipate to see and also what that mix would mean for gross margin, obviously, the mix benefited grosses a bit in Q1, does it go the other way in Q2 or not necessarily?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "It could move back a little bit with the sale of a lot of big-ticket product. That is true. We know that. We manage to that. But I would tell you that the average ticket will also move up. So we'll start to see a little bit more leverage and SG&A cost. So it's kind of there's good guys and bad guys in that mix. But we anticipate that. We plan for that now, and we've recalibrated for that. So I feel, I'm fairly confident that it could be a little later, but it will still come.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then the quick follow-up. You had discussed at various times some discreet investment spending for 2014. I think you'd quantified that. Is there any way to quantify the degree to which that impacted Q1 and whether the cadence of the impact is on plan with your original thought process?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Matt, Tony. Our capital spending is very consistent with what we had anticipated going in. And we continue to make investments in several different areas, in particular e-commerce. And then as we move forward through the second half of the year, we'll be making investments in our clearance optimization, as well as in demand planning. So those are 3 of the big ones, as well as, I guess, a fourth would be the CRM that Greg talked about as well in his prepared remarks. So when we look at the first quarter, one of the variables that occurred is, if you remember, back at the end of 2012, we had taken a charge relative to our e-commerce platform. And so as we cycled through into Q1 this year, and we had made some investments last year in our new platform, we started to see that come through to Q1, obviously, in the form of depreciation, whereas we had very minimal last year. So from an impact on the quarter, there was definitely $1 million to $1.5 million of what I would term additional investment that was charged in this quarter versus what we saw last year in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Somebody broached the topic of outdoor space earlier, so I wanted to just dig into that again, which I do often. But by my calculations, your sales per square foot in the outdoor area are about 15% of the sales per square foot of your inside area. Home Depot and Lowe's, by my calculations, do like 40% to 50% outdoor to indoor. I'm just wondering where that fits on your priority list and if you can help us just dimensionalize the opportunity there, and if you have enclosed any of those areas to kind of get more business out of them, what kind of results you see from those types of stores.", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes, absolutely. This is Steve again. We do see opportunity with the outside of our stores, and we continue to test and try new things. Last year, we got more into live goods, bag mulches and soils that are outside. We've got a number of stores right now that we're testing an ability where customers can go directly into the yard without going through the door first. And we'll see how that pans out for us as we get through the spring season here, because it's a relatively new change that we made. We have also got forage product, which we didn't have a few years ago, that's outside. And we have got some other new things that we're testing out there as well in terms of product. So we recognize that this could be a potential opportunity for us. We've just got to figure out how we get customers in there, comfortable in that area, open those doors. And while we don't have an awning today, we believe there's more potential as well. We will continue to test and try, I can promise you that.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC", "And then if it's okay, on the segmentation, it was mentioned at the top of the call as well. I know you've kind of been prioritizing that recently and probably are learning something from it every week. Can you kind of just help us figure out what types of surprises you're learning as you segment your customers, what you are seeing and maybe what actions you've been taking and what results or response you see from kind of that CRM implementation?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes, this is Steve again. There's always a lot of learning with the evolution of a retail store and chain. And I would tell you that over time, and I've been with the organization -- this is my 17th year. We've seen a change and a modification in our customers and their behavior. We talked a little bit about our lifestyle customer. They tend to live closer to our stores. They tend to buy more convenience-type products. There's a reason we've had multiple quarters of comp transaction growth, and we believe a lot of that is bringing in new customers because of the products that we're carrying in our stores and how we're marketing them. So we've talked about gardening products. We've talked a little bit about pet products. And there's other categories that are at our store that are more broad-based, and we're getting the word out on those categories, bringing in new products and expanding our lines, without necessarily disenfranchising our core customer, because I think you can do both at the same time. Recently, Greg mentioned that we did a test on one of the segments that we have. It was a personalized test with touch points in digital, e-mail, along with direct mail. And of the groups that we talked to within the segment, we saw positive ROI with each one in their shopping behavior back to us. And that gives us confidence, that as we move forward with an affinity program in '15, that it's going to work and pay dividends for us in the future. We've also made a strategic hire, a Director of Customer Marketing, a position we didn't have before. And we believe that, that will add tremendous value for us in the future as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.", "Jonathan N. Berg - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "This is Jon Berg on for Peter tonight. We're just curious in looking at how a tough winter may or may not drive stronger lawn and garden sales. And I know it's probably difficult at this point to tell whether or not it's improving demand in the Northern parts of the country, but maybe in a state like Georgia, that saw greater snow and ice this year, have you seen a stronger-than-expected pickup in sales in that category?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Jon, I would tell you -- this is Greg. I would say to you that again, we don't talk in specific state, but I can say that in the Deep South and in the South, where temps have warmed and they were much cooler earlier and kind of somewhat suppressed customer demand, the business is opening up. And we're very encouraged with what we're seeing. As Steve said earlier, the number of new programs that are out there in the stores that are really temperature sensitive. And I think anyone that's in some of these businesses will tell you the same. So comfortable, confident that we've got a good trend going there, and we believe that trend will just continue to move north as temperatures warm.", "Jonathan N. Berg - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. As my follow-up, Tony, is there any way you could provide any color or quantification maybe around what markdowns did for your gross margin in the quarter?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "We don't provide that information, again, because as we work through technically what is clearance and what the impact is on sort of price optimization or what the impact price optimization had on the clearance -- some of the mix changes, I don't think it would benefit to try to quantify specifically. Net-net, you're going to be somewhere in the -- again, just the low double-digit territory.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I was hoping you could just walk us through sort of what the trends were like last year in the second quarter? I believe that, as you said, April did start a little bit weak again. And then sort of how it ramped. And then maybe if there is any sort of just geographic differences this year versus last year. And then on the cost side, just remind us what you guys are expecting for the DC -- the headquarters relocation and some of the other projects you have planned for the back half of the year.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "All right, Adam, this is Tony. Just to give you the background, when we went into Q2 last year, obviously, April was the softest month and the significant spike occurred in May. And then a strong June, but not in the same ballpark as the strength of May, but still a very strong performance in June. As we move into this quarter, as we've said before, it appears as if we're running the same pattern. And so that's what we're looking at and anticipating as we move into Q2. The one big advantage we had last year, and again, we're very hopeful that trend will continue, is it was not only a delayed spring but an extended spring and it even moved into Q3. And we had a very strong July and August. So that will be a key. And again, one of the main drivers is the moisture that's in the ground. Obviously, rainfall that occurs through the second quarter will be beneficial as well to drive that spring into Q3.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Adam, this is Greg. On some of the initiatives and some of the capital outlays, Tony mentioned about demand planning for the latter part of this year. I mentioned earlier in my comments about some of the work we did in CRM early in the quarter. And now we'll be working towards '15 for some of that implementation. The headquarters building, our Store Support Center, will be completed and will begin occupancy with our first move, sometime probably in July or early August, hopefully, to have everyone under one roof by the end of the year. But again, that all depends upon how smooth the first move takes place. But right now, I think everything that we're working through and working on from a spend standpoint is coming -- falling within the plan. We've got some things we're doing in the distribution network as well. So I think we're in good shape.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Two questions. You talked about the loyalty card and you talked about online. Just curious if you could frame what success looks like in terms of those initiatives, in terms of the payback that we might see in results?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Eric, you said loyalty and -- we missed the...", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Loyalty. Loyalty and online.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Okay, online, okay. Steve, do you want to talk about...", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes, I'll talk to the loyalty program. We call it an affinity program here. Again, this is about capturing data from our customer, bringing them to an opt-in position with us and then communicating with them over the course of time, the way they want to be communicated to, that's relevant to their lifestyle and their needs. We haven't put a dollar amount to it at this juncture. We're still in the process of the RFP and trying to understand all the dynamics of that. But at the end of the day, we want to get to know our customer better, and whether that be the content that they want to see online, how they want to be talked to and what kind of -- what they're looking for from Tractor Supply Company. We believe we've got a customer base out there that wants to be more engaged with us, and this will open the opportunity for us to do so.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Eric, this is Tony. Just to tag on to what Steve said. We have been very deliberate in our approach to the loyalty program. And it all centers around designing something that the customer wants and isn't necessarily something that would degregate [ph] margin. So when we look at that and design that, we want to be very careful, because we understand that we're a destination store. And it's not as critical to try to entice people to come into our -- into the store. So the design is going to be very critical for it to be successful, so that we can capture information about our customer and be able to correspond with them.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Eric, this is Greg. I'll talk about the online for a moment. We mentioned in our prepared remarks about drop shipment, and what we saw was the consumer still having a need for certain fall/winter products that we were already starting to exit in the 4-wall store, but they took full advantage of because they were available through the drop ship program with certain vendors online. That was a bit of a surprise but a great learning for us. It helps us extend some of the seasons with no risk. The mobile business, we don't have -- we have a mobile site that is capable now. But we're seeing people come through the mobile, some type of mobile platform, into our website and exchange, not only information with us, looking to exchange commerce. So we've got some interesting things happening. It's still very early for us. There's still lots of learning. But we're excited about what we're seeing.", "Operator", "And our last question will be from Gary Balter from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "One question is just a follow-up. On the gross margin, obviously, you talked about spring seasonal getting delayed. If we think about the gross margin on the different merchandise, is that a higher-margin category, putting aside the deflation impact, et cetera, than C.U.E., some of the things that you did sell through in Q1?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes, Gary, Tony. The spring assortment and seasonal categories will generally be a higher margin and will be beneficial. My only caveat would be strong riding lawnmower season, which tends to be well below chain average. But we obviously love to get that customer in because then we turn them into hopefully a customer for life, and we can service their repairs and their other needs relative to that. So we anticipate right now a reasonable season that generally will correspond from a margin standpoint to the prior year.", "Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then just to follow up, Greg, maybe I go back too far with this company, but in the past, years ago, you used to talk about resetting the right side of the store and then the left side of the store. And obviously, it's been extremely successful. If you look at the inside of the store, are there areas that you still feel are underperforming, that are a focus of resetting or remerchandising?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes, this is Steve, I will tell you that this is a culture of being relentlessly dissatisfied. I can tell you, we're probably not happy with the majority of the inside of our store, and we think we've got upside just about everywhere. So the merchant team, working with our space planning team, is looking at every square inch, every peg, every 4-way and every shelf to optimize the opportunity. So I would tell you, yes, we're still working on it.", "Operator", "That conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Guiler, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Okay, thank you, everyone. In closing, I'd like to thank all of you who are invested in Tractor Supply and all of our team members out there living the lifestyle, serving our customers and driving our company's performance. We believe 24 consecutive quarters of comp transaction count growth, and 18 consecutive quarters of positive comparable store sales is evidence that customers are increasingly looking to Tractor Supply as a one-stop shop for rural lifestyle needs, and we continue to strive to be the most dependable supplier of those needs. Thank you for spending time with us today, and we look forward to sharing our second quarter results with you during our next call in late July.", "Operator", "That concludes today's presentation.

With me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and CFO; Lee Downing, our EVP of Store Operations and Real Estate; and Steve Barbarick, EVP of Merchandising and Marketing is out of town today attending a trade show so he will not be with us.", "Now although the second quarter did not fully live up to our expectations I am pleased with how our team reacted and managed the business. Weather is always going to play some role in our business results and it is our job to manage successfully to all those types of external factors. What we faced in the second quarter of this year was different than previous years and I believe we reacted accordingly.", "Now heading into the second quarter we anticipated that the quarter would start slow based on the cool weather patterns and late start to the spring selling season. Based on years past we expected that weather patterns would begin to normalize in May and we would see a spike in the spring seasonal business mid quarter. However that pattern did not hold true this year particularly in our northern markets where the weather turned warmer much later than normal. Instead of a spike we saw a much more gradual build in the seasonal business throughout the quarter. We reacted midway through the quarter by enhancing a few remaining key promotional events focusing on things that would drive sales and traffic while maintaining the integrity of our everyday value pricing model. ", "These promotions included the advancement of our 4th of July circular by one week, a second and more timely demo days sell event for the northern regions and an improved targeted distribution of our remaining circulars and direct mails. These actions resulted in improved redemption rates and while this had a modest impact on our overall margins in the quarter it did drive sales of seasonal categories midway through the quarter.", "As weather became less of a factor in the northern markets we noticed a return to more normal sales trends. The momentum continued as the quarter progressed but again this was much more gradual than years past. June sales were strong and that strength has carried over into the first few weeks of July. This has given us confidence that the weaker sales trends in the first half of the year were in fact weather related while our underlying fundamental traffic and core businesses remained healthy with sales that were lost early in the second quarter and as such we adjusted our full year outlook in our business update just two weeks ago.", "Tony will review the financials of the quarter in more detail but let me give you a few highlights. Comparable transaction count increased 2.3% making this our 25th consecutive quarter of positive comp transaction count. Comparable store sales were positive in each of the three months with the second half of the quarter above our expectations and the first half below our expectations. Regionally comparable store sales in the south significantly outperformed comparable sales in the north and not all spring seasonal sales products performed the same. We observed strength in grass seed, live goods, fencing and riding lawn mowers and in riding lawn movers it's been several years since we've seen a positive year-over-year sales comparison in that category.", "But on the flip side we saw weakness in the outdoor power equipment such as tillers and chain saws as well as we saw weakness in accessories for mowers, trimmers and in the safe category. So for the quarter we made a number of inventory investments in key categories early on and we were pleased with how these categories performed. And we know that when we support product category from both a merchandizing and branding perspective and we place the inventory we typically do well and drive those sales that were re-targeted in those categories. For example our garden event, another big success again this year and that benefited from further investments in that category in both live goods and core products. ", "So while the early part of the quarter was not fully inline with our expectations we were pleased with the way it ended and the way that we managed the seasonal business and the underlying strength in our core business throughout the quarter.", "I'll now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of the financials after which I will offer a few closing comments and forward look on the second half of the year.", "Anthony F. Crudele ", "Thanks Greg and good afternoon everyone. For the quarter ended June 28, 2014 on a year-over-year basis net sales increased 8.8% to $1.58 billion and net income grew by approximately 8% to $133.4 million and $0.95 per diluted share. Comparable store sales increased 1.9% for the second quarter compared to last year's increase of 7.2%. As Greg discussed the seasonal side of the quarter got off to a slow start as a result of the cold weather that continued further into May and in the prior year. Sales did not start to rebound until halfway through the quarter as spring finally broke and the build was much more gradual than last year. This was especially the case with our northern stores. ", "Sales were consistent with our plan in the back half of the quarter at June posted a solid comp and was the strongest comp month in the quarter. Comparable store sales were driven by continued strength of consumable, usable and edible products, our C.U.E. items and healthy traffic counts. Comp transaction count increased from the 25th consecutive quarter, gained 2.3% on top of a 4.8% increase last year. Certain spring categories performed very well such as live good grass seeds and fencing. These favorable trends were partially offset by weaker than expected sales of other seasonal categories in the North and continued declines in our safe category resulting from difficult comparisons from a year ago. ", "Average comp ticket decreased by 30 basis points compared to last year's 2.3% increase. The decrease resulted principally from deflation of 100 basis points. An increase in items per transaction and favorable mix impact partially offset the negative impact of deflation. ", "The impact of big ticket was slightly negative as the increases we saw in the [inaudible] were more than offset by the declines in the safe category. A few key points about the quarter. As Greg mentioned, although we have seen solid comp sales performance in our spring seasonal categories in June and the first three weeks of July it is difficult to assess whether we will recapture all the lost sales resulting from the late spring. If you recall last year's third quarter benefited from a late and extended spring and summer selling season. Although the general pattern is similar to last year the build of the seasonal business has been more gradual this year and we do not know how this trend will progress. So while we are pleased with the comp performance so far in Q3 we do face difficult comparisons in the third quarter particularly in July and August when comps increase close to double-digits last year. ", "On a regional basis, our warmer southern regions outperformed our cooler northern regions as the southern regions were the least impacted by the delayed spring weather. All three months had positive comp sales with June tracking at our internal comp target. ", "Although big-ticket items as a group had a positive comp for the quarter, it was still a slight headwind to average ticket. Since the big ticket comp percent was less than chain average and the big ticket sales were a smaller mix of total sales from the softness in the safe category it had a slight negative impact on average ticket. ", "Deflation was approximately 100 basis points which is slightly higher than we expected. Last year's second quarter had approximately 140 basis points of inflation making the year-over-year swing 240 basis points. ", "Turning now to gross margin, which as a percentage of sales was flat to prior year at 34.8%. Our initial direct margin improved as a result of our initiatives around price optimization, markdown management and strategic sourcing. Import purchases in the quarter increased 8.1% and represented 11.5% of the sales mix. Also exclusive brand sales increased 9.4% compared to last year's Q2 and were almost 30.7% of sales. Deflation was the most significant favorable factor impacting margin as we focused on maintaining margin dollars per unit that typically will result in an improvement in gross margin rate in deflationary periods. ", "Offsetting the benefits from deflation and our margin enhancing initiatives was merchandise mix which we estimate had a negative impact of approximately 13 basis points. This was primarily related to the rider category that has a lower than average margin and had a solid year-over-year increases, and the softness in several of the seasonal categories that carry above chain average margin. The softness in seasonal sales also resulted in C.U.E. being a higher mix of sales for the quarter which in aggregate carry a lower than average margin. ", "Freight increased approximately 14 basis points as we had increased transportation rates related to inbound truck capacity and availability as well as an increase in store stem miles to the new western store base. Additionally the freight rate will increase as a percentage relative to sales and cost of goods in a deflationary period. The enhanced sales driving events during the quarter that Greg referred to also modestly impacted margin. ", "For the quarter SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 21.5% of sales, an increase of 27 basis points over the prior year quarter. Although we managed SG&A dollars well, we still de-levered as result of the short fall in sales. We knew that some of the investments we put in place in the second half of 2013 would make it difficult to leverage SG&A in the second quarter and this was exaggerated by the limited comp sales increase. We began to anniversary some of these investments in the back half of this year, for example we will cycle the added expense of the relocation of the Southeast distribution center and the relocation of our data center in the second half of 2014. ", "The largest variance was employee benefits where medical cost and workers' comp expense have been running higher than plan. Incentive compensation was favorable and offset a significant portion of the deleverage. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.7% in Q2 compared to 37.4% last year. The decrease was due principally to the timing of recognition of state and federal income tax credits.", "Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of Q2 this year and last year we had a cash balance of $36 million and no outstanding debt. During the second quarter under our stock repurchase program we acquired approximately 961,000 shares for $62.5 million. We estimate that the share repurchase program did not have a material impact on EPS for the quarter.", "Average inventory levels per store at quarter end were 3.4% lower than last year, while annualized inventory turns increased by three basis points for the quarter. We are pleased with the productivity of the inventory during the quarter as the team did an excellent job flowing early spring orders as sales demand warranted and managed seasonal inventories throughout the quarter. Overall we do not anticipate any markdown exposure in Q3 outside of our normal clearance activity.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40.2 million, compared to $49.3 million last year. We opened 23 stores this quarter compared to 26 stores in the second quarter of 2013. The decrease in capital expenditure relates to expenditures for the construction of our Southeast distribution center last year.", "Turning our attention to full year outlook, based on the second quarter results the company believes its fiscal year 2014 results will be at the low end of the previous provided ranges which were net sales of $5.62 billion to $5.7 billion, comparable store sales of 2.5% to 4% and net income of $2.54 to $2.62 per diluted share.", "We have reduced our estimated range for capital expenditures by $20 million to $220 million to $230 million. The new store pipeline is tracking to our full year goal of 102 to 106 new stores. Based on the volume of our share repurchase year-to-date we are also adjusting our estimate for full year diluted shares outstanding to approximately 140 million.", "We now expect deflation to be higher than originally anticipated for the back half of the year as corn prices which is a directional indicator continue to remain low. We are now estimating deflation to range between 50 and 100 basis points in the second half with the third quarter being closer to the high end and moderating slightly down in the fourth quarter.", "The safe category will continue to be headwind but the merchant team has put together a solid plan to drive total sales in the back half of the year. We expect gross margin to be flat to slightly in the second-half of the year. The fourth quarter will be tougher comparison in the back half as strong seasonal sell through last year minimized markdowns. We will continue to have freight and mix headwinds that will offset some of the benefits of our key gross margin initiatives. ", "With respect to SG&A, our store support center consolidation into our new campus is on budget and on time and will be completed before the end of the third quarter. The anticipated lease termination and transition cost will be incurred and expensed in the third quarter which we estimate to be $0.01 to $0.015 per diluted share.", "We have a very focused plan to manage SG&A expense in the back half of the year and we expect to leverage SG&A in the back half principally in the fourth quarter, as we begin to cycle the investments made in the back half of last year. We expect SG&A leverage to be closer to flat in Q3 as a result of the store support center transition cost I just mentioned.", "We forecast that our effective tax rate for the full year will be approximately 36.9% compared to our previous guidance of 37%. To conclude our core business remains strong.

Looking forward to the second half of 2014 we are focused on driving sales and operating margin growth for the full year. Last year the spring and summer selling season extended well into the third quarter and we benefited from having inventory in the right mix of seasonal products. ", "Our success in third quarter last year presents us with a challenging comparison this year but nevertheless we feel we are well prepared given how well we ended the second quarter with inventory and how we have successfully transitioned our assortments toward fall. In the second half of the year we have several merchandising initiatives which we are excited about including a number of direct mail campaigns, looking at a target distribution of our circulars and numerous in-store events focused on driving more footsteps into our stores. ", "While we will selectively sprinkle in a few individual store level efforts we are diligent in maintaining our everyday value pricing model. We also have our seasonal center court that I should mention where we also introduce new products that also support our customer\u2019s lifestyle and drive business.", "So in closing I\u2019d like to thank our dedicated team members in the field distribution centers and here at the store support center for all the hard work and dedication to our company and our shareholders and the investment community for your continued support. We feel comfortable about the underlying trends and fundamentals of our business but we recognize that we need to continuously raise the bar on execution to address the external business conditions that can change and have changed around us.

And we will take our first quarter from Michael Lasser.", "Michael Lasser - UBS ", "Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to dig a little bit further into the gross margin. The last quarter you got about a 100 basis points of gross margin expansion, it sounds like largely from the deflation element of your retail prices adjusting a little bit more slowly than the wholesale prices. You laid out some factors that restrained that in the quarter like 13 basis points of mix, 14 basis points from freight, you didn\u2019t call out promotions but you made sound like it was slightly less than that amount that would add up to around 40 to 45 basis points. So was there just less of a benefit from the deflation in the second quarter than there was in the first quarter or was there something else going on?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "No, Mike I think I summarized it. The deflation was a little bit less of an impact although it clearly was the largest and then we did benefit from our price optimization and exclusive brands initiatives. So but between clearance which you are correct, it was -- it is relatively modest it was definitely less than 10 basis points and mix and promotion really were the drivers. And when it came to mix, like I had mentioned earlier you had riding lawn mowers which tend to be well below chain average, you also then we were very light in some category that generally are above chain average, some of the key spring categories. So that was the key part of the mix impact and then as consumables continued to increase as a percentage of sales that also caused the mix to be to have an impact. But other than that there was nothing significant relative to the margin.", "Michael Lasser - UBS ", "Okay. And the commentary about the promotions that you laid our during the quarter was very useful and it sounds like you could continue to follow some of that, those tactics, continue to use those tactics moving forward. Is there something that has changed about the customer or are you just digging into customers that are more expensive to attract and that\u2019s why you are having to run the promotions, is there anything different about the competitive environment? And then does that influence your thinking about the long run margin outlook for the business where you have consistently got to do 25 basis points or so of expansion but have quite better than that. Thank you very much.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Michael this is Greg. First of all there is nothing significant that we can see that changed with our customer. They are still being conservative, they are still buying very close to need. What I think we saw was demand shifted later and as demand shifts later a lot of these customer say you know maybe I don\u2019t need to make that investment in x, y and z we clearly saw them not interested this year in some of the outdoor products that in years past that they have performed very well and by the way those are higher margin products that we count on in our second quarter mix. So that\u2019s the first thing. And I think we saw them pull back a little bit from what I\u2019ll discretionary spending on some things. ", "I don\u2019t think there is any competitive pressures that we can see, that have caused any issues. So I would say to that, no haven\u2019t seen anything and I think in general our consumer will look at forward purchasing a little differently. We are already starting to see a good indication on some early reads and early sell-throughs on fall products in certain categories in our business but I won't get specifics from a competitive standpoint, but that is a very strong indication that they are looking forward, aren\u2019t looking back and that's really what we need from them right now. ", "Michael Lasser - UBS ", "Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks again.", "Operator", "", "And we will take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird", "Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird", "", "Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess following up on that a little bit, the inventory looked very well managed in the quarter. Does that limit your ability to capitalize on any extended spring selling season in Q3? And is that why maybe you're being a bit cautious on that or Greg maybe just a comment you just made that your customers are kind of looking forward? ", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Peter, two things. In some categories like some outdoor power equipment there will be a limited availability because either there is model change over or those manufacturing facilities have already moved on to making snow blowers and other type of winter products. So yeah, there will be some limit to that but we're able to grab some inventory before some of those conversions occurred. So I think we're sitting what we want to be with inventory and we think we can maximize what's left to the season.", "Again I think the customers, what we\u2019ve seen initial here is that they\u2019re already looking forward which is a good thing but they're still buying to need. And in some of our regions where we have lot of moisture and heat, some of outdoor park equipment categories have been just extraordinarily strong. ", "And we're basically feeding that business day to day. So mix of things going on right now. Good look at fall forward as well as still trying to capture some of those lost sales from spring. ", "Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, fair enough. So my second question is just on the freight headwind that we saw in the quarter, I mean clearly the Western extension is expected to be a freight headwind here but I guess the in-bound capacity issue would seem somewhat new. So maybe you guys can talk a little bit about that and then whether you expect that persist going forward? Thank you. ", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Peter, Tony when it comes to the inbound freight rate there has been a lot of conversion about some of these incremental costs as far as the truck and availability, driver availability that has increased our cost. We do expect to have going forward and we have taken that in consideration in our forecast. ", "It is somewhat impactful. It does add some basis points to the freight in the impact. But again we believe that we can manage that to that end have included it in our forecast in back half. ", "Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, and then I guess just looking at the back half our gross margin kind of as you had said, kind of flattish to down a little bit in second half and I think you are clearly expecting the fourth quarter to be down given the comparison. Do you also expect that the third quarter gross margin to be down or you think it\u2019s going to be flat, just any color around that given what you're seeing so far? Thank you. ", "Anthony F. Crudele", "", "As we look at the third quarter, we think that the gross profit is going to probably be more in the flattish range. We think that there is obviously more upside in Q3 than in Q4 because we did have such strong sell-through in the fourth quarter. ", "If we can continue to get good spring summer sell-through on some of the higher-margin goods there some potential upside there as well. But again just overall we try to stay away from the specific quarter guidance and try to keep it generic to the back half but we believe that there is a little bit more upside to Q3 than there is to Q4 when it comes to gross margin.

Sandfort", "Good afternoon.

Sandfort", "That's correct, yes.", "David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "And that number is sort of the higher end of the range that you\u2019ve seen overtime, is there something that you're doing differently with these class of stores that's producing a better number?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "There is clearly a lot more research that's going to on before we open these stores because we're going to into new regions David and we\u2019ve spent time out there with the customer base, and our teams here at the store support center with our field people they are replacing out there. So much more focus on understand the consumer before we are out there opening more stores. ", "The second thing and I\u2019ve mentioned this before, we have a team of people here at the store support center that with any new store that opens in its first 12 months of its life there is bit of a, I\u2019ll call it a babysitting period where they really work very closely with that individual store understanding differences and needs, whether it be floor product, depth of product some change outs and planograms maybe some products that we need to introduce in the store because the customer demands so on and so forth. ", "So we spend that first 12 months with that new store trying to get that assortment and that new store positioned in that market before we turn it over and put into the run rate of the normal the rest of the company. So it\u2019s a unique process. It takes time, it takes people but it\u2019s paid big dividends for us.", "David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thanks Greg.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "", "David, just to also clarify on that, as we move west the mix of the store is going to be a little larger. So it\u2019s a larger volume store.", "David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "", "So I should say you see that in a number of sort of increasing as a percentage of sales, total sales of the company or average store. Some of it is just due to the mix of the stores that we are opening.", "David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "Thank Tony. And the secondly you mentioned you got a good book or some look in to the fall product demand and it\u2019s favorable. What products in particular are you looking at to see that?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Well, Dave unfortunately I can\u2019t tell you which categories because from a competitive standpoint, but there are four that are key to our business just as there are three or four to the spring season and there are great indicators of forward look or forward trend and what I can tell with great confidence is we have started off with very, very positive trends and we expect those will continue.", "David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "Great, thanks and good luck.", "Gregory A.

Downing", "", "I think, John, the different in the north-south typically over the last I\u2019d few quarters we have been relatively consistent across all regions but I think we, this time we saw we saw quite differentiation in particular with the northeast in kind of the Mid-Atlantic areas that they did not perform up to the area.", "John Lawrence \u2013 Stephens, Inc.", "And is it fair to say Greg your comments on some of the forward-looking, is it fair to say that those lines have converged and when weather is sort of a parity in both places that they look a lot similar going forward?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "That is correct. And I will say that it echoing what Lee said, you know we still are seeing very consistent traffic and what happened really in the North versus the South was the mix in the basket was so different from a year ago and as the weather is warm in both locations now both parts of the country we are seeing very similar selling patterns, but we are also seeing a nice movement forward in business across the country.

Sandfort", "Good evening Chris.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan", "As you talk about, as you think about really the first seven months of the year it would encouraged us to look at the business in terms of halfs and maybe including the July date is the right way to look at -- what do you think the core underlying trend in the business is, you had some early help from the cold and then it hurt you and then you had this delayed spring but now it seems to be helping you. So what's the right underlying trend in the business?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Well, let me, kind of bracket it for you. The first thing is there have been some comments about volatility but it's really not volatility. This is really I think we can give some great examples of how consistent some things are and the underlying components of the business. Number one, comp store traffic counts, they remain strong. They were very consistent and that's an underlying piece of the core business that the customers are still coming in and making purchases into and other products in store. Second thing the basket, the basket changed quite a bit in the first quarter this year versus a year ago and as the demand increased based upon the warmth of the weather and I hate to use weather but weather did have an impact, it then started to affect how the mix of basket and sales of products were from the stores. So the north and the south look very different in sales for the first five, six months. ", "This was probably some of the most extreme weather, honestly we've ever seen at least for the time I have been with the company. So we dealt with it but it was clearly a shifting of product mix and demand from consumer of certain products based upon the fact that you get out and either in the yards, work in the gardens, do work outside in general. So underlying it's good. Now deflation had some impact, no question. Deflation played a role but I think generally speaking demand shifted later in the north and the upper mid-west and that we saw pretty normalized business in more mid-west than south.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan", "And then as you think about the feed and food category aspects I guess maybe for -- on a unit basis. Is that -- has the growth in that business moderated, has there been much change there? I think some of the dog category it seems like there is some consternation out there on the dog category. But overall as you think about dog and horse has the food and feed category been pretty good for you?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "I can tell you that our unit counts were up in both categories. So we are continuing to take market share.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then, perfect. In the July commentary is it fair to say that July is an unassisted comp and some of the questions focusing on the promotional level here, I think people -- investors were trying to understand that you are driving the business or being forced to drive the business through promotions. Is the July commentary about trend largely in unassisted or unpromoted.", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Yes, Chris, July is a return to more normal but we would expect it would be the performance of tractor supply as we known it. Yeah, we did nothing to further assist the business this is just a good solid trend of business that honestly just came later.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan", "Perfect. Thanks very much.", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets", "Hi guys. I guess everyone\u2019s kind of talking around it but can you give us an idea for how big the difference was between the south and northeast and whether is a range or some other way to think about it?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Yeah. I think when you look at it, I guess we can give you some range but what's interesting is that as we progressed in the quarter, we did start to see the north come back. So as much as we feel that there was little bit of some lost sales there, it did start to moderate some. So when you look across the chain and if you look at it from a full year basis actually the northeast came back very nicely. When you look at some of the range, it's probably somewhere between 300 to 400 basis points of swing between north and the south far as the performance of those regions, when it comes to sort of the spring categories.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets", "Got you, that's very helpful. And then I don't know how you really answer that, I mean Greg you kind of talked about, you didn't really see a change in consumer behavior but obviously there are some people out there thinking that there are significant deflationary forces on some of your core customers with corn et cetera. So maybe if you can just give us some of your thoughts on if that could have some sort of impact on your overall customer base or what's the right way for investors to kind of think about that as a potential impact on the business? Thanks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Well the first thing I would say is that what gives us comfort is the fact that we were having consistent growth in our transaction count at the store. So our customer base continuous to shop with us and it continuous to grow. I would tell you that in many of the products we sell, corn is a very small component. However it\u2019s a good indicator of what can happen with the rest of grains and other mixtures and products in feed and food. ", "We have not seen any shift downward in quality of the product that the customer is buying or them buying any less of and we saw that back in the earlier part of the recession if you remember you have been following the company back in \u201908 we saw customers trading down into lower price feeds and foods, we are not seeing that at all, not seeing at all. As a matter of fact many customers, I think are seeing great value and understanding that, that a better quality feed or food is better for animals. So no indications of that there were some challenges, no question.", "In the early part of the year with weather and being able to run trucks and get product to stores but that was past us so the second quarter really was more of, it was circled around the demand for other seasonal products and the C.U.E. categories are performing very well, we are very pleased with those and we believe because of that traffic count and the unit increases that business is solid.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "", "This is Tony. We have done some analysis in sort of the more rural areas where we would expect the farm income to have an impact and we have not seen any large disparities relative to the performance of the stores in those areas.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets", "Got you, all very helpful.

Sandfort ", "Hi.", "Seth Basham - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "", "Our question really around the consumer and I am trying to understand your concern little bit better. On the one hand you are talking about strength in some big ticket discretionary categories like riding lawn mowers and on the other hand you are talking about more limited behavior or sales in other high margin discretionary things in the spring. How do you juxtapose those things and what do you think the consumer is really thinking right now?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "This is Greg. I think it\u2019s a simple answer. Some of those what I call discretionary purchases are more ornamental and decorative types things and there is a life to those. Typically you buy them early, you kind of use them and they transition from year-to-year. Our customers typically shop on need, so I think because of the delay and their ability to use some of those products, particularly some of outdoor products they may have made some decision to say no I am going to continue to support the things I need and I am going to move on and I\u2019ll look forward to next season. ", "And what we did was when we start seeing that trend we started to moderate our inventory levels in those categories and manage ourselves to a successful conclusion. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s anything unusual particularly given how late the season developed.", "Seth Basham - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, as you think about the gross margin outlook being a little bit limited going forward, are you guys changing your cost control measures to offset that in anyway?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Seth, we have a hard look at the back half and we believe we have a very focused approach around SG&A and that\u2019s why we have adjusted our outlook relative to the SG&A where we believe that we can drive some leverage from SG&A in the back half for the year.", "Seth Basham - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "Anything specific that you can point to?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Well, obviously there is some discretionary spend. There is also some initiatives that we\u2019ve been able to manage more efficiently and some that we discontinued to make sure that we don\u2019t spend ahead of the benefits that we receive from some of the key initiatives and we had been able to manage some of the CapEx spend as well around those projects. So we believe that those are few things that we have done relative to drive some expenses and obviously we are always looking at things like managing labor and some of the key occupancy expenses when it comes to repairs and maintenance but at the same time we want to make sure that we take care of our store base.

Sandfort", "", "Simeon, this is Greg. I would say two things on that. One is, it was moderate as far as impact on sales and moderate impact on margin, so minimum. What we already had as weather started to change we happened to be, I think in the right place at the right time with some of the promotions we had already put into play. And for example by shifting the July fourth piece up a week that just gave us a little bit of more time to understand where is the customer on some of these products", "It typically all you are doing is shifting the business typically earlier sometimes versus extending it out but we tried that to see if we get any kind of comp increase out of it. So it had some effect not a large degree of effect. We're already starting to see some turning of the business in the positive direction and the comps as Tony mentioned were significantly better in June and it continued into July. And July has been a month where we\u2019ve changed nothing. It's been exactly the same and we didn't do anything really significant in the month of June, nothing like going out and dropping another piece of circular or circulation for two to three main customers which would be a normal drop for us.

And then on the feed business you mentioned your units in dog or one of the categories was up, you were probably taking share, can you talk about where you think that's coming from?

Sandfort", "", "Well, a couple of things we have there. We made some significant investments in inventory that we would forecast with our suppliers but we don't buy -- we're not buying the commodity type products, when out there. And the fact that we've been able to build exclusive brands in our company and that's a base of business that we can control from a slow margin and exclusivity standpoint helps us but I\u2019m not in the futures business, don't plan to be. And I think we do a fine job today working that inventory and turning that inventory. We're not having out of stock issues.

So I don't like to use weather as any type of issue but it clearly was driven primarily North and the Coastal side of the Midwest. And that area of the country just didn\u2019t respond until the weather actually warmed and once it did business normalized.

Well at this time a year ago there would have maybe one. ", "The twine business is extremely strong and why is that? Well there forecasted more cutting and things so, there is some unusual things year-to-year either happening but they are delayed and are still coming so, you know our biggest challenge right now is managing trying to gain the maximum return on the inventory we have in those categories and then also transitioning to fall and then I said earlier we are very pleased with we are seeing in some of the early indications of the some of the fall sets in some of the northern region and so you know I feel quite good right now about the mixes inventory how things are selling through but is unusual, this is not a typical year that we wouldn\u2019t be seeing some of the selling of some of these products this late in the season.", "Mark Miller - William Blair & Company", "", "Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then something apart from the weather, on the import purchases up around high single-digit in the first-half. That had been growing a little bit faster than total sales in the past. So I guess can you kind of give us a sense for what is your current outlook for higher penetration of import which are the categories again are you really focusing on and if you think that will star accelerating again or you\u2019re kind of getting closer to where the business can go? Thanks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Mark I have always stated that there is no set numbers for us as far as a target but it will shift between you know seasons this year and we did pull back a little bit on some, I\u2019ll call it import products in the outdoor category and I think it was a good move on merchants\u2019 part because it was a category unfortunately that was soft this year. It wasn\u2019t because of the inventory because the customer just decided that that income was going somewhere else. ", "We still see growth, we still see the machine behind our product development and sourcing piece of the company growing. I still think that we will see, I don\u2019t know it could 300, 400, 500 basis points of more growth as we get into end of the year and in to next year still so there is no slowing of that conversion but I don\u2019t have a target number to give you. I think it would be wrong to say because it\u2019s a totally different mix between the parts of the business, some piece is a higher percentage others low so look for you know continued improvements and increases in the mix.", "Mark Miller - William Blair & Company", "", "That\u2019s helpful, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "", "And we will take our next question from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam Sindler - Deutsche Bank", "", "Yes, good afternoon guys, thank you. So two questions one, sorry both on weather. One, if you remind us what an extended season mean for you guys specifically what it about the weather last year that helped drive double-digit comps in July and August? And then as it relates to the commentary on fall, just wondering if that was concentrated in sort of the Ohio, Michigan, Western New York Pennsylvania areas which did see for whatever reason a very late hold of Vortex over the last couple of weeks the temperatures dropping very well below average just to make sure we're not getting sort of a false lead on that?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Let me address your last piece, there is no false read here. What you got is our consumers last year honestly were caught a little short on a number of categories of products because we had a very what I would gracious long winter. So what we typically have seen in the history of our company is when that happens they start to buy earlier for the next year in an effort not to get caught short and in an effort to make sure that they will start on product. So that's what I think is happening there pulling Vortex aside. As far as the other weather things what you see is extension, ironically this year is -- they are still planting grass seed they are still putting in gardens, they are still cutting hay. There is a number of things that typically would start to be winding down at this time of the year, that are still very vibrant up the Midwest in the coastal areas and the Carolinas and up to the northeast. ", "So that\u2019s going to play itself out for a while and we are still seeing again some forward buying but I like what we're seeing is the reaction to, I'll call it a late spring but they will come a point of time and it will be right around labor day or shortly before that will shift again and we are in great shape to take advantage of that.", "Adam Sindler - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Very good. Thank you. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. What I'm trying to get a handle on is the historical kind of perspective of the promotions you mentioned you\u2019re kind of sprinkling in some promotions which I understand but just remind of the history of that when you done that last and how it kind of developed, if you don't mind.", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Aram we have been doing that for a number of years now and it's not really promotion. What it is store level, I'll call it customer interactions, whether we would do a farmers market on a weekend in a group of stores in a certain part of the country or we would have a pet swap meet or something. I mean it's all kind of interesting things that our marketing department has researched and developed and they are really local store events that we give the stores the opportunity to execute to and we actually put together a marketing package for them that\u2019s done at the store. ", "So understand it's not about more promotion and it's not about on sale. This is we are an everyday price value company and that's how customers have come to trust us on pricing. So these are events that draw customers to the store they are primarily geared on the weekends and there is really a menu of things that they can use and we usually give them some guidance but we've been doing this for a number of years now.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC", "And maybe just last question is we are trying to rebound to get back to normal which is kind of let\u2019s say 3.5 or 4 something maybe for the back half and in years past doing the 3.5 and the 4 wouldn't have kind of passed muster because you were comping up six, sevens and eight. I'm just wondering kind of the new normal kind of 3 to 4 and what can you do to get back to the old normal, because those were even better still?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Great question, not a simple answer. You know some of the things that I am encouraged about is that we are continuing to find new products and able to take some businesses that we thought had cycled through and were kind of mature and actually breathe some new life into them. We talked a little bit early about the safe business. That business was running hot for a number of years and we knew it's going to soften at some point. So it's one of those things when you look at those businesses and you say how do you offset that, how you continue to grow it well. ", "Sometimes if a pie gets smaller you have to go and look at how to get more of that pie. But I think in general we are going to continue to do the things that we think we do best and that is introduce new products, use in store events and things to bring customers through, introduce them to new products, make sure we\u2019re in stock and watch those in stock levels and make those investments and really look at maximizing probably three or four key categories each season where we believe we have a dominant position. ", "You know we've learned that we get behind some of these categories from a merchandise presentation and branding and promotion level we can drive the business and I think we can do it at healthy margin. So there is more for us to do, unfortunately we have seen a little bit of some weather challenges that have gotten in the way but I believe we\u2019ll get back to being the Tractor you know here shortly.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Thanks, I hope so, bye.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll take our next question Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.", "Jon Berg - Piper Jaffray", "", "Great, thanks for taking our question. This is actually Jon Berg on for Pete tonight. It sounds like you guys have talked about corn being you know a deflation kind of indicator on the business and just curious about what you have seen with oil and steel in your business so far this year and how you are looking at those categories for the second half?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "", "Jon, this is Tony. The big driver as far as our adjustment to deflation is really corn prices. When we look at the other two factors which is oil and scraps steel are the other two indicators for our business. We did see some flattening out when it came to oil. But as we look at the back half of the year we don\u2019t believe that those two indicators will be a significant driver of the deflation/inflation in the back half.", "Jon Berg - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, great. And then just quickly a second question. When did the softness in the safe category really start to set in and I mean how long do you anticipate that core category being a headwind?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Right the safe category has really been a headwind just the last two quarters so really 2014 and obviously the big driver has been some of the gun control issues that are there, especially the when it surfaced after Sandy Hook. So last year was very, very strong gun safe sales year and again most retailers have talked about that, especially in the sporting goods area about the softness of the industry.", "Jon Berg - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot and good luck in the second-half.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "And we will take our next question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "", "You spoke briefly on the west stores and the relative size and sales volume. Curious if you can talk a bit about the margin experience at this point and what you think as you forward as you open more stores out there specifically on the gross margin opportunity, what you are seeing and learning from those stores? ", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "As we move west obviously we like the sales volume of those stores. As we talked in the past the real estate cost are more expensive. So from a modeling standpoint they fit into our model, from an economic standpoint. What we see in the gross margin side it\u2019s going to vary slightly but we do like what we see from a gross margin perspective. Those territories that are a little competitive obviously are going to be much stronger. Some of that gross margin that we -- that is above chain average can be eaten up a little by the additional freight. So as we eventually get our distribution center out there at the end of 2015, hopefully some of that freight degradation will moderate some. ", "So net-net we really like what we see out there from a sales standpoint and from a gross margin standpoint and we believe there will be a very profitable segment of the business?", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "From a mix, I understand the comments from competition, from a mix of what you are selling there and I suppose competition is well when the smoke clears and the infrastructure is there to supply those stores, is that likely to be a similar, better or worse gross margin relative to the existing business?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I think net it will be a better gross margin business.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "", "And then secondly, as it relates to -- Greg I understood the comments on some of the marketing things you have done with promotions and connecting with customers, but from a merchandising standpoint, curious if there is anything new or incremental either specifically or strategically that you are doing, merchandising to help grow the sales as we look out this year and in to next year if there is anything changing materially there that you can speak to?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Eric, there are number of things that we are doing differently but again I am reluctant to speak to in specific terms but I can tell you this that we still drive a lot newness into our stores that\u2019s how we learn really where our customer is headed. They give us great indication very early on. So the testing programs are still robust and you will see as you travel our stores you will be able to tell where the focus is at. There is no question, you will see the investment behind inventory, you will see it in some of the promotions that we will run out there in print and online. So I would say to you that the pipeline is still full of new initiatives and new products and we continue to learn from the web business which is interesting there is some things that the web is teaching us about demand and about some products even in some price tiers that we can sell on the web and we are now are feeling that we can sell in store. So both are working nicely in tandem.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good afternoon. This is [Omera] on for Matt. You had previously mentioned a high level of moisture on the ground which is traditionally a tailwind to sale. Is that moisture still on the ground and then is it a potential benefit in Q3 and does that benefit sort of disappear when we get in around this time of the year?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Well traditionally we start seeing -- if you look at the -- we look at weather maps and we look at those forecasts and what we've seen is that this year in the Southwest and as we go to the Midwest and that no question that more moistures drive broader sales, it drives weed control and bug infestations and all those types of things. So those businesses still have a little bit of running room. But we haven't seen any kind moisture in those areas for a while. We've typically seen the maps showing a lot of drought. So that helped us this year a bit in the south and the southwest. I don't think it's going to give us any great benefit in third quarter. I think it's more you know in the second quarter obviously will benefit from that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Joseph Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group", "Hi guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you know I know you talked a lot about marketing promotion and the cadence and I apologize if I missed this during the call but any update on an Affinity type program I know you guys don't want to give away anything we've talked about that in the past, but just any, anything new on that front because I know you\u2019ve talked about testing different things on the Affinity side?", "Gregory A. Sandfort ", "Yeah. You are correct. We are still in the testing modes and we are, I would say developing a position now on what we believe will work tractor supply. It is not an additional discount type program as many of these programs turn out to be. This is different and we will be able to tell you more about that as the year progresses.", "Joseph Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group", "", "That's great. And then I wanted to go back to something I think a question or two ago you had brought up some comments about learning some things from the web and online sales and I guess I kind of wanted to broaden that out to like are you seeing anything shifting towards the web because I think there is this general view out there and certainly we have it that your business is somewhat defensive against the internet and I am wondering if you've seen any shifts in the business model that may suggest there is categories that do lend itself to e-commerce and maybe not a threat from Amazon but at least maybe more benefit for you to sell via the web?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I think generally speaking because we continue to see footsteps and traffic being very consistent in the store, what happens for us is the web becomes a facilitator and people use it for research. There are some products we are learning though that we can sell on the web and I'll give example of one, chicken coops. Now you may say that it's kind of a silly category to talk about but we can sell very high end coops on the web and much larger scale coops on the web than we can even sell from and really facilitate our presentation in our stores for. And that was an category that to be honest with you we weren\u2019t sure that it was going to work as well as it did. It\u2019s been terrific. ", "I also say to you that the web also teaches us a little bit about price transparency and when it comes to things like a [drill] that's not going to be a category, I am going to spend a lot of time and money on because honestly that drill is out there from everybody at a price. But I will have it and I will have an assortment so that my customer sort of meets their needs but what I will find is other products in other categories are things that are unique to me that I can offer my customer around that can\u2019t be found on the website or if it is you have to search multiple places to find it. But our whole focus is to use that web piece as an extension of the stores and to use it as a piece of communication as well as to drive commerce and we are very pleased with the progress we are seeing there and what it is again, there is some teaching going in forth between both of those groups, the store level group and the web group on how to manage some of our businesses and what we can sell. ", "Joseph Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks and have a good quarter guys.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time I will turn the conference back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Yeah, this concludes our second quarter earnings call.

On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and CFO; Steve Barbarick, our EVP of Merchandising and Marketing; and Lee Downing, our EVP of Store Operations and Real Estate.", "The team here at Tractor Supply delivered a solid third quarter performance and we are very pleased with our results. Sale was strong across the board and benefited from an extended spring/summer selling season and the early sales of fall/cold weather products.", "Our business performed consistently from month-to-month and region to region with each of the regions delivering mid-single-digit comp increases for the quarter. Comparable store sales increased 5.6% versus an increase of 7.5% in the last year\u2019s third quarter, which was our most difficult quarterly comparison for the year. The comp increase was driven by a strong performance in both traffic and ticket. Comp store transaction count increased 3.3% and average ticket increased 2.2%. This represents our 26th consecutive quarter of positive comp transaction counts.", "Now, with the delayed beginning of the spring selling season in many of our markets this year, I felt the team did a terrific job managing product assortments and inventory levels to capitalize on the shift in the weather. We experienced strong sell-throughs of seasonal categories such as lawn and garden supplies, live goods, outdoor power equipment, fencing and agricultural chemicals for the quarter.", "We also saw strength on the left hand side of our store in categories such as hardware, truck and tool. Now we updated a number of these plan-o-grams during the earlier part of the year and these changes clearly contributed to our increase in comparable store sales. And also big ticket sales increased for the quarter, driven by both late summer and early fall seasonal product sales in such categories as outdoor power equipment and heating.", "Based on our experience that a cold extended winter season like we had earlier this year can result in early fall buying. We delivered our heating and cold weather items earlier this year and we experienced a solid sales response from our customers without any additional major promotions to our exiting event calendar.", "Now, there were a number of other achievement in the quarter and let me highlight those. Our annual Pet Appreciation Week or P.A.W event as we call it, occurred in the third quarter again this year, and we again experienced a great response. And just as a reminder for those of you who are not familiar with this, this is a week-long event that promotes pet adoption and pet health awareness. We partner with local pet adoption agencies and community groups to promote pet adoptions and we offer exceptional values on pet products throughout all our stores. Year-after-year the P.A.W event continues to position us an authority for pet food and pet care.", "The opening of our new store support center on-time and on-budget was another highlight. The new building which was designed to be lead certified consolidated our three previous store support center locations into one facility, bringing all of our dedicated team members into a single campus setting. Deferred from the new store support center, we also opened our new plan-o-gram facility which we call our merchandised innovation center or MIC. This now give us the ability to review, analyze, and approve multiple plan-o-grams and floor sets in a full sized store environment before the proposed rollout to our stores. This will also prove to be a big time saver for our merchant and digital display teams.", "Now turning to the fourth quarter, we plan to open our first Tractor Supply store in Utah, which will be the 49th state for Tractor Supply and we recently opened our first Tractor Supply store in the State of Washington and we\u2019re excited about the opportunity to grow our market share in the Washington markets as we introduce Tractor Supply store as a format to our loyal customers. Additionally, we continue to remain very pleased with the overall performance of all our new stores that are opening in the West.", "Now in late 2015, we will open a new distribution center to support store growth in the West and the Southwest regions and while we have not announced the exact location yet, we\u2019re in the process of finalizing the agreements and acquiring the land for the new building and we expect to be in a position to provide more information shortly. We also recently leased a second distribution facility in Hagerstown, Maryland and we plan to be shipping products in this facility in early 2015. This new facility will support our continued plans for growth in the Northeast.", "And finally, in mid November, we plan to open two HomeTown Pet stores near our store support center here in Brentwood, Tennessee. HomeTown Pet is a new and unique pet supply store that will offer high quality products and services in inviting and welcoming atmosphere for a large variety of pets and animals including dogs, cats, poultry, wild bird, horses and more.", "With our test and learn philosophy as a company, we believe these two stores will serve as great vehicles for us to improve our customer insights and product selections in the local markets we served. And as you know, pet has been a growing and important category for Tractor Supply for some time and we think these stores will help us to further develop our pet business. We have not determined our future expansion plans for this concept, but we\u2019ll apply the initial earnings back into our Tractor Supply stores to grow our sales.", "Tractor Supply sells products that people need and use every day. Our goal is to sell these products at great prices, keep them in stock and make it very easy for our customers to shop in our stores. Customers trust us to have what they need and when they need it. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s relatively cool in May or usually warm in November. It\u2019s our job to anticipate these needs so they have to merchandise our customers\u2019 want.", "Improved tools in analytic scenarios such as price management, demand planning and inventory allocation will help us meet our customers\u2019 needs and we believe by doing so this will benefit our sales and margin growth over the long-term.", "In closing, I\u2019d like to thank all of our dedicated team members out there who work so hard to meet our customers\u2019 needs each and every day. Whether it be in our stores, distribution centers or at the Store Support Center, they delivered a strong third quarter, and we as a company continue to believe that the underlying trends and fundaments of our business are solid. We all know that retailing is a challenging, but exciting business that is always changing and I believe we have the right people and tools in place to deliver long-term growth and shareholder value creation for many years to come.", "We appreciate your time today. And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tony for additional commentary on the third quarter financials and our full year outlook. Tony?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 27, 2014 on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 12.6% to $1.36 billion. Net income grew by approximately 18.3% to $76.6 million or $0.55 per diluted share.", "Comparable store sales increased 5.6% for the third quarter, compared to last year\u2019s increase of 7.5%. Similar to last year, we experienced a late spring as ground moisture and mild temperatures extended the spring selling season, resulting in strong sales and favorable seasonal sell-through. The animal and pet category continued to perform well with solid comps despite deflationary pressures.", "Seasonal categories such as gardening and live goods, outdoor recreation, fencing, riding lawn mowers and repair, all performed very well. Additionally, the third quarter sales benefitted from early fall/winter purchases as the cooler weather later in the quarter served as a reminder of last year\u2019s harsh winter.", "Comp transaction count increased for the 26th consecutive quarter, gaining 3.3% on top of a 6.7% increase last year. Comparable transactions were driven by continued strength of consumable, usable and edible products and the strong performance of the seasonal categories. Average comp ticket increased 2.2% compared to last year\u2019s 0.8%. The increase was driven by the mix of goods and the strength of big ticket sales, partially offset by deflation.", "A few key points about the quarter, we had a solid comp sales trend in July and August against a very tough sale comparison from last year, and we also had a similar late spring. Comp sales were relatively consistent throughout the quarter with all three months having positive mid-single digit comp sales. All regions performed well, as both the north and south benefitted from the extended spring season and the north in particular benefited from the early fall seasonal sales.", "Taking out the positive impact on the average ticket, as the overall big ticket comp was about chain average and big ticket transaction account remains consistent as a percent of the total sales. Strength in our seasonal categories such as outdoor power equipment drove the positive big ticket comp sales increase, despite the continued headwind in the safe category. Depletion was approximately 90 basis points. Last year\u2019s third quarter had approximately 100 basis points of inflation, a swing of 190 basis points.", "Turning now to gross margin, which declined 29 basis points, our initial direct margin improved as a result of our initiatives around price management and strategic sourcing. Import purchases in the quarter increased 26.9% and represented 11.4% of the sales mix. Also exclusive brand sales increased 13.2% compared to last year\u2019s Q3 and were approximately 30.7% of sales. Deflation was the most significant favorable factor impacting margin. As we focus on maintaining margin dollars per unit, this typically will result in an improvement in gross margin rate in deflationary period.", "Offsetting the benefit from deflation and our margin enhancing initiatives was merchandise mix which we estimate had a negative impact of approximately 12 basis points. The mix impact resulted from the strength in sales in live goods, power equipment and the heating categories, which all have lower than chain average margin and had solid year-over-year increases. Freight increased approximately 23 basis points as we had higher transportation costs from the mix of merchandise in the quarter and the increase in stem miles to new western store base. As Greg had mentioned, our promotional cadence was similar to last year and had only a slight negative impact on margin.", "For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 25.2% of sales, an improvement of 84 basis points over the prior quarter. We were pleased with our expense control in the quarter, which coupled with a strong comp sales provided significant leverage. Incentive compensation had a favorable impact on the expense leverage and represented over a third of the leverage benefit. The prior year quarter had a substantial bonus accrual based on the strength of that quarter relative to the full year.", "Additionally, we saw employee medical and workers comp expense moderate from Q2 levels and was more in line with our expectations. This leverage was achieved despite incurring the majority of our new store support center transition costs, which included lease write-offs for two properties. We estimate that this had a drag on the P&L of approximately $0.01. Our effective income tax rate in Q3 was 37%, compared to 36.1% last year. The rate was consistent with our expectation. The year-over-year increase was due principally to the reduction in the federal [WOTC] (ph) tax credit.", "Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of Q3 we had cash balance of $48 million, compared to $46 million last year. We had an outstanding short-term debt of the $150 million, compared to $40 million last year. As we had a higher fall seasonal inventory build at the end of the quarter, and made significant purchases in our stock repurchase program during the quarter.", "During the third quarter under our stock repurchase program we acquired approximately 1,574,000 shares for a total of $97.4 million. We estimate that the share repurchase program did not have a material impact on the EPS for the quarter. Average inventory levels to store at quarter end were 3.7% higher than last year. While annualized inventory turns increased by nine basis points for the quarter. We are pleased with the productivity inventory during the quarter, as the team did an excellent job allocating inventory to key categories and making sure we restocked for the extended spring season.", "Additionally, we brought several key fall winter categories in early and are well prepared for the upcoming season. As result of the prolonged spring season we do not have significant markdown exposure as we move into the fourth quarter.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $43.3 million, compared to $58.2 million last year. We opened 30 stores this quarter, compared to 23 stores in the third quarter of 2013. The decrease in capital expenditure relate to cycling expenditures over the construction of our Southeast distribution center last year.", "Turning to our outlook, based upon the third quarter results, the company has increased its fiscal 2014 guidance from the low end of the previously provided ranges to the high end of the ranges, which were net sales of $5.62 billion to $5.7 billion, comparable store sales of 2.5% to 4% and net income of $2.54 to $2.62 per diluted share. We have reduced our estimates of capital expenditures to range between $190 million to $200 million as we have better visibility to the timing of some of our larger projects such as the Southwest distribution center, and our Northeast distribution center expansion project. And we do not anticipate any purchases of leased stores in the fourth quarter.", "Although some of these projects will move into 2015, we will not raise our target of $215 million of CapEx in 2015 which is consistent with our capital expenditure long term plan.", "New store pipeline is tracking to our full year goal of 102 to 106 new stores. Based on the volume of our share repurchase year-to-date, we believe that our year-end cash balance will be about $25 million to $50 million compared to our previously stated target of $100 million to $150 million. We\u2019re also adjusting our estimate for full year diluted shares outstanding to approximately 139.5 million.", "In the fourth quarter, we now expect deflation to moderate down just slightly from the Q3 levels in range between 60 basis points and 90 basis points. This would put deflation at the high end of our original full year guidance of flat to 100 basis points. We expect gross margin to be down slightly in fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter is our toughest quarterly comparison due to the strong seasonal sell through and minimal markdowns last year. We expect to have continued freight and mix headwinds to offset some of the benefits of our key gross margin initiatives.", "We have been very disciplined in our management of SG&A expense in the back half of the year and we expect to leverage SG&A in the fourth quarter. We have begun to cycle some of the investments we\u2019ve made in the back half of last year making the comparisons a little easier. We forecast that our effective tax rate for the full year will be approximately 37% consistent with our previous guidance.", "Although I will provide full guidance year end conference call consistent with our past practices, I wanted to highlight some of the larger capital projects and incremental expenses for 2015. The construction of our Southwest Distribution Center and the related pre-opening expenses, expansion of the capabilities of our Northeast distribution facility by adding additional lease base close to the current facility in the first quarter of next year, the building of two to three mixing centers next year, system improvements in our omni channel platform, enhanced IT security and demand planning and forecasting tools, higher transportation cost from additional stem miles resulting from our continued expansion in the west.", "Over the past two years, the company has invested in many initiatives to position itself for long term growth. We have managed the business and related investment spending to absorb these costs in our financial model, while delivering strong bottom line growth. Therefore, as we continue to invest in the long term growth of the company, our goal is to execute these incremental investments, such as those I just mentioned, while managing the financial impact to enable us to deliver against our annual EPS target of mid-teens growth.", "To conclude, we are very pleased with our results and execution in the third quarter. We believe that we took advantage of the extended spring summer selling season and well positioned to finish the year strong and deliver another solid growth year.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.", "Peter S. Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Good job and thanks for the color on the call. That was helpful. First Greg for you I know you said that the performance of the stores across the region is pretty consistent, that\u2019s obviously encouraging to hear. Can you take down a little bit into that though? There\u2019s some fear out there about ag related markets? Can you talk about, so that they agree that you guys look at that, how those specific markets perform? Are you seeing any kind of stress in those markets?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Hi Peter it\u2019s Greg. I will give you a brief comment, let Lee comment, as well. We are not seeing any real difference in the business in the upper Midwest and the Midwest, where you just mentioned a lot of these quote fears of the ag-business being difficult have occurred. Our business was very consistent across those regions, as well as it was in the south, the north and the west. So no we\u2019re not seeing any real impact.", "Lee do you have anything to say?", "Lee J. Downing", "Peter up the Midwest the issue out there is Europe in the north, so you could imagine you got the most of the late spring season in that area and you also would have got a little more of the early winter season. So that kind of held that area up. So I agree with you Greg, I think, we had a good even keel across all regions including the Midwest.", "Peter S. Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay thank you. And then as you talk about new store productivity, it looked good again. Just curious comment, I know you\u2019re pleased with what\u2019s going on so far in the west. But what kind of competitive response are you seeing from the competitors as you move into these markets, anything worth calling out?", "", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Peter we haven\u2019t seen anything out west that would indicate that they are really reacting. Their prices have kind of stayed where they are and we are entering the market. People seem to like where we are and where we would join the business.", "Peter S. Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay great, last one for Tony. Just the decline in fuel cost or gas prices that we\u2019ve seen here in recent months, should we think of that as being a potential positive on the freight front going forward? Help us understand how it works through the P&L over the next few quarters. Thank you.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "We definitely had a positive but it was not significant relative to the total transportation expense. We are optimistic that go forward, that it will prove to be a tail wind. But at the same time we are concerned that there will be some additional transportation cost that we\u2019re going to have to manage. But for the most part we believe that it can be served as a positive as we move forward.", "Peter S. Benedict \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Magee with SunTrust.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Hey, guys, this is Linda in for David. Just in regard to the new stores out West, since they\u2019re a little bit larger, just how is the new store productivity performing out there? Is it in line with the company, a little bit higher?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "This is Tony. Depending on how you measure the productivity, from a sales perspective they are much stronger sales stores than the average stores and we really like the volume that we get from the stores out West. Obviously, the expense structure is a little bit heavier as well, but net-net from a long-term return perspective, they are at or slightly above our normal approval rate.", "Unidentified Analyst", "What about on the per foot basis? Would you say\u2026", "", "Anthony F. Crudele", "On a per foot basis, they are not significantly larger on a square foot basis. So the incremental sales, obviously, makes them more productive.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Is e-commerce growing at the rate you\u2019d expect?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I\u2019ll answer that. This is Greg. Our e-commerce business is very robust right now. It\u2019s still very small and we have some more investment spending in the early part of 2015 to really get the platform where we\u2019d like it. And then we believe it will really start to accelerate. So it is running well ahead of the comps that the overall company is running, but it\u2019s still at a very small contribution rate, but we like what we see, all the enhancements we\u2019ve given. That pieces of business so far are working and we just have a few more things to dial-in. And then I think by the early part of next year, we\u2019re going to start to see this thing really start to ramp.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then just lastly, how would you guys prefer winter to play out? What would be the best scenario?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "", "Well, I\u2019ll take that one. Certainly cooler weather really bodes well. You heard Greg talk a little bit about some early cool season weather impacting Q3. I will tell you credit to the team. We talked about getting products in early. We made some strategic investments in inventory and that\u2019s paid off for us. We\u2019d like to see it stay cool and quite frankly heating is a good business for us. We saw lot of wear in apparel. So I would say the colder the better.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. Thank you", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.", "Michael Lasser \u2013 UBS Securities", "Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So first, Tony, I wanted to follow-up on the comment you made towards the end of your remarks about making investments while still maintaining the mid-teens earnings growth. This year at the high end of the range, if you hit it, you are going to grow earnings maybe 13%. We could argue whether that\u2019s mid-teens or not, but the suggestion would be that this year would be an aberration out of the mid-teens earnings growth but even if you make a similar number of investments next year we should expect similar to better growth rate is that fair?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes, I guess we could argue a little bit as to whether 13% was considered to be mid-teens but the comment represents that we know that we are a growth company, we know that to continue to grow we need to make investments in the business. We believe it that those investments have been included in our modeling. The last two years, we\u2019ve talked about the last two years being investment years. We think that now that it\u2019s sort of embedded in our model go forward that we can continue to grow the company in mid-teens and be able to continue to make those type of investments to build out our infrastructure.", "There just always seems to be concerns that every year is going to be an investment year and we need to chase something for earnings and we believe as we go forward that this already embedded in our modeling and that we can deliver our long term target. Having that said, as in the past we have always talked about growing the chain at 8% having some comp sales increase looking at 25 basis points of EBIT margin improvement with the share repurchase we think that we can get to the mid-teens well.", "Michael Lasser \u2013 UBS Securities", "Okay. And my follow-up is on the gross margin, you outlined freight was up 23, mix was up 12, so without 35 basis points your gross margin was down 28, you should have seen a little bit of benefit from deflation you\u2019ve outlined all the factors that are margin driver that are, that they use continue to benefit from. So is there something else going on I know Greg mentioned that. Promotions were really part of the picture this quarter at least throughout most of the quarter. Is there something else going on? And then as part of that should we expect to see gross margin accelerate overtime as you build out more distribution centers and you\u2019re going to in turn lower the numbers 10 miles that that you have?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "That clearly is one objective that we have as far as using the distribution network when it comes to the gross profit drivers, I try to highlight some of the larger impacts. When you look at all the variables involved in looking at gross profit, there is probably about 10 or 15 different levers. There\u2019s shrink. I think it was slightly down \u2013 well it\u2019s slightly up this period. There are special events that we have. There are vendor funded programs that have impacts. The marketing and the benefits of the programs that we have in place may impact margin in certain ways.", "So what we\u2019re trying to communicate relative to the marketing was that, we did not have significant numbers of programs out there that we\u2019re trying to buy the sales. We feel that it was a very normal year for us from a marketing standpoint. So when you look at some of the other factors, there were some other negatives that brought it down as an offset. But the two that I mentioned between mix and freight, those are the largest drives and we believe that that those go forward are sort of the key headwinds that we\u2019re going to be facing. So obviously with our initiatives to drive EBIT margin performance either through gross margin or SG&A leverage, we want to try to deliver that 25 basis points of improvement each year.", "Michael Lasser \u2013 UBS Securities", "Okay that\u2019s helpful. Let me speak one last to you. Greg, there is a lot of discussion on the commodity price complex and grain prices and the potential impact that it could have on your customer base, that\u2019s probably anyone\u2019s guess and at least your performance would suggest that it\u2019s not have an impact, but does that have any impact on the way you\u2019re running the business? Are you thinking about changing up the product mix if corn stays at $3 to $4 a bushel for an extended period of time? Does that influence in any ways, the shape or manner in which you run the business? And I\u2019ll turn over from there. Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "All right, Michael, I\u2019m going to let Steve to address this but I would tell you that it would not change the way that we run the mix of the business because we are a needs-based company. There are certain things our customers need, but I think Steve wanted to give some highlights on that.", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes I\u2019ll tell you Michael, you can look at it being deflationary and yes there may be some top line headwinds, but we\u2019re still continuing to see unit growth. And for the way I sit back and I look at it is there\u2019s a lot of folks have an opportunity now to get into animal ownership where they may have not done so before. So whether it would be getting into bird feeding, when it comes to a lot of bird products that we sell on the seed side, whether it would be herd size. We\u2019ve seen a decline over time in herd size, you may see that come back. So I don\u2019t necessarily see deflation in some of these commodities as a bad thing. If anything it\u2019s putting money back into the pockets of folks that we\u2019re spending a lot more on it. So I think there\u2019s two different ways to look at that and I tend to look at it from that perspective.", "Operator", "And as a reminder please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We\u2019ll take our next question from John Lawrence with Stephens.", "John R. Lawrence \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Yes, good afternoon guys.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Hi, John.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Good afternoon, John.", "John R. Lawrence \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Steve, just following on a mix issue, can you talk a little bit about you mentioned some of the positive surprises from the test or a good sell-through on the left hand side of the store. Can you tell us what really worked there and what you\u2019re excited about?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "It\u2019s interesting John, we talk a little bit about deflation and overcoming some of the top line headwinds that that might cause and we experienced some of that in the last couple of quarters. The team did a really nice job looking out working with our store operations partners, we updated the plan-o-grams, we did a number of resets and not get into too much specifics but the departments where we have product in line every single department had a positive comp store sales performance and I have not seen that long time with Tractor Supply Company. The team has really worked hard. We work with the vendor partners, we switched out some product lines, I would tell you I feel very, very good about the strength of that side of the business. We just not need to keep the momentum going.", "John R. Lawrence \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Great, thanks. And just another, you mentioned a little bit more on the mixing centers for next year, Greg can you comment a little bit more about the thought process on that and where we stand and what you\u2019re seeing out of that.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Yeah, the mixing center concept is really an attempt on our part to replenish the stores in a more rapid response methodology. Just I would call it on high bulk, high velocity low value product and it also take some steps out of us moving the product to distance from the manufacturer all the way to the DC and back to the stores.", "Mixing center system between all of that and deals with full palletized high velocity, high bulk products that we can push the stores daily every other day once a week \u2013 it really depends upon the need but to help cut down on stem miles at the same time though be able to pull inventory back out of the store from the standpoint that we were putting week to 10 days with the supply in the background of these types of products because we only have once or twice a week delivery. The mixing centers will help us push that inventory to those stores as they\u2019re selling it. So we think it will speed our term, we think overall will bring our inventory levels down over time and again keep us in better stock position.", "So we got two facilities that we will have operational in 2015. We\u2019re moving out of the back to the vehicle DC with the one facility and we\u2019ll be switching off another facility that will be a free stand post to that distribution network. And we\u2019re excited about the idea of it and we believe that it will serve us well but we tested the process and wake over the last year it worked, now we\u2019re going into two free stand units and see how that operates, if that works all will be thank, we\u2019ll take it out to more.", "John R. Lawrence \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Great, congrats. Good luck in the fall.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you, John.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research", "", "Good afternoon everyone. Nice quarter.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thanks, Chuck.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Tony, could you just repeat one number before I ask my question. You said what private label or corporate brand was as a percent of sales.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Yes, I can give you that number. It was 30.7%.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research", "All right. Thank you. It sounds like most categories did well. Is there anything you\u2019d like to point out that was a little weak in terms of the merchandise categories? And what kind of headwind will it face this quarter?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "", "Overall like the regional performances, we saw pretty consistent strength across the board on the merchandizing side. I will say that we continue to face some headwinds when it comes to safes and storage. We saw that the last couple of quarters. We continue to see that in Q3. We\u2019re doing a lot to offset that, but that\u2019s where I would say some of the softness was.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Okay. Any other retail R&D going on besides HomeTown Pet?", "", "Anthony F. Crudele", "", "Well, Chuck, we\u2019re always trying and testing new ideas, but I would say no. There\u2019s no other large scale thing in relative respect to what you heard from us about HomeTown Pet. But any given time you\u2019ll be in our stores and you\u2019ll see us testing 60 to 70 different ideas throughout the chain. So that\u2019s the test-and-learn mentality that we have.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research", "All right. Thank you.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks, good evening. So a couple of questions. Can you talk about your thoughts on deflation next year and how that might proceed throughout the year? You\u2019re starting to lap the deflation in the fourth quarter here. Obviously, corn prices are way down. So any thoughts there would be very helpful.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Sure. Chris, this is Tony. When it comes to our estimates of deflation, we really do it sort of as a spot calculation and look as to where we are today and compare it to the upcoming quarters or the upcoming year. So I would prefer to push that calculation out until we come through to our next conference call and give the full year guidance. But in general terms, we do expect to experience some deflation next year. And as much as we do see some of the prices decreasing in some of the corn categories, we were hopeful that it will moderate somewhat over what we experienced this year.", "Christopher Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yes, understand. I mean the comparisons pretty much are straight lined over the next four quarters. And then there has been a lot of discussion in the investment community around the correlation to forming income line. I know you mentioned specifically that all regions comp in the mid single digit range, but can you talk about any evidence in either direction to support or refuse that argument?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes. This is Greg. The only evidence I can give you is our performance. It is totally inconsistent with what has been stated out there and I think it\u2019s overplayed, that form income has a direct correlation to our business. We can\u2019t see it. We\u2019ve been watching it for years, it has a slight if any impact. So I think our third quarter performance kind of stands out as a factor that would say that it is not anything that is co-related to our business.", "Christopher Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay understood. And then the last question is DC investments next year. Last year, you had a DC opening that caused some margin pressures. You have a couple of things going on in the west, in the northeast. So any thoughts there in terms of maybe how these DC openings compare to the one that you did in 2013? Thanks.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "", "Sure, Tony, again. Last year was a little bit different because last year\u2019s distribution center in the southeast was a relocation. So we incurred probably more cost than opening up a new one because we had a team, we had to relocate, we had some exit cost on the lease. And so there was more transitions cost required.", "Also as we move into next year and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t give specifics as to any numbers and what we are laughing this year versus next year but we obviously have the relocation of the store support center. As we move into the distribution center next year, what\u2019s different is we would expect to have a decrease in the stem miles and obviously have a benefit in transportation. And so the only thing that would hold us back next year that will be incremental would be the pre-opening related to the distribution center. Other than that, once it opened and it gets to full capacity, it\u2019s the transportation benefit should offset the additional cost.", "So we do expect to have some pre-opening related to that facility but again we believe that over the last two years we have incorporated those type of expenses into our operating model and continue to deliver our EPS target despite some of the additional infrastructure build that we\u2019ll have.", "Christopher Horvers \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.", "Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Hi, guys Scot Ciccarelli. Another follow up on the plan-o-grams and reset, can you give us a specific example of some changes you\u2019ve made. So if we can fair understand why customers had the positive reaction as they did, and could that lead to further reset in the store given the success of the initiative?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes, absolutely. First of all, we\u2019re always looking to do different resets and adjusting and modifying our product assortments based on customer demand and trend. But when you look at the left hand side I will use just I will give you just one example.", "We were looking at the performance of cargo management and we\u2019ve got an emphatic system and we talk a lot about the systems that we use today and how the refining done. And it suggested that our profitability per square foot wasn\u2019t real strong and so we looked across that what opportunities we might see and we see an opportunity for example winch set. So we reduced cargo management by four feet, added that four feet on to the winch program and we\u2019ve seen the numbers just exceed our expectations in a pretty significant way.", "You could take that bit of learning right there and apply that across a lot of different areas and we have done that on the left hand side. In addition to that I would tell you we have done a better job refining our assortments both locally like we\u2019ve talked a lot about in the past and then we taken the inventory and replayed it back to markets where we think that there is more investment, where there is more demand. So again credit to the team working collaboratively as an organization, we really pulled off some nice things and it should give us a tailwind for another quarter or so.", "Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "That\u2019s very helpful. And then just a follow-up. It\u2019s actually a balance sheet question, your payables inventory were actually up a bit this quarter. I\u2019ve always thought, given the leverage you guys should have with your vendors given how big you are in the space, that\u2019s something that could continue to rise overtime. I would think you\u2019ll able to take our working capital out overtime. Tony or Greg, can you just kind of give us your perspective on that? Thank a lot.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Sure, Scott. This is an area where we clearly would like to focus little bit more. We believe that as we work with our vendors that we look at the entire relationship and so when we look at the type of terms that we are going to get as far as sort of finance inventory versus the cost of the goods and the other programs that they work with us on. It\u2019s been an area where we believe that we come up with sort of the best working relationship with the vendors. Having said that, it\u2019s definitely as we move forward it\u2019s an area that we will continue to focus on as far as driving that. Over the last couple of years, we have used our financing ability to provide anticipation for our vendors when they needed to cash infusions and so we\u2019ve utilized that.", "So generally as we came out of the recession, that\u2019s one of the reasons why that number sort of had continued to drop down, but as businesses improved, obviously it\u2019s an area that we will take a hard look at.", "Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. Thanks a lot guys.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Chandni Luthra \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "", "Hi, guys, this is actually Chandni Luthra on behalf of Matt Fassler. Congratulations on the quarter. I just have a couple of questions. Could you please contextualize the cost or CapEx implications for the new DC next year?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "As far as the capital around the DC, is that question? We\u2019ve targeted about $70 million to $75 million for the facility. It will be a little bit larger than some of our other facilities, obviously due to the span and the number of stores that we anticipate that it will serve.", "Chandni Luthra \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Perfect. And you guys talked about strengths that you saw in big ticket items. Could you please frame this trend versus what it has been in the last five years? I mean, is this a particularly stand out period or was this cyclically driven? And do you think this is sustainable going forward?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes. As far as the big ticket items, what we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years is that our customer is really need based. And so, it has been very difficult for us to read relative to the big ticket. For example, included in our big ticket is gun safes. Over the last two years there\u2019s been significant activity around that.", "There were some cyclical business like our riding lawn mower business. That\u2019s been somewhat stagnated down over the last seven years, but we\u2019ve seen some fairly positive activity this year. So it\u2019s very difficult to judge whether it\u2019s cyclical or it\u2019s just sort of need based, or if it\u2019s economy based and people are just feeling a little bit better and feel that they have the opportunity to go out and spend on some of the larger items.", "So at this point in time, we\u2019re still not willing to commit that big ticketed fact that people are will to spend right now. But it is something that we\u2019re watching and we did like what we saw as we moved through the quarter and in some of the larger ticket sales, like running lawn movers, some of the power equipment, heating and items like log splitters.", "Chandni Luthra \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you. And one final quick question. I know this has been talked about already. But if you could just contextualize the implications of the recent commodity price declines for inflation or deflation going forward, and in terms of its margins? And what would it do so based on the \u2013 where do you see the impact from this current commodity price action on a go forward basis?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "We had talked about it just recently on another question. We tend to really try to wake and do it more on a quarter-by-quarter basis because the prices do tend to move. So I prefer to provide more specific guidance and so we give our full year guidance on the January conference call. But generally speaking, we believe that there will be some deflation next year. We expected to hopefully moderate from what we saw this year which was approximately 90 basis points to 100 basis points of impact. When do have deflation, it obviously hurts the top line, but at the same time it generally will benefit gross margin rate. So we can have a little pickup there. And again, it is our position as a management team that we are expected to manage deflation and inflation as we moved through \u2013 as we continue to manage the business in sales and margin.", "Chandni Luthra \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "", "Perfect, thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. Good results. You mentioned, Greg, last quarter that you would be less promotional in the third quarter and its sounds like the business stay true to that. Last quarter traffic was not as good and I think some of the promos were to get people in or spend a little more. This quarter the traffic seem better, the weather was more seasonal. So, I don\u2019t know is there any second thoughts on whether you putting promos on to better traffic environments would have even gotten a better result and I have a follow-up for Tony.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I would tell you Simeon that our customers are need based and we are a destination store. We knew that as the weather would improve and it always does it\u2019s just a matter of timing. We have the tale of two stories here in the third quarter. We had a continuation of spring summer, which we were able to chase and the merchants did a wonderful job of pulling product into that and feed that trend. And at the same time, in the Northern part of the country, we start seeing really stronger action to the early selling and heating another fall type product as Tony has mentioned. So when we start seeing those two kind of collide, there is no reason to step up the promotional base. And as a matter of fact, we only run 15, 16 rotations a year. We like that strategy. We don\u2019t want to call up in a strategy longer-term of thing. It\u2019s got to be a coupon to buy something attractive. I got to wait for the next ad and so on and so forth. And that\u2019s what a lot of the people we compete would do. And that\u2019s just not our business models. So no I don\u2019t think we would have driven any more business really to any great extent by laying on more promotion.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And you mentioned you avoided doing any major promotions and I think it sounds like also the lesson learned from last quarter is that something that we\u2019re not going to see repeated weather it\u2019s a few quarters down the road or a couple of years down the road is that fair?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I think that\u2019s fair, but I would also tell you that if we were starting to see foot traffic slow that would be a different story, but we continue to see good solid foot traffic and that\u2019s an indicator for us that, we still got customers coming through the front doors and as long as that stay solid we\u2019re going to stick with our plans.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then my follow-up on the guidance for comp and not to get too cute with the guidance, but I think the implies for the year backs you into the fourth quarter anywhere between \u2013 slightly positive to somewhere six to maybe a midpoint of three and I think that\u2019s just a plain math, but the lower end of that would seem overly conservative for you based on history. So is there purpose behind keeping it that wide, extra weather or is that just simple conservatism?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "When we set the guidance it is sort of difficult. The one area where we have the three different sales \u2013 comp sales and the earnings. On a full year basis, the comp guidance is a little bit wide. We just felt that we didn\u2019t want to try to narrow it specifically, but we assume that you all will sort of work up of what you think the reasonable comp is given the context around the directions that we\u2019ve given you for the fourth quarter and sort of come up with reason a reasonable comp. We did state that we believe that het comp will be at the higher end of the range. And so that in our mind sort of put you somewhere between 3.3 and 3.8 for the full year. So somewhere in that area and then obviously whatever the math works out to get into that range. So we don\u2019t think that it\u2019s relatively conservative and I don\u2019t believe if you do the math, you come out to 3 for the quarter.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "That\u2019s helpful. One more to sneak in back for Greg. I know you mentioned the hometown store and that sounds like you don\u2019t want to answer a whole lot of questions on them, but I\u2019ll try one.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Okay", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Franklin and Fairview, I mean we can look at the demographics from the internet here, anything specific about those towns to tell you about at least geographically, what you\u2019re thinking about the strategy? I mean is it going to be more of a rural concept the way the Tractor is or are you thinking more suburban?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, you\u2019re correct on the location selection. It was done purposely. The Franklin location sits equidistant between two Tractor stores that sit in rural environments, maybe a little bit more on the edge of suburbia and the unit that sits out in Fairview sits only a quarter of mile away in the rural environment from a current Tractor. So this is going to give us pretty good read of the type of customers that we will attract to this store format.", "Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay thanks and good luck.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.", "Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, this is Gary. I\u2019ll ask only one question unlike Simeon and everybody else, who asked three. First of all, congratulations on a great quarter. That doesn\u2019t count as a question.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thanks, Gary. Thank you, Gary.", "Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse", "The question is, if you look back over the last few years to or specifically some of the feed categories have been by far your strongest areas, which will be growing significantly in that area including hay. What are you seeing competitively, like whether it\u2019s Rural King or Horseshine or Mills? Are any of these companies starting to expand their fees offerings to try to compete more directly with CUE? What have you seen in that regard? Thank you.", "Steve K. Barbarick", "", "Yes. This is Steve. They are all formidable competitors. I mean they do a very nice job with their assortments. They recognize there is need in the marketplace. We\u2019ve got as Greg mentioned we\u2019ll be in 49 states or shortly. We continue to see momentum in Q, we\u2019re growing our units, we think we\u2019re picking up share, we\u2019ve talked a lot about independence as well and we\u2019re picking up some of that share. So I would tell you in general the market I think we\u2019re out in front of the marketplace. I think we\u2019re continuing to grow and expand what we\u2019re doing in this area.", "And really the focus for us in Q is three key things. We\u2019re constantly looking at refining our assortments. Two, we\u2019re making strategic investments that we\u2019re better in stock and we\u2019re a better dependable supplier of basic maintenance needs. And three, we\u2019ve done a really nice job using our price optimization system, so we\u2019re right and we\u2019ll price locally making sure that we\u2019re taking care those customers. So we think that there is continued growth here using those free tactics.", "Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse", "You haven\u2019t seen the other, more direct competitors change their mix at all to try to do what you\u2019re doing given your strength?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "", "I would tell you there is a lot of folks out there that are doing a lot of different things. And we try to stay focused on what we\u2019re doing rather than chasing a lot of the competitors. I would tell you that by copying if that\u2019s the case and that\u2019s the way they want to go, that\u2019s a fine forms of flattery but we\u2019re continuing to pickup share. We\u2019re going to stay true to what we\u2019re focused on.", "Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse", "That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Thank you, Gary.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you very much. Greg with respect to the two HomeTown Pet stores, can you just give a little bit more color on the impetus for testing those concepts now. And more importantly, what is that speak to your convection level of your core concept as well as the smaller format. Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I only give you this Alan that we have a very robust pet business in general in the company and we believe that we can do more pet business. But we don\u2019t want to distort the interior of the Tractor Supply format, because it\u2019s many stores with inside a store. And that format works well. It continues to perform well. So our thought process was if we believe we\u2019re owed more pet business, how would we go about maybe achieving that and how do we understand how to grow, still grow the pet business inside of Tractor. Are there are pieces and parts that maybe we\u2019re missing that we don\u2019t understand. So that was the impetus of putting these two test concepts out there.", "Alan Rifkin \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Do you still believe that you can have the same number 2,200, 2,300 of the core concept?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Absolutely, without question.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "", "One correction there. We feel that\u2019s 2,100 right now. So we\u2019re very confident in that number. We\u2019ll obviously continue to look at sites up over and above that, but right now we feel that 2,100, we\u2019re very confident with that number.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.", "Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Nice quarter guys.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Thank you.", "Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "My first question is just around your customers. You guys have pretty good information on your customers now. You\u2019re stuck with them in a few different categories. Do you have any sense of how they\u2019ve been reacting to various macro and farm income forces over the last few quarters? Has there been any difference in trends?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I\u2019ll try to answer that. What I can tell you is this, that they continue to buy the way they\u2019ve been buying for the last three to four years. They\u2019re credit averse. They\u2019re paying with cash and with debit about the same rate as they have been. They continue to repair and not replace, although, we did see a little bit of movement this year because of the elongated spring/summer season. And there is some big ticket transactions that I would say, were new units in outdoor power equipment.", "But though, they\u2019re very consistent and that\u2019s what we like about this customer base, they\u2019re fairly predictable. And they have not shown us any indication that they want to take on any type of short-term debt to do something out of the ordinary. So, no, very consistent performance, very persistent behavior.", "Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Got you. So no major differences in rate of sales contribution from the hog farmers or production farmers or lifestylers or anything like that?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "No.", "Seth Basham \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Okay. And my follow-up is just around, thinking about the fourth quarter, given the favorable weather trends in September, in particular, you had good cold weather year oriented sales. Do you feel like you may have pulled forward some sales from the fourth quarter?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "I\u2019ll answer that question. At this point, we don\u2019t anticipate that. Like I mentioned, we do like cold weather and while October temperatures are what they are, November and December are very important months for us.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Very good. Thank you very much", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you very much and congratulations on a great quarter.", "Lee J. Downing", "Thank you, Denise.", "Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, so you said all the regions were comping mid-single-digit, but I think that going into the quarter, you had expected that in the Northeast and the upper Midwest the delayed on-set of summer would lead to some demand destruction, because of the very short and a gardening season? Looking at categories in those markets, did you actually see that?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes, I would tell you up north, we\u2019d talked about the extended season, our ag products performance, lawn and garden and everything did pretty well. And that\u2019s comping the prior year where we had a very strong Q3. So year-over-year we a saw nice consistent growth.", "Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks. And in term SG&A leverage, you said that which was much better than we had expected. So is that about one-third of that was coming from incentive comp, was the rest from just the higher comp, or were there some other factors?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Denise this is Tony. As we\u2019ve moved into the back half of the year coming off Q2 we were very focused on managing the SG&A. So we believe that we are aggressive when it came to the expense control and that combined with the strong comp sales really gave us that significant leverage. And then one key thing that I had mentioned on the prepared remarks was that, in Q2 medical and workers\u2019 comp were very high and they moderated, so that gave us some additional leverage, as well.", "Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, got it thanks. And just lastly to kind of go back to this, I guess nearly dead horse. Actually how much have feed costs declined, because we\u2019ve talked about deflation and very broad terms in terms of your total comp. But how much of feed gone down because I\u2019m just wondering for the person whose got a couple of horses, what are they saving because it just doesn\u2019t seem just clear with these strength and big ticket, for example, on small agricultural equipment like mowers that you were talking about.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Just give you indication, we always corn and sort of the main factor is the component in the feed category. And year-over-year it was around $4.50 last year were down to little bit below $3.50 this year. So you can see that there was a significant impact on a year-over-year basis. But directionally this actually give you an idea of the impact.", "Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, all right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Miller with William Blair.", "Mark R. Miller \u2013 William Blair & Company LLC", "Hi, good afternoon or good evening at this point. I appreciate the color that the weather helped the business, not just talking about when it\u2019s negative. Is there way to estimate what that benefit was in the period as drought like conditions fell further year-on-year? And I think Tony your guidance for 4Q looks like about a four comp. So would that be sort of taking a ex-weather benefit run rate of around four in the third quarter and continuing it on or what\u2019s the weather impact bigger than that?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Mark, it\u2019s definitely difficult to make that assessment. We do look at some of the spring categories what the lift was overall, but the other complexity when you get into some of the cold winter products, selling log splitters in August, it seems to be counterintuitive. And so between the extended and the winter, I would say it would be on an injustice to try to quantify exactly what the weather impact was. As we move forward, we look at the weather as having a nice cold wintery December, but we believe there is opportunity \u2013 when last year it was a cold wintery December. This year as we move forward, we believe there\u2019s some opportunity in October and November with a potentially cooler October, November. But generally as we move into the fourth quarter, we are optimistic that people will recant last year\u2019s harsh winter and get out and do a little shopping earlier in the quarter.", "Mark R. Miller \u2013 William Blair & Company LLC", "Okay. And then can you just share with us your updated thoughts for store growth a little bit longer-term. You did mention that 8% footage or store growth. I thought there was some consideration being given to potentially going to a constant number of openings per store. Is that something you\u2019re reflecting on? Or do you think you can continue to drive the 8% over a number of years?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Currently, our position is the 8% growth and we will take a look at growth on an annual basis and make determination as to what we believe is the most beneficial for the company and for the shareholder. So we\u2019ll take a look that as we sort of cycle into the New Year and potentially we can address that as we move into the Analyst Day.", "Mark R. Miller \u2013 William Blair & Company LLC", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.", "Brian W. Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Hi, good evening.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Hi, Brian.", "Brian W. Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Congrats on very nice quarter.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "Thank you.", "Brian W. Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "I just have a couple of quick questions here, since towards the end of the queue. But first on the SG&A expense, and Tony you spoke about this a bit in your prepared remarks. We saw a nice leverage, actually I guess reduced SG&A growth here in the quarter. You look at that 80 basis points in leverage. How much of that you think reflected more or less one-time benefits here that we should probably not expect as we go into Q4, or even into 2015?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, the first thing that I would generally carve out and it\u2019s a little bit difficult to predict is really the incentive compensation. So right off the bat, I\u2019d say carve out the one-third and then look at the comp and the comp increase. When we look at our leverage points, depending on the quarter you can range from usually about 3% to potentially 4%. So that could be an indication that as we get above 3% on a comp, you\u2019re going to start to see some more leverage. And the main driver will be the sales comp. We will be able to manage some of the expenses and I think we\u2019ve done a good job in the back half, but, again, being a growth company we will continue to grow the SG&A and our goal is to do it at a lesser amount than we grow our sales base.", "Brian W. Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "", "That\u2019s very helpful. And then a follow-up question, again, which is a quick one, and I apologize if you already addressed this, but you\u2019ve taken your CapEx guidance down and there hasn\u2019t been a real adjustment to store openings. What\u2019s the reason behind that?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes, I had stated in the prepared remarks, some of the larger initiatives, and now we have a little bit more visibility on, have been pushed out during the course of the year. Specifically, the Southwest Distribution Center, we expected to have some capital expenditures this year and we do project to still have a few in the fourth quarter, and particular, some land purchase.", "We also expected to have additional lease space for our Northeast facility. We have identified some space very close to our current distribution center in Hagerstown and we expected some additional expense related to that, and some capital as well. So those projects got push back. And then, we usually maintain some CapEx dollars for the potential purchase of some of our lease stores in acquiring those properties, but we do not anticipate doing any this year in actuality. So that was a significant saving.", "So what I would reiterate and I think that is important, as we move forward into next year we have set a goal that we do not want to exceed CapEx of $250 million a year. So even with a portion of these projects being pushed into 2015 we will still maintain our CapEx at no higher than $250 million for 2015.", "Brian W. Nagel \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.

Crudele", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Hi, Greg, just a quick question about HomeTown Pet, if the two test stores are proved to be successful?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Would it ideally become a growth platform, a new growth platform for Tractor Supply or is that to convince some of the channel exclusive brands that currently are not selling the Tractor that you could responsibly and effectively carry those brands in your full line stores and therefore not need to rollout the HomeTown Pet?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "As I stated before Dan, hometown is a test of two stores. You hit on it that there is going to be some mix of products in those stores that we currently do not carry in Tractor. And we\u2019ve got some learning here between these two locations. So I think that\u2019s about as much as I\u2019m willing to tell you at this point. We haven\u2019t got the first store opened yet and that\u2019s going to be in a couple weeks and there will be more to talk about some time in other part of next year I think.", "Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, great thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yes, hi, good afternoon guys. I will add my congratulations as well.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the mixing centers. I think this is a very important development especially given the growth in Q. If you could maybe tell us just a little bit more how sort of the size of these things the CapEx requirements relative to a DC, how quickly you can get them open? And then how that might change your views on growing the distribution sort of a capacity in networks going forward?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Well, I\u2019m I\u2019ll give you what I\u2019m comfortable to tell you, how about that?", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Sounds great.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "And that is that this is not going to displace distribution centers, but what it actually does is it allows us to improve our ability to service stores and also to take some pressure off of the supply chain. We\u2019ll have two operations opening in the South next spring. Average CapEx is about $8 million. We like to look at these as lease facilities first and build purchase facilities second. There in the way between 50,000 to 70,000 square feet. Think of it as an elongated age, a lot of doors on both sides where product comes in one side is quickly moved and sorted and pushed across in the trucks on the other side of the building. And this is kind of a rapid response methodology in a way. So what we\u2019ll do long-term, long-term it helps us to move high velocity, high bulk, low value product more cost effectively, that\u2019s the bottom line. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then given just sort of at least first or second, if you saw these two really help drive productivity, how quickly would you be able to ramp this going forward?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Great question. I don\u2019t have a direct answer for you on that. It will be a combination of \u2013 we\u2019ve already gotten some target markets where we believe if this works well we would go, but we have not worked on any additional leases or properties at this point.", "Adam Sindler \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi guys, this is [Cody Ross] (ph) filling in for Aram. Quick question and I\u2019ll make it brief. You had previously called out that localization of products is a big focus especially out West where the stores are farther apart. Can you just provide an update on that front? Thank you.", "Steve K. Barbarick", "", "Yes, absolutely. This is Steve. We\u2019re making great strides out there. I would tell you that the stores out in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada have different assortments than what you are going to find out East. Even the store Utah that we\u2019re going to open will be carrying beekeeping supplies. And yes, you\u2019ve heard me right, that is beekeeping supplies. We went out there, we research the market and we saw in a lot of our competitors and thought, well, we better put our best put forward out there when we move out there. So you are going to see a lot of localized products. We\u2019re continuing to refine what we are doing. We have ongoing conference calls with our store operators out there, because they are really leading us down the path of what those customers are asking for and we\u2019re tweaking our assortments as we move forward.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And that was in Utah you said you have the beekeeping supplies?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes. Yes, that\u2019s accurate.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay.", "", "Steve K. Barbarick", "", "And what\u2019s interesting about that is, you\u2019ve picked up, you\u2019ve learned little things here and there, and then you find over time that there may be more opportunities in other existing stores. So again these are all test-and-learn type formats in product categories, and we\u2019ll see how they do.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask I know it\u2019s still very small, but like with online purchases, are you seeing any different behavior like or what people buying online is it different, is it like skew towards more consumable or more big ticket or anything. Are you also seeing more pickup in store or desire to pickup in store than just a delivery? I was curious to just initial earnings that you are finding.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Joe, this is Greg. What we are finding is that our customers are looking for products either in what I would consider to be not standard in a typical tractor, but in other words, a long tail aspect SKUs that maybe with all Korean tractor, but are available online. And a category of product that we have to keep more narrow because of the store we want to get X amount of space. But we\u2019re seeing people do that. I\u2019ll give you an example in our business with portable buildings.", "We have an assortment inside the store for that, but online we have just elongated broad a long, long tail and they\u2019re buying out of the long tail. Larger buildings, different size buildings, custom buildings, and so on. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing a lot in our online business. There are some customers that are buying some dog food products that we sell in the stores, I\u2019m not going to tell you they\u2019re not, they\u2019re doing it for convenience. But its primarily the things that would be out of the long tail that you wouldn\u2019t find in our store.", "Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group", "", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful thanks. And one more and I apologize if I missed it before. But did you guys address we always ask about where you might stand with an affinity type of program. I know you\u2019ve been testing some different things I just wanted to get an update there.", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes, I\u2019ll go and take that, this is Steve. We brought on our director of customer marketing earlier this year because we felt like we needed to add to our expertise. He\u2019s come in, he\u2019s been a lot of very interesting things, his targeted e-mail and made us more relevant we\u2019re getting better click through rates and page opening rates. When it comes to affinity we\u2019ve had a number of cross functional meetings, we\u2019re right now in the process of building some business requirements for it.

Montagna \u2013 Avondale Partners, LLC", "Hi, question about plan-o-grams, based on one of your answers during Q&A its sounds like you have one more quarter of the big benefit from the plan-o-gram research. So I just want to make sure that\u2019s accurate. But then, if that\u2019s true, have you cycled through the entire square footage of the store but with the new plan-o-gram center I would assume it\u2019s fair to assume you can take that to another higher meaningful level of the effectiveness. I just want to make sure I\u2019m interpreting that all correct.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Yes, for the most part you are. I mean I may have misspoken when I just said one quarter and I don\u2019t want to over build it. I would say that we had a very solid Q3, we saw performance we hadn\u2019t seen in the past. You would anticipate that to continue forward, but again things can change, customer habits can change. I feel very good about the progress we made on that side of the store. The new plan-o-gram center will allow us to be more effective looking at. So I would say we\u2019re constantly in a test-and-learn mode and that\u2019s where, I\u2019ll leave it.", "Mark K. Montagna \u2013 Avondale Partners, LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "I just got one follow-up question, which is distribution related. Is there way to quantify the impact of sort of an ideal distribution network when you roll out the new facility in the Southwest and the West and the expansion in Northeast? Obviously there\u2019s a tradeoff between the CapEx and P&L, but do you think that the benefit to gross margin is in the tens of basis points or on lower stem miles or potentially a lot better than that?", "Anthony F. Crudele", "", "When we look at it, we look at the distribution network or a distribution center as we build them at full capacity. The cost of the building will net against the transportation cost. So we look at them generally as neutral and depending on when we eventually push to two to three shifts, we do expect some benefit that would outweigh the cost. So from a modeling perspective, I would tend to show the increase in SG&A with a comparable offset in gross margin transportation.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. And I guess, just as a follow-up to that. After you have these new facilities that you\u2019ve discussed up and running, how many units \u2013 what\u2019s your total capacity in terms of the number of the units you can serve post these new facilities?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "Relative to the distribution centers, our long-term plan is obviously 2015 do a facility in the Southwest. And we target about two years after that looking at the Northwest. And then, eventually depending on the capacity, the added capacity from the additional leased space in the Northeast, we\u2019ll eventually be looking at the Northeast as well. So once we\u2019re there we would expect that we would be able to exceed the 2,100 that we currently have. We anticipate that from a distribution center capacity we would be able to exceed that number as well as have some additional capacity through the mixing center network as well.", "Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "", "Okay, great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our final question from Brent Rystrom from Feltl.", "Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company", "Thank you, and good morning. A quick couple of thoughts for you. I was thinking about all the questions on the farm economy. And so as an observation as somebody who is a farmer and lives in the Midwest, the 2012 crop, which was the drought crop that became so valuable, was worth about $64 billon, the corn drop. And from a simplistic perspective as production rebounded in 2013, the value of the realized value of that crop was about $54 billion. When you look at the futures curve right now and you look at the projections for yields, it looks like the current crop is valued at about $53 billion. It would seem to me that if there is indeed a risk or an impact from the slowing farm economy, it would have hit you on the $64 billion to $54 billion drop, not the $54 billion to $53 billion. Does that make sense?", "", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "It definitely makes sense. Again, we don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s that direct correlation and I can appreciate taking\u2026", "Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company", "I understand that but everybody seems to be fixated on this and from a simplistic perspective\u2026", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "It would have already come, is what you\u2019re saying...", "Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company", "Yes.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes.", "Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company", "And so if it even is an impact, wouldn\u2019t it have implied to you that the impact was in the second half of 2013 and the first half of 2014, when those prices that dropped has realized at that point, which coincidentally coincided with some very supportive comps for you guys?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes\u2026", "Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company", "Whether it was related or not, it happened already\u2026", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes\u2026", "Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company", "And right now it doesn\u2019t look like there is pricing in any significant change the current crop, which started getting harvest right now compared to last year\u2019s. So I just want to say that seems reasonable, right?", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Yes.", "Anthony F. Crudele", "", "Yes.", "", "Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company", "All right. Then I was at the Industrial Pellet Association Conference in Miami earlier this month and there were dozens of small retailers from New England and the Midwest there. And all of them saying that they\u2019re having a very difficult time finding wood pellets for this season and you guys were cited as a reason, which I view as a positive for you, in that as you guys grow your business in the wood pellet business and as a couple of your other big box competitors do as well, it\u2019s getting more difficult for the smaller players to buy wood pellets, particularly as the export market for wood pellets heats up. You guys appear to be really, really well positioned for this. I\u2019m just sensing this could be a very big opportunity this fall in the wood pellet business for you guys seasonally. Would you care to comment on that?", "Steve K. Barbarick", "Yes, this is Steve. I would tell you that heating a big business for us. We did make some strategic investments across all lines of heating and I think we\u2019re well positioned as we go into November, December.", "Brent Rystrom \u2013 Feltl and Company", "Thanks, guys.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "Thank you, Brent.", "Operator", "It appears there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Skold, I would like to turn the conference back to you for additional or closing remarks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort", "", "This is Greg. Let me just close by saying thank you all for your interest and support of Tractor Supply.

Greg, please go ahead.", "Gregory Sandfort", "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Steve Barbarick, our EVP Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Lee Downing, our EVP of Store Operations and Real Estate.", "We\u2019re very pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2015 and the ongoing trends within our business. Our comparable store sales for the quarter increased 5.7% and our increase was once again driven by both traffic and ticket. Transaction counts increased 4.8%, while average ticket improved 80 basis points in the quarter. This was our 22nd consecutive quarter of positive comp store sales and our 28th consecutive quarter of positive comp transaction counts.", "Sales were balanced across the store and throughout the quarter, with all of our major merchandise categories and geographic regions delivering positive solid comps. Our merchandising and inventory management teams did an excellent job of managing assortments and flow of inventory to deliver strong sales for the quarter.", "We had the right products at the right time to meet customer demand in both seasonal and everyday products. In seasonal, we made several strategic investments in heating, footwear and apparels that met strong demand in cold weather items in the northern tier of our stores.", "Similarly, we had the right assortment of spring merchandise when the weather began to turn more in our southern markets. This allowed us to meet the initial demand and drive sales in a number of spring seasonal categories towards the latter part of the first quarter. Categories such as fencing and live goods, lawn and garden and outdoor power equipment all performed very well in the quarter. We also saw very solid performance from many of our everyday staples and consumable, usable and edible products.", "We continue to experience sales momentum in the left-hand side of the store. The planogram updates we executed in truck accessories and winches along with several other categories in hardlines this past year continued to resonate with our customers.", "And as we discussed on our last call, IT systems and our supply chain remain key areas of focus for 2015 and we continue to make solid progress against these initiatives. The rollout of our new demand planning system is on target and we will continue adding categories throughout the year.", "Construction of a new distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona is on schedule and this new facility is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2015. The two mixing centers in Texas are also under construction and are scheduled to open in the third quarter of this year.", "We opened 41 new stores in the quarter and we remain on track to open 110 to 115 new Tractor Supply stores this year. Progress continues with the conversion of the Del\u2019s stores to the Tractor format and we expect to close seven Del\u2019s stores this year as we backfill the State of Washington with Tractor Supply formats.", "And lastly, we are pleased with our ongoing efforts and progress to enhance our omni-channel platform, our customer relationship management platform and the broadening of our IT network security across our entire organization.", "2015 is off to a solid start, and while it is still early in the year, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from a more normalized spring weather pattern as the momentum of our business has continued into April.", "In closing, let me thank all of our dedicated team members out there in our stores [indiscernible] who go the country mile everyday for our customers who live this lifestyle.", "We appreciate your time today. I will now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our financials for the quarter. Tony?", "Anthony Crudele", "Great, thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 28, 2015, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 12.5% to $1.3 billion and net income grew 18.9% to $58 million or $0.42 per diluted share. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with both our top line and bottom line performance for the quarter.", "Comp store sales increased 5.7% in the first quarter compared to an increase of 2.2% in last year\u2019s first quarter. We had a very strong winter selling season, specifically in February as cold weather drove our sales and assisted us in the clearance of winter products.", "We did enter the quarter in a higher inventory position than in the prior year which benefited sales, but resulted in more clearance having a slightly negative impact on gross margin. The sales momentum continued into March, although the average temperatures were still colder than normal, they were warmer than last year in the majority of our sales regions which spurred strong spring seasonal sales. This was particularly evident in the South and Southwest regions.", "We are extremely pleased with the strong sales results for the quarter and the team should be commended as we accomplished this against several headwinds which included deflation, closed store days and logistics issues related to winter storms and challenges from the West Coast port congestion.", "Comp transaction count increased for the 28th consecutive quarter, gaining 4.8% on top of a 4.4% increase last year. As Greg indicated, the strength in sales was very broad-based. Few items such as the pet and heating consumables continued to perform well, but we also had strong sales in key winter categories such as insulated outerwear and rubber footwear as well as spring seasonal categories such as riding lawn mowers, fencing and lawn and garden.", "Average comp ticket increased by 80 basis points versus last year\u2019s 201% decline. We are very pleased with the composition of the comp ticket increase given deflation and effectively no impact from big ticket. The increases were primarily from an increase in items per transaction, trade up in key categories such as animal and bird feed, and an increase in bulk transactions such as fencing. This increase was partially offset by deflation which we estimate at 87 basis points and was consistent with our expectations. The deflation was driven principally by the livestock feed, bird feed, lubricant and propane categories.", "With respect to big ticket, we\u2019re pleased with the kickoff to the spring selling season as we saw a nice lift in riding lawn mowers and trailers. This increase in big ticket was partially offset by the continued decline in the gun fit category and thus big ticket did not contribute to the increase in the average ticket.", "On a regional basis, comp sales were possible across all regions, as sales in the North benefited from colder weather in the first half of the quarter and the sales in the South benefited from favorable spring weather in March. The Western region comp sales were above chain average as our newer Western stores continue to gain market awareness and share.", "With respect to gross margin, we anticipated that gross margin would be a tough comparison to last year, but it was only slightly down at 8 basis points to 33.4%. If you recall, many winter related items sold out early in the quarter last year and gross margin benefited from limited clearance activity. This year we ended the quarter better in stock. Although the favorable colder weather in January and February provided strong sell through of our seasonal winter product, we had more inventory in our clearance pipeline. This had a slight negative impact on margin, but benefited sales.", "Additionally, we had less new store discounts in the quarter as Q1 gross margin last year benefited from several store openings late in 2013. Shrink was also slightly negative in the quarter as we cycle favorable results in the prior year. We did have several items that favorably impacted gross margin. Sales was favorable by 5 basis point which was a direct result of the lower [indiscernible]. The favorable fuel price offset the increase in stem miles from our Western store expansion.", "Merchandise mix had a favorable impact as some higher margin categories increased as a percent of total sales. Deflation had a positive impact on gross margin as we focused on maintaining margin dollars per unit.", "Import purchases in the quarter increased 5.2% and represented 11.5% of sales mix, also exclusive brand sales increased over 10.8% compared to last year\u2019s Q1 and was approximately 32% of sales.", "For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 26.4% of sales compared to 26.8% in the prior year\u2019s quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points. We are pleased with our expense control in the quarter, which coupled with the strong comp sales, provided solid leverage. We experienced favorable trends in medical, marketing, and various occupancy expense categories. We were able to leverage store personnel despite having made additional investment in store payrolls surrounding store initiatives.", "Incentive compensation had a deleveraging impact of 26 basis points as incentive compensation increased year over year based on the strength of the quarter results. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.9% in Q1 compared to 37.6% last year, resulting from the availability of state tax incentives.", "Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of Q1, we had cash balance of $57 million and borrowings of $60 million compared to a cash balance of $48 million and debt of $80 million last year. During the first quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired approximately 596,000 shares for $47.9 million. We estimate that the share repurchase program for the quarter did not have a material impact on EPS.", "Average inventory levels per store increased 2.7% compared to the prior year. We are very comfortable with our inventory position as we made a strategic investment in certain spring merchandise and imports were timed a little earlier to work around the Chinese New Year. Annualized turns improved by 1 basis point for the quarter.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48.8 million as compared to $41.9 million last year. We opened 41 stores and closed one store in the first quarter compared to 32 new stores opened in the first quarter of 2014. The increase relates to the construction expenditures of our Southwest D.C., which were higher than expenditures on our store support center which was under construction last year.", "With respect to our financial expectations for the full year 2015, as noted in today\u2019s press release, we have reiterated our previous guidance. While our Q1 performance was very strong and Q2 is off to a good start, as we said in the past, it is best to evaluate a performance by the half as we see the spring season play out in full. Therefore, we believe it\u2019s prudent to revisit our guidance at the end of the second quarter.", "As a reminder, we still expect full year sales range from $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion; we have forecasted comp sales to increase between 2.5% and 4%; we\u2019re targeting EBIT margins to be flat to 10 basis points of improvement compared to 2014; we expect a modest improvement in gross margin; and SG&A leverage will be dependent on the sales level achieved. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $403 million to $417 million or $2.95 to $3.05 per diluted share.", "We still expect capital expenditures in 2015 to range between $240 million to $250 million. We\u2019ll continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and estimate full year diluted shares outstanding to be between 136 million and 137 million. We continue to be estimate deflation for the full year to average approximately 50 basis points and we anticipate the impact will be higher in the first half of the year and moderating downward in the second half of the year. In terms of the cadence for gross margin percent improvement, we target slight year over year improvement in each of the upcoming quarters.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.", "Peter Benedict", "First, maybe Greg, the current view of consumer shelf, your customer shelf, I mean obviously the numbers looks to be pretty good, but if you go below the high level numbers, any signs you are seeing positive or negative in terms of the behavior of your customer in any specific regions, whether it would be in the oil related markets or anything else that you would call out that\u2019s maybe been changing over the last 3 to 6 months?", "Gregory Sandfort", "I would tell you that steadier she goes, the consumer that shops with us seems to be in a bit of a predictable pattern. They are still buying needs based product, they\u2019re still repairing and not doing probably as much replacements as they did in the past, although we have seen bit of an uptick in outdoor power equipment in the first part of the year, but that\u2019s not to say that conditions can change.", "We are not seeing anything really different. They\u2019re still buying feed and food, they\u2019re still keeping their properties because \u2013 our fencing business was great as we mentioned, and our feed and food businesses continue strong. So I would tell you very stable, if anything probably as the economy could improve a bit maybe towards the latter part of this year and into next year, we may see little bit of an uptick, but nothing that would alarm us at all.", "Peter Benedict", "And then remind us about the cadence of spring life share, I remember you said it late, and you guys resorted to some incremental promotions, at what point did that set in in the second quarter last year? And then maybe how are you planning this season differently in some of these key categories, like OP and the riders, some of your live good product, because it obviously sounds like this spring is getting off to a better start.", "Gregory Sandfort", "First of all, last year we just had a major delay with Mother Nature and weather and until the weather broke we were managing inventories well and just we\u2019re trying to understand how much business could be recapture as we got into latter part of the second quarter and into third.", "And as far as adding promotions, all we did was just somewhat remind consumer we are still there for them and that we made them aware of some of the offers and such. So we spent a little money, but nothing major. We didn\u2019t do anything crazy as far as pricing and such last year, we just stayed patient.", "No, this year very different. We are having a more normalized spring season and we don\u2019t plan at this point to anniversary any of those, I will call them, reminder type pieces that we did last year in the latter part of second and early into third quarter, if the trends continue as we see them. So we are feeling more comfortable about current trends, but there is no additional plans to go back and anniversary some of those things that we did a year ago.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.", "Simeon Gutman", "One quick question on gross margin and then something strategic. Just in terms of the clearance merchandise activity, could you just tell us in order of magnitude what that could held down gross margin? And if you can\u2019t, maybe directionally, what roughly the percentage of items sold on clearance was and maybe in terms of magnitude of the markdown?", "Steve Barbarick", "I would tell you the magnitude is relatively insignificant. We did see, like Tony said, a bit of a sales gain, but as you come out of the season like that, the tail of those sales become smaller and smaller. And so the magnitude of the impact is pretty immaterial to the total business. There may have been a slight impact, but it would be nothing that will be material.", "Simeon Gutman", "And then the second question for Greg, just thinking about categories in a store and how it flows, and I know you have the new mock store, I don\u2019t know what you call it, but the new planogram area at FHC, was that designed to just look at how you execute certain categories, are you thinking there is a bigger wholesale change in how you flow the store over time?", "Gregory Sandfort", "I think this is a two-part question, Steve will answer as much as I can here, but the MIC, the merchandise innovation center is our ability to take a complete Tractor store and look at it from a standpoint of planogram sets, lower store, visual signage, just generally as you walk in to a store, we didn\u2019t have that capability in the former space that we had in the old facility and we felt like if we couldn\u2019t really do the same thing in this new facility because of the ceiling height and such, so we went outside and it\u2019s been very productive. I think I will let Steve take it from there.", "Steve Barbarick", "One of the greatest benefits of it is the size is all the products that we have in a normal store and to be able to get the merchants out there, the marketers out there, even people internally that have to deal with stores on a day-in, day-out basis, we can walk those planograms, we can assess the profitability per square foot, we can try a lot of things out there and get a visual that all at one time rather than breaking in apart in little 4 and 8 foot sections. So really it\u2019s a matter of efficiencies, getting things handed to the stores more timely and really better execution.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.", "Aram Rubinson", "One of the things that\u2019s hard to just do is to have continued success without showing any signs of complacency. I think you have done that. Just wondering what it is you are doing internally to kind of fight against that trend? It seems like you still have not invited in new competition, you are still one of the very few retailers that doesn\u2019t have competitors. So can you give us a little bit more color on what you are doing to try and sustain that, it seems pretty difficult to do?", "Steve Barbarick", "And I would tell you that\u2019s cultural, that\u2019s in the fabric of Tractor Supply Company. When we talk about continuous improvement, TVS, processes, when you talk about relentless dissatisfaction, you everything from stores to operations to everyone else, we\u2019re focused on making sure that we are running a little faster and jumping a little higher than we did the year before.", "I would tell you that when we walk planograms there is no \u2013 this works. And we\u2019re just going to leave it as it is. We will just talk about good as the enemy of great and how we are going to get better at each quarter and each year. So part of what we do and part of what you continually hear from this management team is taking it to the next level.", "In terms of competition, we can\u2019t necessarily impact people coming into the market place, but we\u2019re focused on us in making our business better and really supporting the customers that live lifestyle that we support.", "Aram Rubinson", "And I just got a follow up just to ask about your customer, as you get to learn more about him and hopefully her, can you help us dimensionalize to share your customer today and how you think what over time that might change?", "Gregory Sandfort", "Today the mix of our consumer base is fairly equal male to female. What I think we are finding is that their ability to use us for more things as they shop our stores is what we are starting to see and we are enjoying that, meaning that they may have started out shopping with us buying for their horses, let\u2019s say, products for the horses, and then he noticed we are in the pet business, and the next thing they know they get their pet business, and then from there they may move to another category, whether it might be holding or could be something in the hardware department.", "So what we\u2019re starting to understand now is that this hobby lifestyler is more open to shop Tractor for more than just maybe the things than initially thought. I will also tell you that we noticed in our parking lots it\u2019s not always pickup trucks, you may see a BMW, you may see someone walk in in a suit and tie, because they happen their own property and they work in a city, an attorney or what have you. So this crossover of consumer right now, we\u2019re starting to track some things and starting to notice that we are not \u2013 there\u2019s not a barrier to shop or store may be as it may have been in the past.", "The name Tractor Supply sometimes shows people, but once they cross the threshold or they hear about us from someone else, a lot of this is word-of-mouth, they are delighted. We have a lot of families that shop our stores. And if it starts with that age, maybe the grandfather to the son and then from there to the children, we are just kind of perpetuation of how the business can develop over the years.", "So I think we are in a great spot, we like what we see with our consumer base and we continue to see more transactions coming through the front door, footsteps as well. So right now there is more for us to do to learn more about these consumers and talk to them in a more direct manner, but I think we are well on our way.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers", "So I wanted to follow up on the weather question, would you describe the first quarter is relatively normal even in your northern tier stores through the end of March and how do you think it plays out over the next two quarters? The past two years had a pretty late start to spring in the North, back to back years, but you also had the seasonal business extend into August and September. So just curious how you are thinking about the flow of the business over the next couple of quarters.", "Steve Barbarick", "I would tell you that you could probably look at certain parts of the north and say that they may have had even delayed spring to normal, but I would tell you based on the prior two years it was earlier. And we were able to capitalize on that business both in terms of seasonal sales cold and spring related products.", "We are going to continue to buy into the spring, knowing that there is demand out there. It\u2019s just too early at this point for us to pull back for the South or for the north. So I don\u2019t see anything that we would do outside of the way we are operating today and that is making sure those stores have the inventory they need. I\u2019m not sure I answered your question specifically.", "Christopher Horvers", "I think that\u2019s fair. I guess the last part of the question is do you think that last past two years you had a shift into August and September on the seasonal business, does it more of normalized start result in sort of shorter season on the back end comparatively?", "Steve Barbarick", "I would tell you right now it\u2019s just too early to predict the full year and even whether or not the selling season is going to be extended. Our guidance assumes a normalized spring selling season, that\u2019s really the best I can tell you at this point at this time of the year.", "Christopher Horvers", "And then on the margin front, Tony, so the fuel savings offset the freight \u2013 the stem mile pressures, is there anything one time in nature about that, feasibly one would think that may be through freight negotiations you would get more benefit in future quarters and provide some extra belief as you progress throughout the year?", "Anthony Crudele", "There was nothing unusual in the quarter. As we have talked in the past about our transportation costs, there is the cost themselves, there is the fuel component which is about 20% of the cost and then there is the stem mile issue that we talked about. In this case, we\u2019ve not seen any significant increase in the transportation cost and obviously fuel was decreased and that\u2019s what offset the stem miles.", "As we move forward I remind you that we will be opening more stores out in the West, so that will add to the stem miles. But as we move forward with the fuel prices, obviously that will be an ongoing benefit if the prices stay low and help to reduce the additional cost related to the stem miles.", "Christopher Horvers", "On the incentive comp, was that basically just a timing shift and there will be a quarter may be later in the year in the back half with a stronger that incentive comp will end up being a benefit or was the incentive comp accrual maybe shifted out relative to your original plan?", "Anthony Crudele", "No, in this case the incentive comp is going to match up with the performance that was in the quarter itself and again we will look at both the quarter and the performance and we\u2019ll also you look at our expectations for the full year. But when you look on a quarter to quarter basis, Q1 this year to last year, this was a much stronger quarter and required us to book additional incentive compensation.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.", "Seth Sigman", "Tony, I think you talked a little bit about trading up as one of the ticket offsets. At analyst day, I think you\u2019ve highlighted some plans across a number of different categories to maybe modify the assortment, fill the gap between good and best price points, just wondering and I think you highlighted power tools as may be an example that you are going to change over in the first quarter, just speak a little bit about some of the work you\u2019re doing on that front and may be where there are other categories with opportunities for that?", "Steve Barbarick", "Let me start by saying that the inside of the box is in continued flux and change and that\u2019s part of the whole relentless dissatisfaction talk that we had. One of the resets that we\u2019re doing in planogram work that we have got going on in the stores is to tap into missing price points and/or brands that we may not have today offering the customer value at the middle part of the equation or premium products.", "I will give you just one example here, because I can probably go through a number of them, but in May, we\u2019re going to be launching an extended line of livestock feeds for our consumers, a product that we did not have access to prior to this point in working with Parena and having the chequerboard product, we will have access to a super premium equivalent feed. We\u2019re going to bring in a new line of cattle feed and lastly we will have show feeds for those folks that do for H and FFA, which again we didn\u2019t have access to previously. So that would be one example in a product category that this queue that we see will benefit the customer bought on the high end as well is in the middle tier.", "Seth Sigman", "And then just a follow up on a question earlier about the clearance impact in the quarter, late last year you guys implemented a clearance module to help mitigate the impact, did that help at all this quarter or is that something we should expect to build the road this year, anymore color there would be helpful?", "Steve Barbarick", "We implemented it in Q4 and it had \u2013 again we are rolling this out, so it only impacted a very small portion of our clearance inventory, but the results we saw where positive and give us some enthusiasm as we move forward with the program. So at this point it wasn\u2019t real material in the quarter, but I can tell you that we will continue to roll forward and I suspect sometime this year we will have fully implemented the clearance price optimization program.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.", "Michael Lasser", "My first question is on the sales performance in the quarter, how would you characterize the performance relative to your expectation and what was better, was it the weather or was it share gains, was it the performance of some of your initiatives, because obviously performance was better than most, we are expecting \u2013 what I guess I\u2019m trying to understand the sustainability of it?", "Steve Barbarick", "Let me go ahead and start, this is Steve and then we\u2019ll have some follow ups potentially. I would tell you \u2013 in the opening remarks, we were really pleased with the firewall sales. It didn\u2019t come out of one specific area of sales, if you look across all of the buying teams and the categories we had, the vast majority of them had positive comp store sales. We saw good business both in all regions of the country as well as when you look at it it was pretty much well balanced across. So from that perspective, I think we also feel very good about it. And a lot of it has to do with initiatives. A lot of it has to do with new products as well as weather. So I think it was a good quarter across the board.", "Michael Lasser", "And then when you think about the weather for the rest of the year, is the first quarter tend to be \u2013 first and the second quarter tend to mean most volatile, so if it stays warmer later in the year into fall, is that less punitive to your performance of your business that if it stays colder longer into the spring?", "Anthony Crudele", "I would tell you that actually each quarter has its own uniqueness to it. As we\u2019ve said in the past and sort of mapped out a year, we like it to have a strong cold January and February, we like it to warm up in where it\u2019s possible starting in March. And then as we\u2019ve experienced in the last couple of years, the cool weather has extended the spring summer season into the July, August timeframe and that tends to be beneficial.", "As we get into the later part of the year, we like to have called the weather relatively early in the fourth quarter to generate some of the winter good sales. So that\u2019s generally the way that we look at the year. As we go into this year, making year over year and our statement that it\u2019s more normalized, we are looking at spring that\u2019s coming in the standard period of late March and April, which we did not have in the last time.", "And as we stated last year as we went through the weather, we felt that at times when you have that late spring you will miss some sales, you will pick them up later on, but you may not recapture all of the sales. So as we move through the year, we\u2019re very optimistic that with this earlier spring onslaught that we can continue to drive sales throughout the second quarter. And as we move into the third quarter, as Steve as indicated earlier, it\u2019s just a little too early to call if the early spring will mean a shortened tail compared to last year. But again we are relatively optimistic when we look at the weather patterns.", "Michael Lasser", "And then I want to circle back to the question that was asked earlier and I think there was so much detail provided on the performance of the stores in the energy producing areas, are you seeing any variability in those stores versus others?", "Steve Barbarick", "When we look at the total energy-related, so that includes oil down in the Southwest as well as some of the fracing territories, we compare those to sister stores and we do not see any significant reduction in the performance of those stores. As we carve out a much smaller group of stores relative to more Midwest and Mid Central fracing areas, we see just a slight decline, but again we see overall positive comp store sales across the board relative to that portfolio of oil/fracing stores.", "Michael Lasser", "Just to clear, so if you take out the North Dakota, Pennsylvania and just look at Texas, that\u2019s where you see a little bit weaker performance just in the Texas area, is that\u2026?", "Steve Barbarick", "Actually the opposite. And the issue is when it comes to the fracing stores, obviously we had strong comps in those stores overall. And as we continue forward, we continue to see positive comp in those stores even on a two-year stack.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take a next question from Stephen Knoll with Goldman Sachs.", "Stephen Knoll", "I wanted to just follow up on the discussion around the impact of transport on gross margin, are really able to tell us if these were unchanged year-on-year what the impact would have been on grosses?", "Anthony Crudele", "Can you rephrase that, I\u2019m not sure exactly.", "Stephen Knoll", "Sure. So you said transportation was 5 basis points favorable to gross margin driven by the decline in diesel fuel prices, but if we were to assume that diesel were flat year-on-year, would you have a sense for where you would be just driven by the stem miles in other words?", "Anthony Crudele", "We had anticipated that we would have a negative impact of somewhere between five and 15 basis points. So as we walk through it and looked at our transportation costs, I think they were extremely well-managed during the first quarter and we were able to benefit from the diesel fuel.", "But I think where you\u2019re trying to go is we\u2019re trying to look at what\u2019s the benefit over the next several quarters if diesel stays where it\u2019s at and I think we will be able to have a benefit, but what you how to take into account is the additional stores that we will be adding and the stem miles that we will be incurring. So I wouldn\u2019t say that net-net you can add 10 to 15 basis points every single quarter.", "Stephen Knoll", "And the five to 15 that you\u2019re planning that assume diesel prices being flat year on year or that\u2019s baked in some assumption for fuel price decline?", "Anthony Crudele", "It baked in some assumption of reduced fuel prices.", "Stephen Knoll", "And then just last question here, you mentioned a new demand planning system, can you frame that a little bit, tell us what exactly is changing and what the impact may be?", "Gregory Sandfort", "Let me tell you, in layman\u2019s terms, what this do for us. The demand planning format will give us a much more accurate way of forecasting forward sales based not just only on current trends and future trends, but it\u2019s reading the sales much more regularly than the other system. The other system that we got in play today is more static. It takes a snapshot pretty much of the sales on a week to week basis and it can\u2019t react as fast.", "So if we\u2019ve got something that\u2019s trending quickly, something is really selling well, we will see it in our sales, but it won\u2019t be able to \u2013 our system today won\u2019t be able to forecast that trend as it goes forward. The new demand planning system can do that for us and help us. And you can imagine with 18,000 SKUs, many of these being seasonally driven in the spring and in the fall, it\u2019s important to have some eyeballs that are on that from a system standpoint that can give us some more accurate forecasting.", "So simply put, better forecasting forward, whether it be on promotion or whether it be on a regular price sales on both, what I could call, there will a queue products and our seasonal products.", "Stephen Knoll", "And the timing of that?", "Gregory Sandfort", "We are in the first phase of rollout, it will be at least another year before we are complete with all of the departments and they are being done by division by stages. So it will be the end of 2015, early 2016 before we are complete.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Jessica Mace with Nomura Securities.", "Jessica Schoen Mace", "My first question is about some of the new stores, when you increased your long-term store target at the analyst day, you mentioned that you found we could put some stores closer together. And I was wondering if you have any results you can share with us from some of those stores opened in higher density areas or closer proximity?", "Lee Downing", "I don\u2019t know there was anything specific for you, I will tell you that our new store performance this year has been in line with what we had planned and those stores that are open closer to others are performing in line with our other new stores. So we are very confident and happy in the results that we are having from those stores. So I would say that they are in line with our other new store performance.", "Jessica Schoen Mace", "And then my other question, just wondering if you could give us an update on where you are in the process of regionalization, maybe this has a little bit to do with the demand planning, but it seems like you had a great example of having the right product in the right place for the tune of the difference and the tune of spring in the North and South. Any other opportunities that you can share with us?", "Steve Barbarick", "I will tell you that what we call localization will be an ongoing process or probably in eternity will never be right because things change and customers\u2019 demand change. Earlier in Q4, to give you one example, we recognized a need for western line of apparel in a lot of our southern stores and we added the brand Cinch for example and we put those in a number of stores thus far.", "We recognized that the productivity of that brand is incremental to what we had previously and that would just be one example of many that I could probably go through and talk about. So the team is focused on localization and see that as one of our four key sales drivers.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer", "In the prepared comments you talked about the West Coast stores achieving comp sales growth above the chain average. Does that reflect the fact that those stores are younger and therefore had the inherent sales ramp in the early years or does it just reflect that there is less direct competition in that market and there is big demand out West?", "Lee Downing", "I would tell you it\u2019s both of those things, they are performing as our new stores often do which is better than chain average and the western stores, as we said a few times, they typically run above the average of the chain. So I would say both of those things are giving us benefit.", "Dan Wewer", "And given the higher cost out West, when you look at the returns, I know it\u2019s early, but when you look at the returns in those western stores, are they generating sufficiently higher revenues to offset the higher cost structure?", "Anthony Crudele", "It\u2019s very similar to the way we model them out and they hit their pro forma numbers and they give us the expected returns based on a higher sales level and higher cost structure.", "Dan Wewer", "And then Tony I had also a follow up question for you relating to the share buyback program, given the stock is up another 15% year to date, use the outperforming the market as a whole, when you look at your metrics in buying back shares, what does your model say about how active you should be or not be at current levels?", "Anthony Crudele", "As we go into each quarter, we will adjust the model accordingly and then we will set the metrics in 10B5 plan. So as we adjust and obviously as we continue to have the sales increases and bottom line increases, it drives our calculation of the intrinsic stock value. So it will generally keep us in the marketplace throughout.", "And what the metrics really does is as the stock moves up and down between the metrics, we will adjust the number of shares that we purchase. So philosophically, we like to be in the marketplace, we like to support the stock and we believe that we\u2019re out saying that it\u2019s the time to buy the stock, we want to be in the marketplace along with our investors.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Alan Rifkin with Barclays.", "Alan Rifkin", "Greg, in the past you\u2019ve talked about the very small proportion of your customer base that uses [indiscernible] likely less than 10% of revenues and one would certainly infer that these are perhaps the small portion of your business that are commercial customers. We now have very significant deflation for six quarters and counting, how is this small segment of your customer profile performing lately?", "Gregory Sandfort", "To be honest, Alan, what we track it\u2019s not much different. We look at those customers closely than we do the rest of our portfolio, because we have more information on them. Remember, they are primarily still hobby farmers, we can\u2019t identify that they are production people, but they are in our store more regularly. So they truly are the core lifestylers. But we have not seen any drop off, as a matter of fact we talk to them on a more regular basis and we find that the more we do talk to them, the more we can bring them back into the store and their spending habits increase. So very steady. Deflation really hasn\u2019t had much of an impact either way.", "Alan Rifkin", "So no change at all on discretionary versus core products with this small group of your base?", "Gregory Sandfort", "Nothing we\u2019ve seen, no. I know it sounds too good to be true maybe, but it\u2019s true, that\u2019s how it\u2019s working for us. These customers have not changed, they are very steady.", "Alan Rifkin", "Obviously the numbers support that. And one last question if I may, obviously in this quarter it appears that you traded off a higher propensity to clearance in driving the comp, as you think about the dichotomy between those two variables going forward, are you more or less willing in the future to possibly trade margin for comp?", "Gregory Sandfort", "Let me clarify something. I think the comment about clearance is maybe being taken a little bit out of context. We had a more normal clearance cadence this year than we had in last year. We came out of 2014 very, very clean \u2013 or in 2013 into 2014 and this year I would say it was a more normalized clearance cycle. So it really didn\u2019t \u2013 it aided some in the comp, but it wasn\u2019t a major driver of comp.", "What drove the comp, as Steve had said earlier, was product across the store in many categories and it was how we had our inventories positioned north to south that really helped us drive the business. We are now a national chain, so the assortments in the Northeast can\u2019t look like the assortments in Florida.", "And we have done a fine job with our inventory management group in planning people to our sort that differently. So clearance had a very insignificant impact and overall probably a little bit a drain on margin, because the year prior we were so clean and we were actually chasing business. So we\u2019re not going to buy comps to drive to buying into clearance sales, that\u2019s not how we operate.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Omair Asif", "This is Omair Asif on for Matt. It sounds like Western stores have performed well, but as you think about continued expansion in the West and the severe drought in California and some of the other markets, does it change the return metrics of new stores at all or is it more of a function of shifting the product mix in these markets?", "Steve Barbarick", "I will start with the answer here. I would tell you that we have shifted product mix, we bought into categories we know that are going to be more related to those customers that are living out there, but I would tell you this drought didn\u2019t just happen yesterday. It\u2019s been going on now for, looking at our numbers, a couple of years now. So those stores are still performing, that\u2019s why we continue to see more opportunities upside at West. So again, I would tell you that it\u2019s just a matter of managing the mix and managing the productivity of the stores.", "Omair Asif", "And then just a follow-up, somewhat unrelated here. Can you talk broadly to some of the early responses to both the personalized marketing campaign and then the loyalty program test?", "Steve Barbarick", "I will go ahead and start with the loyalty test. At this point, we\u2019ve got our requirements together, our crack team and IT is working through the process of putting it all together for us and we anticipate doing a test in the second half of this year. So we are up and running, I think we are excited about seeing our customers\u2019 response to the program, but again it will be limited to a number of stores and we will test and learn and from there we will go forward if we think it\u2019s something that\u2019s viable.", "In terms of personalization, there is a number of activities going on. One of such is email, we had a much better response in Q1 this year with our targeted campaign versus the year prior. And we will continue to do more of that as well as personalization is one of the organization\u2019s key strategic initiatives and we\u2019ve got a team of people working on how we become more connected to our customer base.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "Couple of things. Could you just give us a little detail on the timing of the new store vendor support payments that you mentioned in the press release? And then I have a second question.", "Gregory Sandfort", "New store discount, when we open up a store, we have a program we work with the vendors as far as merchandise goes and what it is, it\u2019s really part of the inventory. So when we receive it, we capitalize it and it\u2019s earned over a period of time. So as we have stores open in the latter part of the quarter, it will benefit the following few months. So as we fine-tuned our store opening program last year, we had very limited stores opened in November and December timeframe, whereas the year before we had several stores opened in the late November timeframe. So some of those discounts get amortized into income in the subsequent quarter. So we saw that have a slight impact in Q1 this year.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "So very simple, it's a promotional payment that you don't get until you earn it, is another way to look at it, I guess. In looking at your full range of merchandise that you're moving, can you talk about, a little more specifically about trading up in categories? Do you see evidence when somebody is buying a tractor or a riding mower that they're buying a little more horsepower or a little more Helly Hansen product in the stores where that's sold or a little more Carhartt? Is any of that going on?", "Steve Barbarick", "Very good on the Helly Hansen, yes. So I would tell you that there is some of that that\u2019s taking place and you can see across different categories. I would tell you that in one case particularly, this year we are testing for example a commercial zero turn rider and it retails for nearly $6,000. And as our customers continue to see interest in stepping up, we will continue to test different products to try to accommodate their needs. So that will be just one example, but I could give you numerous examples of where we\u2019re trying to tap into that demand.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "David Magee", "I just had a question on the traffic number being so strong. I'm curious if you're seeing, or first of all, who do you think you're taking share from? It seems like the first quarter has been particularly opportunistic with regard to traffic. Who are you taking share from? And also are you seeing any sort of response that you haven't seen in the past?", "Gregory Sandfort", "I would say that number one we focus more on being better season to season, year to year in the offering to the customer. And we do that through a lot of initiatives that you\u2019ve heard about already in the call, whether it\u2019s localization or its timing of flow of product north to south because of weather and so on and so forth, I think we do that far better to do with our logistics sophistication than those who we compete with at the local to regional level.", "There is some very good competitors out there in the farm store business, don\u2019t think there aren\u2019t. But they don\u2019t have some of the capabilities that we now have as a company. So I think that\u2019s first and foremost. I don\u2019t believe that it is about who we are taking it from, I think what\u2019s happening is the consumer is deciding that we are probably a better place to shop. And I don\u2019t know specifically any particular competitor like to talk to, but we sell a number of products in that store and there is a number of other people who sell a number of those products.", "So I think the key to buy in Tractor and grow is we make it easier for the customer because we can consolidate that shopping trip under one roof in one store, we\u2019re priced right every day, we are in stock, we have great customer service, we are convenient and you can get in and get out of our stores quickly. I think there\u2019s a lot of variables out there that are playing to our favor. And we said earlier, we\u2019re relentlessly dissatisfied to keep improving and improving our business and our customer interface and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our business.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Lawrence with Stephens.", "John Lawrence", "Steve, would you comment a little bit on the May rollout of Purina and just compare and contrast number of SKUs, et cetera. Several years ago that extension of Purina was pretty positive and is the intention the same?", "Steve Barbarick", "It\u2019s a little different this time, John, and that the first time we went forward with it, it was a completely new brand to the organization and to our customer base. In this case, you are looking at probably somewhere 10 SKUs or so that are meaningful to the customer lifestyle, but a lot of those customers may still be shopping us already, because we do carry the brand. So I wouldn\u2019t expect the impact to be what we saw when we originally launched back and I believe it was 2009.", "I will tell you though that we are very excited and one of the biggest request we get from our store managers all the time are this brand and the extension of this brand. So if our team members and our customers are telling us, you know what, this could be okay and we\u2019re pretty excited about the launch.", "John Lawrence", "And follow-up: any update on the mixing center project?", "Steve Barbarick", "Mixing centers are go live, as I said, early third quarter. The test that we ran year and a half ago proved positive that we will be testing these two facilities in Texas, more to talk about once we are up and running, John.", "Operator", "We will take our next question Denise Chai with Bank of America.", "Denise Chai", "So just a big picture question to start with, how are you thinking about wage increases both in terms of the health of your customer and also from a cost perspective?", "Anthony Crudele", "We always want to be out there as far as paying a competitive wage and we think as we analyze it that we\u2019re very competitive in the marketplace. Additionally, we pay all our team members a monthly sales bonus and we think that that is an added incentive and benefit. Additionally, we hire customers and so our team members really enjoy living the lifestyle, they enjoy working with other folks and engaging with them and talking about what they are doing around their farms or out in the field.", "So we think that we have a significant advantage when it comes to working with our teams. They are very small teams, most stores at 12 to 15 folks, and we do a tremendous job in making sure that they work the expected hours. So again, I think we have significant advantage when it comes to the competitive wages that we pay our team members.", "Denise Chai", "And just going back to the new Purina feed lines, who do you compete with on this? Where are your customers currently going to get these?", "Steve Barbarick", "Purina uses their independent dealers for the most part to get distribution out to the customers. And so it\u2019s been somewhat of a dealer brand up to this point and there may be a few regional and independent farm stores that carry it, but for the most part this is incremental to Tractor Supply.", "Denise Chai", "And just last one, your new store opening this year looks somewhat front loaded. So can you give us a sense of the cadence for the remainder of the year?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes, when it comes to Q1, it is little bit frontloaded, it will slow down a little bit in Q2. So we anticipate that we will be in somewhat of a normalized cadence relative to last year where we will be about 50% to 55% of the stores will open in the first half which is similar to last year", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Joe Feldman", "Just a couple quick ones. With regard to shrink, I know you said that it was down a little bit because of the comparison was very difficult from last year. But I was curious, is there anything in particular within that that drove the shrink? And also what should we expect as the year progresses? Will it ease a little bit? If you could just remind us of that, that flow.", "Gregory Sandfort", "Joe, as you mentioned, in the prepared remarks we talked about it being a relative to last year and so it\u2019s really more of a cycle against last year\u2019s number. It is not something that\u2019s structural and it was related more to the distribution centers. So as we move forward in the year, we do not expect it to have a significant impact on the gross margin.", "Joe Feldman", "And then just one kind of minor one, but I know you'd kind of touched on the West Coast port a little bit. Can you remind me, I may have missed it, but can you quantify how much that you think the impact was from the West Coast port delays and have we fully cycled it at this point?", "Steve Barbarick", "I would tell you that based on some reporting that we\u2019ve done, it\u2019s relatively insignificant. The team did a really nice job. As we talked about earlier, we bought some product in early because of the Chinese New Year, we rerouted some of the containers along the water to other ports to get some of the access to some of that product. So we think that the impact from the sales line and the profitability line was very minimal.", "Joe Feldman", "And it sounds like the inventory that you managed pretty well and the complexion of it seems to be in pretty good shape. Is it in the right areas, the right spots?", "Steve Barbarick", "At this point we\u2019ve pretty much gotten through all of it, we\u2019ve been able to get us to the distribution network and out to the stores and we\u2019re locked and loaded for the demand.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam Sindler", "Wondering though if you've had potentially your correction of error meeting that you do after each quarter, just given everything that went right this season potentially maybe one or two examples of something that you think you potentially could have done even better.", "Steve Barbarick", "I would tell you we break our correction of error meeting into specific areas of the business and we get the owners of those business to talk to the opportunities. There is plenty of opportunities, we look forward for perfect, I would tell you in some cases we ran low or out of product where we could have been better in stock and we disappointed some customers. We know what those categories are and we got a plan to fix that for next year. And I would tell you that across the board there is plenty of opportunities, that\u2019s how I would put it.", "Adam Sindler", "And then just quickly, I did notice a pretty nice increase in payables this quarter relative to some of the past quarters. Anything different there, just maybe potentially with the timing of the new store vendor support payments or\u2026", "Anthony Crudele", "You shouldn\u2019t see any significant difference as we move forward through the course of the year.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.", "Seth Basham", "My question is around your comp average ticket trends. They seem to have slowed a little bit sequentially in terms of year-over-year growth. Just trying to get a sense of whether there's something specific behind that that you can pinpoint and your outlook for comp average ticket growth for the balance of the year.", "Anthony Crudele", "Seth, as we talked about in various different quarters, the comp ticket can be affected significantly by the big ticket purchases. Additionally, things that we mentioned just in this quarter where we had some bulk purchases in the fencing category, so there can be several different factors that will impact the average ticket. And this quarter in particular, the increase \u2013 we really were very pleased with the increase, because we like to see it coming from items per transaction versus just the ticket.", "But in this quarter in particular, big ticket did not have an impact at all on the average ticket. And we are also dealing as we have over the last couple of quarters with deflation. So between big ticket not having an impact and the deflation coming with a 80 basis point increase in the average ticket, we are extremely pleased.", "Seth Basham", "And as it relates to big ticket specifically, understand the headwinds from safes and some strength in lawn mowers, but when will that safe headwind dissipate and how do you expect big ticket to benefit or not going forward?", "Gregory Sandfort", "Let me just respond to that, because I get that question all the time internally as well. I would go as far as to say that we are still continuing to cycle some decreases from a year ago. The team is looking at where the lines from across on safes, we\u2019ve got renewed energy and are playing around that, but I don\u2019t \u2013 it will continue to diminish as a headwind. I will say that way.", "Thus far, we are still very cautiously optimistic as we go into the second quarter about big ticket. Some of that may be seasonal, some of that may be discretionary, but we are cautiously optimistic as we move into this quarter based on some of the early learnings in April.", "Operator", "This does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now pass the call back to Greg Sandfort with any additional or closing remarks. ", "Gregory Sandfort", "Thank you, operator. And thank you all for your interest and support of Tractor Supply.

Greg, please go ahead.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank Christine. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our EVP and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer. Lee Downing will not be joining us today. He is out attending a trade show.", "We had a solid second quarter and we are pleased with the continued sales trends in our business. Our merchandise planning, inventory and store teams did an excellent job of managing both product assortments and other things to deliver, both a strong sales and earnings performance for the quarter.", "Comparable store sales increased 5.6% and the increase was distributed across all of our major merchandise categories and geographic regions. We also saw growth in both traffic and ticket. Transaction counts increased 4.1% and average ticket improved 140 basis points in the quarter. And this was our 29th consecutive quarter of positive comp transaction counts. Seasonal, big ticket and C.U.E. items all performed well in the quarter and benefitted from merchandised resets and planogram updates.", "As we have discussed many times, we are a test and learn company and we are constantly evaluating and updating our product assortments to meet the needs of our customers. This year, we made some notable changes to several categories. In pet food and feed, we upgraded and expanded our assortments of premium products in equine and livestock and we added showpiece. In outdoor power equipment, we revamped with new products from Cub Cadet and Bad Boy and we introduced for the first time higher end commercial grade products in outdoor power equipment in a number of select stores. And in towing and trailer, we increased our assortment of heavy duty products and added new steel and aluminum trailers to a select number of stores. And finally in outdoor recreation, we expanded our assortment in utility and recreational vehicles.", "These changes to our assortment products demonstrate our culture of continuous improvement as part of our ongoing merch strategy. We are always testing new products and upgrading our assortments across the store to strengthen our position as the most dependable supplier of everyday basic merchandise needs for the rural lifestyle consumer.", "On the gross margin side of our business, strong execution of our price and inventory management strategies contributed to a healthy increase in overall product margins. Investments in new systems such as demand planning, inventory allocation and price optimization are enabling us to shorten the supply chain turnaround time and improve our global management of inventory.", "In regards to stores, we continue to refine our payroll allocation which we believe is allowing us to better serve our customers at peak selling periods. And while some of this resulted in higher expenses in the quarter, we remain committed to investing in the people and systems necessary to drive profitable growth over the longer term.", "Now, to update you on our omni-channel business. Last week, we launched a new and completely redesigned website. The updated site offers many enhancements to improve our customers\u2019 browsing and shopping experience. It is a responsive design that delivers the same shopping experience across all mobile devices and has improved our overall search and checkout capabilities as well as added more robust product descriptions, customer reviews and social media tie-ins.", "In regards to our supply chain activity, construction of our new distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona is on schedule and under budget and is expected to be operational late in the fourth quarter of this year. The two mixing centers in Texas are also scheduled to open in the third quarter of this year.", "We opened 17 new stores in the second quarter and remain on track to open 110 to 115 new tractor supply stores in 2015. Our western expansion continues to be a key initiative and our stores that have opened in that area over the past few years continue to comp favorably against our chain average.", "Looking ahead, we are pleased with our first-half performance and we feel positive about our positioning for the back half for the year. Along with some of the assortment changes I spoke to earlier, we continue to make strategic investments in key businesses that are important and relevant to our customers. And as a result, we made the decision to take early receipt on several categories of products that we believe will benefit our late summer and early fall selling season.", "Now let me close by thanking all of our dedicated team members across the country and all our store locations and our facilities that go the country mile for our customers each and every day. And for everyone else on the call today, we appreciate your time and interest in Tractor Supply.", "I will now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our second quarter financials. Tony?", "Tony Crudele", "Thanks Greg and good afternoon everyone.", "For the quarter ended June 27, 2015 on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 11.9% to $1.77 billion, net income grew 14.9% to $153 million and EPS increase 17.9% to $1.12 per diluted share. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our sales performance and our gross margin management during our strongest selling season.", "Comp store sales increased 5.6% in the second quarter compared to an increase of 1.9% in last year\u2019s second quarter. Comp store sales were strong across all three months of the quarter, with April and May benefitting from favorable seasonal weather and easier comparison. June also posted a solid comp, but faced tougher comparison given the back-end weighted promotional cadence of last year\u2019s second quarter. Sales were strong across all regions, with the strongest regions being the South Central and the West. Wet spring season in Texas area benefitted comps in the South Central region. Our new stores in the Western region continue to produce above chain average comp sales as they gain market awareness and share.", "Comp transaction count increased for the 29th consecutive quarter, gaining 4.2% on top of the 2.3% increase last year. Sales growth continue to be broad based as spring and year-round categories performed well. Two items such as pet food and lubricants continue to post solid comps. Key spring seasonal categories such as riding lawn mowers, trailers, and lawn and garden, and other the year-round categories such as outdoor recreation and rubber footwear performed very well.", "Average comp ticket increased by 130 basis points compared to last year\u2019s 30 basis-point decrease. Big ticket was the principal driver of the average ticket increase. Comparable sales of the big ticket items were well above the company\u2019s average for the quarter as big ticket items such as riding lawn mowers, trailers and utility vehicles all performed well. This increase was partially offset by deflation which we estimate at 20 basis points and was less than our expectation. The deflation was driven principally by livestock feed.", "Now turning to gross margin which increased approximately 50 basis points to 35.3% compared to flat last year. Although we had an easier comparison, our direct product margin was bolstered by strong price and markdown management which was facilitated by the strong sales throughout the quarter. Price management tools helped us optimize our retail pricing while negotiating lower cost in some of the deflationary categories. We believe that our gross margin and system initiatives are providing our team with better tools to drive gross margin enhancement and benefitted the quarter. Freight was favorable to 20 basis points, which was a direct result of the lower vehicle prices. The very favorable fuel price more than offset the 10 miles increase from our Western store expansion.", "We estimate that deflation had a slightly favorable impact on gross margin, this is much less impactful than the previous quarters as deflation has begun to moderate. Our gross margin improvement was even more notable as we overcame a negative mix variance of approximately 20 basis points. Strength in big ticket items which tend to carry below average gross margin was a primary driver of the negative mix impact", "Import purchases in the quarter increased 18.5% and represent 11.4% of sales mix. Also exclusive brand sales increased 9.8% compared to last year\u2019s Q2 and was approximately 30% of sales.", "For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization as a percent of sales was essentially flat compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter. SG&A growth was impacted by several factors.", "Incentive compensation had a deleveraging impact of 20 basis points as incentive compensation increased year-over-year based on the strong results of the quarter. We did allocate more payroll hours to our stores in our order to capitalize on the selling season and therefore we did not obtain the leverage we normally would receive with such a strong comp sales increase. We also experienced slightly higher payroll and rent deleveraging from new stores as they ran to maturity. This was more notable in the Western store base as we have opened over 50 stores in the past year and they generally open with a higher rent to sales ratio. The expansion of our Hagerstown DC in Q1 added incremental expense to SG&A, but we realized the cost benefits of lowers stem mile in gross margin.", "Our effective income tax rate increased 37.2% in Q2 compared to 36.7% last year, resulting from the availability of state tax incentives related to the construction of our store support center last year.", "Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of Q2, this year and last year, we had a cash balance of $56 million and no outstanding debt. During the second quarter under effective purchase program, we acquired approximately 876,000 shares for $76.6 million. We estimate that the share repurchase program for the quarter did not have a material impact on EPS.", "Average inventory levels for store increased 4.1% compared to a 3.4% decrease in last year\u2019s second quarter and inventory turns were flat compared to last year. As Greg mentioned, we made some strategic investment in key categories and took early delivery on some products to better position ourselves for the late summer and early fall season. We are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into the third quarter and we expect a normal seasonal markdown cadence.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48.2 million compared to $40.2 million last year. We opened 17 stores and closed one Del store in the second quarter compared to 23 new stores opened in the second quarter of 2014. The CapEx increase relates to the construction expenditures of our Southwest distribution center which were higher than the expenditures on our store to support center which was under construction last year at this time.", "Now looking ahead, as a result of our strong performance in the first half and as noted in today\u2019s press release, we have revised our financial expectations for the full year 2015. We now expect full year sales to range from $6.25 billion to $6.33 billion. Correspondingly, comp sales are forecasted to increase between 3.5% and 4.5%. We have increased our EBIT margin target and are forecasting 15 to 20 basis-point improvement compared to 2014. We now anticipate net income to range from approximately $412 million to $422 million, or $3 to $3.08 per diluted share. We have decreased our capital expenditure forecast for full year 2015 to a range of $220 million to $230 million. Additionally, we still anticipate that the full year tax rate will be approximately 37%. We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $137 million to $137.5 million.", "With respect to sales, we had anticipated that the first half of the year would have stronger comps than the back half as we\u2019re cycling stronger comp sales in the back half of the year. With high moister levels and mild summer temperatures, we are optimistic that the seasonal demand pattern for the third quarter will be consistent with the past two years and we will see an extended spring and summer selling season.", "Despite a difficult comparison to last year, comp sales through the first three weeks of July have been positive and are in line with our expectations. We continue to expect deflation in the back half but it has moderated more than we originally expected. We expect it to range between 30 basis points and flat, moderating as we progress through the back half of the year. We will continue to use our price management tools to drive both sales and margin while remaining focused on our goal of growing market share.", "As we look at the back half of the year, we expect a flat to slight improvement in EBIT margin driven by improved gross margin in both quarters. Our gross margin initiatives continue to drive improvement in merchandise margin and lower diesel prices should benefit freight transportation, more than our original assumption.", "We expect SG&A will run slightly higher than our original forecast and will offset the majority of the gross margin benefit in the back half. We expect SG&A to run approximately 10% to 10.5% increase over last year\u2019s back half. The key elements driving the incremental increase in our SG&A run rate include expenditures on system enhancement such as inventory allocation omni-channel, CRM and system security, additional store payroll hours consistent with the allocation we saw in the first half, rental leveraging resulting from the increased mix of new Western stores which have a higher rent to sales ratio as they ramp to maturity, and preopening expenses for our Southwest D.C. as well as the two mixing centers we plan to open in the second half.", "We\u2019re off to a strong start to the year and the team has done a great job of capitalizing on the spring season. We believe we are well-positioned to continue growing the chain while delivering mid teens EPS increases over the long-term.", "So that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll go to our first questioner now, Peter Keith from Piper Jaffray.", "Jon Berg", "This is actually Jon Berg on for Peter and congrats on the nice quarter. Just on the first question on the sustainability around the big ticket, I think you guys say comp ticket was up 1.3% which is I think five consecutive quarters now of positive comp growth. So, I guess under this context, does it seem that big ticket items are making a comeback such that there might be some sustainability as we look out to 2016 even with the tougher compares?", "Steve Barbarick", "This is Steve Barbarick. Couple of comments on big ticket, where we made changes and I think Greg noted mowers, trailers and a couple other categories like ETBs. We saw a nice impact in our business because our customers are looking for value. And when we change things we see a pretty good return. We did have categories however that fall into the big ticket I guess area that didn\u2019t perform quite as well. So while we saw a benefit in Q2, I would say that we\u2019re still cautiously optimistic and we\u2019re not going to declare victory at this point but we like what we\u2019re seeing.", "Jon Berg", "And then, as far as the impact of clearance optimization, with your gross margin up like 50 basis points and I think you cited markdown management as the driver. Are you beginning to see the early benefits of your clearance optimization software and if that is the case, are there any examples you can provide on how that clearance activity was better managed in the second quarter?", "Greg Sandfort", "The optimization on clearance is only in a select number of departments today, so it\u2019s not across all buying divisions yet. But in some areas particularly in seasonal and some of the lawn and garden, the systems have helped us enormously I would say to look at the sales trends, act appropriately and there is always, my belief that the first markdown is always the least expensive and the customer can brought to the side counter and make a purchase, typically if you\u2019re seeing some slowness in the category. So I think that the systems absolutely did help us this spring but again they\u2019re only -- it\u2019s only rolled out in certain divisions, we still have the rest of the company roll out to the year.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter Benedict", "First question, there seems to be a lot of concern around the seasonal out there in the market right now. And you guys obviously did very well in seasonal businesses, both the small ticket lawn and garden but also the larger ticket OPE. And it sounds like it was pretty consistent across the months; you said June was a little softer because you\u2019d done some promoting last year. So, I guess, I don\u2019t know, Steve, was this just a solid seasonal quarter? And do you think you guys just were taking a lot of share or do you think it -- because there was some concern about like tax with the heavy rains et cetera. So, maybe a little more color on just the seasonal business would be great. Thank you.", "Steve Barbarick", "We did go into the season really prepared and we\u2019re using inventory as a strategic lever to drive sales and take share. In terms of some of the changes we made, we worked with our vendor partners and we upgraded the specifications in a lot of the lines and using OPE as an example. With MTD for example, we upgraded the design frames and the engines and our customers voted for a lot of the categories where we made those changes. So, we were really pleased there. In terms of live goods, we\u2019re getting better at what we\u2019re doing today out in the marketplace and being more regionalized and localized. So, I would tell you, we talked about Tractor Supply and our ability to be nimble, and I think this was a really good case study in how we\u2019re able to manage through the season.", "Peter Benedict", "And then my next question would just be around the level of investment expense that you\u2019re kind of stomaching right now on some of these systems. In 2Q, I think Tony called it out as one of the pressure points in SG&A. Can you give us a sense for maybe how much larger the expense hits were maybe this quarter versus a year ago around the system? And then just maybe map out a little bit of the payback cadence from some of the larger more meaningful systems you\u2019ve got coming, the demand planning omni-channel taking some of the D.C. stuff, that\u2019s what comes to mind.", "Tony Crudele", "When we look at the investment that we\u2019re making, again we\u2019re doing our best to be methodical in how we allocate our capital. And so there was definitely a slight uptick but overall, it was really several items that impacted the expense structure in the quarter. As we mentioned, we talked a little bit about the payroll, the stores coming on board. So when it comes to the pure investment piece as we improve our systems, as we\u2019ve noted in the past, we have that investment; it\u2019s somewhat in the run rate, there was a slight uptick in the quarter but not overly significant. As we look in the back half of the year, we do have some additional investments coming forward. But again, we believe that it\u2019s something that we can absorb in the run rate as we move forward.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Hiram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.", "Cody Ross", "This is Cody Ross on for Am Rubinson today. How are you? Just a quick question regarding your supply chain. Once the West Coast D.C. is up and running at the end of this year, can we expect GMs to expand faster than the 20-25 bps that you guys had forecasted out previously?", "Greg Sandfort", "I would tell you that today we are seeing some deleveraging because of stem miles. As we open that facility, we will see some leverage from transportation, but you\u2019ve got other expenses; now, I\u2019ve got an overhead cost of a new building. So to be honest with you, the way we planned it is to be somewhat of an offset for now and then we\u2019ll learn, as time progresses I think we can have some average but it would be hard to forecast that today.", "Cody Ross", "And then just a quick update. Can you guys update us on where you stand with your royalty program and some of the capabilities you expect to have and hope to have down the line.", "Steve Barbarick", "In the back half of Q3, September, we\u2019ll be piloting our program. And I think we\u2019ve mentioned it will be in three markets. What we\u2019re looking at is a program that will have both soft and hard rewards and it will give us a chance to understand what our customers are looking at from Tractor Supply for rewards program. So, at this point, we are not really getting into a lot of the specifics. We\u2019re still working through some of the infrastructure needs that we\u2019ve got. We\u2019ll be training our team members that will be in those pilot stores here shortly and more of them likely in the next call will be able to give you all at least a little more insight as to how that program is working.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.", "Simeon Gutman", "One follow-up on gross margin Tony; thanks for some of the color on the buckets. Can you tell us I guess looking back on the promotional side? You said it was an easier comparison. How much I guess was it easier comparison cycling, either promotions or items that were sold I guess below at full margin a year ago, how much of that contributed 50 basis points?", "Tony Crudele", "If you remember last year when we talked about the second quarter, in June, we had some sort of in-store selling promotions. They were somewhat limited and the impact on gross margin really was only a few basis points, relative to this quarter.", "Simeon Gutman", "And then my follow-up on traffic, the 4% which I think is among the best in our space maybe across retail. Can you tell us how that compares, is that pretty uniform across the chain, or are you seeing mature stores versus immature stores? And then your customer frequency, are you seeing the same customer visit you more often or what is it or the other side of it is I guess, how are new customers or new customer acquisition trending?", "Greg Sandfort", "Clearly as we\u2019ve talked in the past, the newer stores will have a little bit higher transaction increase but we are seeing that there is a positive transaction increase across the chain in all maturity levels of the stores. So, as we move forward, we see that this is coming, both from increased number of visits from our current customers as well as new customers coming on board.", "Simeon Gutman", "If I can just follow up on that though, if you think about a waterfall, immature stores should be counting better, the presumption is that they should be driving better traffic. Is that the case or you\u2019re seeing some of the mature stores drive just as good traffic as some of the immature stores?", "Tony Crudele", "On an overall basis, the new stores definitely drive more transactions than the more mature stores. But we do see in different areas of the country as well as in stores that may have been renovated pr running certain tests, we\u2019ll see an uptick in comps that may be very comparable to some of the newer stores.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. ", "Seth Sigman", "I wanted to ask about the Purina expansion in the quarter; any early commentary there and any sense on how incremental the customer you\u2019re getting into the store and how we should be thinking about the ramp in the second half of the year?", "Steve Barbarick", "I\u2019d tell you that the launch of the new Purina SKUs is really the way I look at and what I told my team is it\u2019s really part of overall C.U.E strategy. What I can tell you is the SKUs that we added from Purina are C&D SKUs; we took the A&B SKUs originally when we launched in 2009. So, these SKUs are having in the impact in the rounding out the assortment hence really building some I guess credibility with our customers. There is some incrementality to it but it\u2019s not material to the top line.", "Seth Sigman", "And then just more broadly as you look at the second half comparisons, when you drill down last year you had a great second half from the ticket perspective. You talked little bit about big ticket and the potential for that continuing in the back half, but besides that anything else you can point to that should help to navigate the more difficult comparisons? I know in the past you talked a little bit gun safes and the headwind there. Is that something that\u2019s easing any other drivers there?", "Steve Barbarick", "I will say that the safe business was a headwind, a pretty significant headwind this past year and we are starting to see that moderate a little bit. I think you\u2019ve heard Tony talk a little bit about deflation and that moderating versus maybe what we\u2019re up against some last year to some extent. We are making some strategic inventory investments. And as we talked about before, we want to be a dependable supplier of basic maintenance need. So, we will be putting inventory in the key categories to drive some sales and make sure we\u2019re not going to disappoint our customers. So there is a variety of things that we\u2019re doing. We always talk about not having a silver bullet, a lot of BBs [ph] out there. And I will tell you the test and learn approach that we\u2019ve used up to this point has been working and you will likely see some new things in the store if you go visit this next quarter.", "Operator", "We will go next to Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam Sindler", "A couple of questions if I could, first is on the payroll hours, if you could just talk. So, this is something I guess we really haven\u2019t seen before but as we sort of think about how your test. Is this a test, is this something that we\u2019re rolling out, is this something that\u2019s sort of one-time and then you will start to leverage it as we go through next year? But just maybe a little more color on what the increase in store labor was and then how you are thinking about that going forward?", "Greg Sandfort", "Here is the difference. A year ago in the second quarter, we had talked about how business had been a bit sluggish. And we were really watching cost and payroll and so and so forth. So we really turned it back a bit until the sales started to come late second into third quarter. This year, we saw a more normalized second quarter and we felt as if it was prudent to go ahead and leave the payroll as we had planned and in some instances we added some payroll to take advantage of the sales trends and the customer transactions. So, that\u2019s what the basic difference. If you compare year-to-year, it\u2019s kind of an odd comparison because the seasons were very, very different.", "Adam Sindler", "So, as we look at the third quarter then, with the third quarter having the extended selling season last year, should we look for a little bit more normalized labor in the third and fourth quarters?", "Greg Sandfort", "Yes, I believe so. And I think it would be very comparable to a year ago.", "Adam Sindler", "And just as we think about the third quarter, can you just remind us about the cadence last year, sort of the July, August, September, how those months comps?", "Tony Crudele", "Sure, this is Tony. We generally don\u2019t give specifics on the months but I will tell you that the months were very consistent relative to the overall comp for the quarter last year.", "Operator", "We will go next to Michael Lasser with UBS.", "Michael Lasser", "On your expectations for the back half of the year, may be you can -- the comp here [ph] is a little confusing, you mentioned flat. Maybe you can provide a little bit more -- clearer picture of how you are thinking about the breakdown between the third and the fourth quarter on a comp perspective?", "Tony Crudele", "As is our standard, we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance and we provide full year guidance. So, the overall comment is that we expect that the full year comp will be between 3.5% and 4.5%. Obviously running a 5.5%, there is clearly a range for the back half that obviously -- it\u2019s up to you guys and your modeling to determine. But we feel very comfortable within that 3.5% to 4.5% range on a full year basis.", "Michael Lasser", "And maybe you could just give us some of the puts takes on what sort of pushed you towards the higher end of the range and what sort of pushed you towards the lower end of the range. So, is it going to be heavily weather dependent or is the back half a little less influenced by the weather than the first half of the year?", "Tony Crudele", "Well generally, the back half is less influenced by weather than the first half of the year. I would say as we look out into the second half, sort of that extended spring summer consistent with last year will be critical to third quarter. And as in the past, the earlier we have a nice cool seasonal winter coming on board that generally drives some of the heating product and some of the winter product and insulated outerwear and that tends to be the main driver in the fourth quarter as well.", "Michael Lasser", "And my last question is on the West Coast stores. In the past, you\u2019ve mentioned that they\u2019re higher volume but it sounds like they are also now faster growing. So is that pretty consistent quarter in quarter out or you are seeing an acceleration at this point?", "Tony Crudele", "I would answer that it\u2019s been relatively consistent. What we\u2019ve seen is that we will have a slightly higher sales volume and the ramp will be generally consistent with a new store. However we will have some acceleration because they tend to be a little bit of a higher volume store. What we\u2019ve seen and the point we\u2019re making in the comments was that generally in modeling the West stores, we will have a higher rent to sales relationship or ratio in the first couple of years of that store\u2019s growth. And then as we continue to ramp because they are a little bit higher in sales volume, then we will start to get the leverage that we expect out of the Western stores. So, slightly different ramp than the rest of the chain but for the most part, consistent with our new store performance. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs.", "Stephen Tanal", "I wanted to focus a little bit on gross margin and just sort of understand kind of what really contributed what. I mean the price management and markdown management, can you talk a little bit about those maybe independently, maybe not to the extent that they are related and kind of frame and relative to the overall increase year-on-year?", "Tony Crudele", "We tend not to give too much detail relative to each factor when it comes to gross margin because many of these factors interrelate and so it\u2019s hard to call it out each one. We gave somewhat specifics on the fuel component which was a major driver. So, we can carve that out pretty well, so it was around the 20 basis-point mark. Then when it comes to price management and deflation, again that\u2019s very difficult to sort of parse those two pieces out. Now, what we did see is that as we\u2019ve had some cost decreases, we have been able to manage our retail prices very effectively. And so, a good portion of that increase in margin is really related to price management component. So, if you wanted me to outline the two big drivers, I would say is the fuel component and the price management piece was the two principal drivers of the margin improvement.", "Stephen Tanal", "I was sort of thinking about back half and what it could like, specifically clearance optimization is one thing I was thinking about and you noted the big benefit it\u2019s had in seasonal and garden. And then I am wondering what are the categories are -- said another way, will all categories be kind of on that program by year-end; is that the right timing for this? And maybe you could help us sort of think about kind of the relative impact in the quarter versus what\u2019s still to come on that initiative?", "Steve Barbarick", "I would tell you that we\u2019re still rolling this program out and we\u2019re still going through a season right now. So, a lot of the categories that we put in to our clearance price optimization tool are spring related categories. And what we saw was the system said, we be better off taking some early marks in a number of these categories because we think we could see some benefit on the back side. But we haven\u2019t yet got to the full season yet to see this all way through. That\u2019s the way the tool is designed. So rather than in the past where we were taking more global markdowns, these markdowns are taken as a site level based on sales rate and inventory levels. So we do think that there\u2019s going to be some nice benefit, but until we get to the season, that would be hard for us to put too much into this. We\u2019ll be able to communicate better probably at the end of next quarter and share with you what we experienced here in spring.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Mark Miller with William Blair.", "Mark Miller", "One of the things that\u2019s most impressive to me about Tractor Supply is the diversification of gross margin drivers and from semester to semester, it\u2019s shifting and obviously the price and markdown optimization here. But I was hoping you can talk a little bit about what\u2019s coming with the demand planning system, the timing of when we might begin to see those benefits kick-in and how we can dimensionalize the size of that potential opportunity?", "Greg Sandfort", "Let me talk to this a little bit. Demand planning is a roll out over really the next year, year and a half and its basic component is to help us looking forward demand for product whether it would be at regular price selling or at promotional price selling. And instead of us having kind of what I would call these peaks and valleys with inventory, it\u2019s looking out forcing us -- and forcing the system to say, we -- it estimates x amount of demand is coming because it knows more, it\u2019s -- the inputs that go into this are different than the inputs that go into E3 which is somewhat of a basic kind of a static replenishment system. This is much more sophisticated than anything we\u2019ve had. We are learning right now. We\u2019ve had several departments that have been turned on. So far we\u2019re seeing fairly good results. We\u2019re bringing inventory levels down and we\u2019re seeing some positive comp sales in those categories over their comparison store groups. So like-stores-to-like-stores we\u2019re seeing improvement. But it is a -- it\u2019s truly a test and learn process over the next 18 months but very encouraged with the initial reporting that\u2019s coming from it.", "Mark Miller", "So where the organization could see the biggest uplift it sounds like through next year, but really \u201817, \u201818 potentially?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, it\u2019s going to be a bit of a maturing process. So yes, I would say it\u2019s a good year out before we\u2019re really going to see a lot of the benefit.", "Mark Miller", "And then on the exclusive products, you\u2019ve had tremendous success there historically; it looks like its plateaued recently, but some of that is because you\u2019re getting such strong sales elsewhere, so I mean big ticket and other. But what are the top priorities for exclusive products going forward?", "Steve Barbarick", "Exclusive brands continue to be a focus for us. Part of what you\u2019re seeing in the top-line numbers is a bit of a byproduct of deflation. So, we\u2019re still seeing nice growth there, but as our costs have come down in some of our key businesses, we\u2019re not getting necessarily the benefit on the top-line and therefore the mix is changed. So, I would tell you the engine is still running. And what you\u2019re seeing in the margin line, some of that is a byproduct of full deflation and what we\u2019re doing as far as bringing more products into the exclusive brand family.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Tony, it seems like you guys have accelerated your reset activity over the last certainly several quarters and it sounds like they\u2019re generating very good results. Can you give us some additional color on the difference in sales performance between categories, in general I guess but between categories that have been reset or re-merchandised and those that may not have been touched quite as much?", "Steve Barbarick", "What I can tell you is as I\u2019ve been with the company, this is my I guess 17th, 18th year and we\u2019ve always been a company that\u2019s focused on resetting merchandise and bringing new things into the center core of our stores. I will say that we continue to put different levels of scrutiny on the reset activity we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re using a tactics model going back to little bit of the data or science driven part of our business. Where we do resets they vary. In some cases, we\u2019ll do resets to bring new products in or we\u2019ll try to keep our assortments fresh; other cases, it maybe to leverage cost because of multisource products out there. So, it\u2019s really hard to say specifically when you do a reset that they all are going to give you 10% comp sales increases. But what I can say, they vary dramatically. And generally speaking, we see a nice comp as a result of the activity that we do. That\u2019s why we keep doing it.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "And you guys have certainly emphasized that in various categories this is what changed; this is why we re-merchandised, you got a nice flip from it. Is there any way to provide it and maybe there is and maybe there isn\u2019t, maybe the results are just too bad?", "Steve Barbarick", "Well, you have to understand, a large part of the store gets reset. And as a byproduct of that, it varies by category. So we talk winches before and the winch line has performed really significantly well. We\u2019ve recently looked at our power tool assortment and expanded a line in the vault and we think that our customers will respond favorably and the initial read looks that they will. And I could go into the pet food line where we expanded premium categories such as Blue Buffalo and others. So, it\u2019s really different by category but I can tell you, we\u2019re putting more scrutiny into the work that goes into the reset and making sure that we\u2019re trying to bring cost down while bringing good quality products and value to our consumers and they seem to be responding favorably that\u2019s probably the best I can answer to that.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "And then just a quick, hopefully it\u2019s a quick question. We have heard about incremental sales challenges from a lot of retailers around energy intensive market, I don\u2019t think you guys mentioned anything that on the call and obviously it didn\u2019t seem to impact the total top line. But I would think a bunch of your products would be susceptible to the slowdown in some of these oil and gas markets. Have you seen any of that kind of impact?", "Steve Barbarick", "What I can tell you is, in those oil drilling store specifically and again you have to remember there just part of a much bigger chain of stores. And those subset of stores, there are some categories that you are seeing comp sales declines in. We\u2019ve seen them in truck boxes and fuel handling, we\u2019ve got local assortments for these stores in fire retardant apparel and those are seeing some declines. But if you look at the total store, we\u2019re a needs based retailer and we carry so many more products than those areas that just relate to oil that we\u2019re seeing nice comp store sales in those stores themselves. So, it\u2019s not material to the top line at this point, you can see that in overall company numbers.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Incorporated.", "Ben Bienvenu", "So just quickly on tickets, obviously big ticket sales was a key driver for the higher ticket in the quarter. But did you all -- I\u2019ve been curious to know if you also saw a lift in items per transaction. And if so, what do you think is the driver for this, is it better assortment, healthier customer, what could be factoring into that?", "Tony Crudele", "When we look at the ticket, obviously a substantial portion was driven by big ticket. But we also look on an items per transaction basis. We did have a very nice lift there as well. And again, when you\u2019re dealing with some small numbers and like 3.5 items per transaction, when you move to 3.6 that\u2019s a nice move. So, it\u2019s still a very small number of items per transaction but we did have a nice lift. And I think as you commented, there is just several factors that go on, a lot of what Steve has been talking about as far as our enhanced assortment. We\u2019ve done a great job of making the store more shopable, picking up new products, the operations team get the credit about having items of the month and making sure that they drive that basket. So, I think it\u2019s a combination of several factors and it is something that we continue to focus on.", "Ben Bienvenu", "Secondly, looking to Home Town Pet, are there any learnings there that you\u2019ve seen that could be promising in the Tractor Supply store, anything jump out you there?", "Greg Sandfort", "What I will tell you is that we have two stores up and running; we have been -- we\u2019re about in our ninth month now of operation and we are seeing a little different mix of sales in those stores versus the Tractor, which means that it\u2019s attracting in our opinion little different customer and there are some learnings. I\u2019ll give you one and I won\u2019t speak to too many but I\u2019ll give you one. We have services in these stores that we don\u2019t have in a Tractor Supply and what I mean by that is the grooming salon. The grooming salon has taught us a number of things, one that if a great groomer, they can bring traffic to that store. And unlike other grooming salons, we allow our groomers to step outside the salon, if they find that the animal that they\u2019re grooming has a need for something whether it would be for their coach or they\u2019ve got hot spots whatever, we allow our groomers to go out on the floor and actually suggest to sell to the customer, a product that could be a solution. So, it\u2019s a little more intimate relationship in our store than you may find in other side operations. But that\u2019s an example of something that we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019re looking and saying to ourselves, \u201chmm, is that something that is potentially an expansion point for Tractor someday?\u201d", "Operator", "We\u2019ll got next to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard", "I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color, you talked about the early receipt or strategic early receipt of some inventory to be better prepared, it sounds like for the late summer early fall. Just talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re specifically doing there, why you haven\u2019t done it in the past? There\u2019s something that enables you to do it now and what you think the payback from that can be?", "Steve Barbarick", "A couple of things here. I think even I talked a while back about the fact that as an organization we\u2019re going to start using inventory to really help propel sales and to really make us more of a dependable supplier of basic maintenance needs. When we came out of Q2 last year, we were running a comp inventory decrease and this year that increase that you saw partly kind of built back up the hole that we have put ourselves in. But I can tell what we\u2019re bringing in to make sure that we make the right commitment to our customers, will be heating; we\u2019re going to be bringing that in to make sure that we locked and loaded for the season. What we typically find is when there\u2019s a cold winter the season before, customers tend to want to get out early because last year they got caught short and maybe weren\u2019t able to get the goods that they needed. So, no different than we did last year but maybe at a little higher level, we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re in the heating business and that includes fuel, making sure that we got our coordinates set when it comes to apparel and everything else laid out. So, we did get some early receipts in, we will be setting our stores here shortly. And when customers come in they\u2019re going to know that we\u2019re ready for the season. We\u2019re going to be there to take care of their needs.", "Eric Bosshard", "And then secondly and I know that you operate across a number of different categories and perhaps even industries, but in as much as you have a feel for market share or a feel for your customers, you feel like your share of wallet is growing at a similar pace to the past or if there\u2019s a change taking place that you\u2019re getting better penetration with your customers gaining market share, any sense on that?", "Greg Sandfort", "Let me make a couple of statements real quick. Number one, the consumer continues to spend their hard earned dollars in the same way. They\u2019re looking for good value, our consumers are continuing to spend on need based products, less discretionary. I would say that with the kind of unit increases that we are experiencing in a number of categories both in C.U.E and in some other seasonal categories, I have to believe that there\u2019s a market share that\u2019s probably shifting to us. But there are so many that it\u2019s very difficult with all these categories to be able to pull some data. The data that we get is basically from our suppliers talking about of how much of their business is coming from Tractor Supply, so the answer there would be, I believe we are getting more share and I think our share of wallet is increasing.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matt Nemer", "I was just curious if we are seeing a more sustained shift to big ticket and you didn\u2019t say that. But if that happens, does that drive payroll hours on a more sustained basis, is there more training and assembly and selling that takes place that would more permanently drive payroll hours?", "Tony Crudele", "Seasonally where we would incur the most hours would be in Q2 as we have the spring season. So, as we move forward, it\u2019s less of an impact; big ticket has less of an impact on our payroll allocation.", "Matt Nemer", "And then I guess secondly and maybe this already came up but did you just explain the change in the CapEx guidance for the year.", "Tony Crudele", "No, I did not give the details. Generally, it relates to several factors across the board. We are under budget as Greg has mentioned on our Southwest distribution centre that\u2019s probably the largest piece of the decrease. Some of the IT initiatives are coming in on plan and on the budget as well as some initiatives we may not get to. And so as usual at the beginning of the year, we have little bit greater appetite for some of the key projects but the majority is the result of being under budget on some of the key initiatives that we\u2019ve executed so far this year.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to David Magee with SunTrust.", "David Magee", "I had a question regarding some of the resets in terms of the upgrades that you\u2019re showing success with. I\u2019m curious if you think you could have done this years ago or is this a reflection of the economy or the ability to manage with the systems more effectively?", "Steve Barbarick", "I would tell you that it\u2019s probably as much to do with relentlessly satisfaction. We\u2019ve always done resets. We haven\u2019t really talked a whole lot about them on the call. For those of you who attend our IR conference, where we\u2019ve got our sales meeting, you see a lot of the changes that take place with our vendors on the sales floor down there at the convention center. So, I think that this has been an ongoing thing for Tractor Supply. And I think you go back and you look at our traffic count, you look at our comp store sales performance, you\u2019ll see that in a lot of the numbers. We\u2019re just probably today giving more color around some of the changes we\u2019re making. I will say however that when it comes to some maybe more of the commercial product, we are testing more there than we have in the past and it seems to be resonating pretty well with our customers. The higher price points that we have out there right now and how we\u2019re selling those price points, I think are real show of support from our customers and their trust in the Tractor Supply brand and also their trust with the team members that we have in our stores and relationships they\u2019ve built.", "So, I think we are taking advantage quite frankly of a foundation that\u2019s been built for years and we\u2019ll continue to try and test new things.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Denise Chai with Bank of America.", "Denise Chai", "I apologize for the background noise here. You talked about comp sales decrease [ph] the Western stores and the chain average. Is that more a function of just store maturity or is it related to the competitive environment there?", "Tony Crudele", "Denise it really relates more to the maturation cycle of our new stores. We believe that in several of the areas it is very competitive out there. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re extremely pleased with the ramp of the stores out West and sort of that accelerated comp that we\u2019re experiencing with those Western stores.", "Denise Chai", "And recently corn and soy have moved up quite a lot. I just wonder if these prices hold, when you would expect to see those come true in your kind of inflation or deflation numbers.", "Tony Crudele", "We\u2019ll likely see, if these hold and as our costs pick up, we\u2019ll see it start to moderate at the end of Q3 and end of Q4, but again we\u2019re still watching that very closely and our teams are challenged to keep costs down. So we\u2019ll see how good negotiators they are.", "Denise Chai", "And just one more; you talked a lot about the new kind of commercial and professional level tools that you got in to store. Were those contributors to your strong ticket this quarter or is it just kind of too early to see their impact and ticket was more a function of big ticket items?", "Tony Crudele", "I would say that the upgrades that we made when it comes to engines that are in the same size more but by changing the deck style and the frame as well as upgrading the engines, if you want to call that commercial, I guess you could but our customers tend to like things of high quality when they can see value and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll continue to focus on. I\u2019ll use one other quick example and that is as we added 59 99 [ph] commercial zero turnover into a handful of stores and at the beginning of the season we saw it performing really well and we expanded it out to even in more stores and we were delighted with the sales. And to be able to sale $6,000 riding mower in a Tractor Supply Company store something that I wouldn\u2019t have thought we could have done years ago. So there is a need and I think we\u2019re feeling that need in that gap really well.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Joe Feldman", "I wanted to just ask again another update on the online business. And I know it\u2019s still small and emerging, but are you seeing any deference in customer or what people are purchasing, or how far people are shipping from the store or if there is a demand for pick at store; buy online, pick up the store that kind of thing?", "Steve Barbarick", "We\u2019re seeing a lot of positive signs. So the comp ramp there is far greater than we\u2019ll have in our four wall stores, because it\u2019s still a very immature business, but no question with the new website launch. The reason we did that was to give customers more options. As far as the way to acquire the product, our goal is to do 24/7 Tractor. So in order to do that we had to do the upgrades and give ourselves the ability to have a platform that can handle that. We are adding more and more drop ship vendors as we speak daily. We are seeing very good customer response to those additions and more of our business is coming from that element today than probably I would say direct fulfillment; it\u2019s coming greater than what we\u2019ve seen in just normal replenishment from the Franklin D.C. which is kind of the replenishment point for the online business. So, we are encouraged with that because that\u2019s a direct connection between us and the drop ship from the vendors, so lowest cost for us, little faster delivery for them.", "But in general, our conversion rates are moving upward, the amount of people that are hitting the website is increasing. We are looking at adding new extensions of products. So, you are going to see this thing develop over the next several years and it\u2019s something that I think can be much more meaningful. However I will caution you, there are a lot of things that we saw at Tractor Supply that would be very difficult to sell online and deliver to customer because of their cost of transportation. So, there will be a point when there is going to be some things it could be somewhat prohibitive but all indications, all signs right now are that this thing is moving ahead well and we are very pleased with our performance.", "Joe Feldman", "And just a quick follow-up on where orders are originating, like are you seeing a big increase in mobile? Obviously you said you guys revamps on the mobile side and\u2026", "Greg Sandfort", "Mobile is growing very rapidly, Joe. And the consumer who is buying from us is still somewhat within a proximity of our store base. So when I am seeing someone in some distant place and let\u2019s say Alaska trying to buy product on tractorsupply.com that has not been prevalent; it\u2019s been customer that are looking at that as a convenient factor, they can buy at 3:00 in the morning and then they buy at 6:00 o\u2019clock in the evening that\u2019s what we\u2019re saying. So, it\u2019s really still somewhat based around the current consumer base, the distance of our stores that\u2019s what the base of business is coming from.", "Joe Feldman", "And if I could sneak one more quick one, As far as new stores and real estate the outlook, are you finding any differences in procuring new sites or cost of rent or the new sites going up at all or anything to note on the real estate front?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well one thing we have noticed and I mentioned it in the write ups, Tony commented it too that it\u2019s a little more expensive to do business in the West, no question that occupancy costs are higher but our retails are different out there and the volume of those stores will be considerably different. So, we are finding plenty of sites, it doesn\u2019t seem to be any concern for finding quality sites. But one thing I should mention is when we open stores, we don\u2019t look at as just opening the all A locations. We will open stores across the spectrum of small, medium and large in volume and in size so that we can continue to see productive store opening improvements over the next decade or so of store growth. So we\u2019re not looking at just A stores, we\u2019re looking at A, Bs and Cs. We are looking at different markets, some larger, some smaller. The mix of stores is just as important as finding a location of that store.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Jessica Mace with Nomura Securities.", "Jessica Mace", "My question was on new customer acquisition. You mentioned some of the learnings from the HomeTown Pet format. And I was just wondering about the process of applying those learnings for the Tractor Supply format as well as any other opportunities you see for increasing business with new customers?", "Greg Sandfort", "Jessica, let me just comment on HTP and I\u2019ll let Steve take it from the other side. In HTP, we can attribute generally all of our customers that are coming through from a purchasing standpoint because it\u2019s a different format; it\u2019s very intimate, they are willing to give us their information so on so forth, little different in Tractor however.", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes, Jessica, what I would tell you is that acquisition of customers is critically important. We talk a lot about the who are non-shopper and we talk a lot about how difficult sometimes it is to get people in our stores that just look at the name Tractor Supply. We have done a lot with our assortments over time. We have done some different things with our marketing and how we target different areas. So, I would tell you that we\u2019re making good strides. I would tell you by the top transaction growth we are continuing to see that in our numbers. And so while there\u2019s more work to be done here, I am pretty pleased with the degree of support that we are getting from our marketing team and bringing new folks in.", "Jessica Mace", "And then just a quick follow up on the performance of the exclusive brands. You mentioned deflation as one of the dynamics that was causing some of the difference in the performance of the exclusive brands versus the remainder of the offering. Is there anything else to think about or may be expectations for the back half?", "Steve Barbarick", "I would tell you deflations had the biggest impact. So whether it would be in our brands like Royal Wing or Bird Seed or some of what you are saying on the livestock feed side of our business, we are selling some good units. We continue to think that we are gaining share. Units are a focus for us but it is difficult when you\u2019re paddling uphill here because the deflation on the top-line. So, it\u2019s still a focus for us as an organization and that\u2019s what I can tell you at this point.", "Operator", "That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Greg Sandfort for any additional or closing remarks.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you for your interest everyone and your support of Tractor Supply. We look forward to speaking to you again in October regarding our third quarter performance.", "Operator", "This does conclude the conference.

On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Steve Barbarick, EVP and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Lee Downing, our EVP of Store Operations and Real Estate.", "We are really pleased with the overall performance of our business in third quarter. From a top line perspective we face our most difficult comparison of the year in this quarter. If you recall, an extended spring-summer selling season combined with earlier cold weather made for a solid third quarter in each of the past two years. Our teams did an excellent job of positioning the business for both top and bottom line growth in the quarter with comparable sales increasing 2.9% and earnings per share increasing 16%.", "Comp store sales growth was driven by strength in everyday in spring-summer seasonal category with consumable, usable and edible items such as pet food and supplies and livestock continuing to perform well in the quarter. Even though the spring-summer seasonal business started earlier this year, we did see a modest tailwind to categories in this business into the third quarter that resulted in solid sales of items such as trailers, fencing and outdoor recreation products.", "We did not experience early demand for cold weather seasonal items as in the previous two years. This primarily impacted the sale of fuel and heating related products such as wood pellets, logs splitters, indoor fireplaces and wood burning stoves. We understand that our customers purchase these items based primarily on need and as the winter season progresses we expect this business to improve. We obviously cannot predict weather but it is our job to be ready for our customers with the right assortments of cold weather seasonal products when the demand arises and we will be ready.", "Last quarter we discussed a number of merchandise resets as part of our test and learn continuous improvement culture. We continue to use PoS and planogram data along with store, customer and vendor research to refine and improve our store assortments. We are committed to ongoing merchandise improvements and with the exception of heavy winter related items, all of our major departments continue to contribute positive sales in the quarter.", "In September, we held annual Pet Appreciation Week or PAW event. This is a week-along event in all of our stores and online. This centers around pet adoption and pet health. We partner with local agencies and community groups to promote pet adoptions and this year's event resulted in nearly 2500 pet adoptions across our store base. Additionally, we continued to improve the event through extensive digital support including the third Annual Rescue Your Rescue contest to fund animal shelters. Pet and animal related products are important and growing portion of our business and the PAW event is just another way we drive sales, support and awareness at the local level. And this year's event was another success and continues to position Tractor Supply as a leading authority in pet food and pet care.", "Also this month we launched Flocktoberfest, a new event in stores and also online. This is a month long celebration featuring our feathered friends in our poultry and wild bird categories. In conjunction with the event, we launched a new line of premium wild bird seed labeled totaled care as a sub-brand under our exclusive brand of Royal Wing brand bird products. As always here at TSC, we continue to test and learn from our customers utilizing new product introductions and extensions. This program is just another example of this successful strategy in motion.", "In the quarter we also began a test of our customer loyalty program, Neighbors Club, in approximately 140 stores. We ask our customers to provide their contact information at checkout and opt in to receive special promotions and updates on merchandise and in-store related events. As with everything we do, we will be measured and disciplined in our testing and eventual rollout of this program. We have a strong and loyal customer base at Tractor Supply and we are excited to learn more about their preferences and shopping needs through our Neighbors Club program. Initial feedback and enrollment rates from the customers we have seen thus far are promising.", "As I mentioned last quarter, we launched a new and completely redesigned Web site. The new Web site is a more responsive design that delivers the same shopping experience across all mobile devices. The site improves search and checkout capability and provides better product descriptions, customer reviews and social media tie-ins. We continue to increase the merchandise offerings on our site and now have over 125 vendors in our drop ship program.", "During the third quarter we opened our first two mixing centers in Texas. These are smaller cross-stocking style distribution facilities that handle many of our palletized products such as riding lawn movers and faster turning queue items such as feed, animal bedding and grass seeds. With our vendors delivering products directly to these mixing centers, we are shortening the supply chain replenishment time and distance to stores and lowering our in-store inventory levels while improving in-stock levels. Thus far we are pleased with the initial results.", "Construction of our new distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona is complete and finished on time and under budget. The facility began receiving inventory in early October and is on schedule to began shipping to stores in December. Over time, this distribution center will have the capacity to service upwards of 250 stores in the southwest region. And lastly, we opened 30 new stores in the quarter and remain on track to open approximately 114 new Tractor Supply stores in 2015. Our western expansion continues to be a key initiative and our stores that have opened in that region over the past few years continue to comp favorably against our chain average.", "In closing, I want to say thank you to all of our dedicated team members in our stores, the merchandising innovation center, our distribution facilities and our store support center. I realize that I comment on this a lot but it really is our people that set us apart and they drive the success, innovation and unique culture we have here at Tractor Supply. I will now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our third quarter financials.", "Tony Crudele", "Great. Thanks, Greg and good afternoon everyone. For the quarter ended September 26, 2015 on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 8.5% to $1.48 billion, net income grew 14% to $87.3 million and EPS increased 16.4% to $0.64 per diluted share.", "Comp store sales increased 2.9% in the third quarter compared to increase of 5.6% in last year's third quarter. Similar to last year, good ground moisture and mild temperatures helped to extend the spring and summer selling season into the July and August timeframe. Key core categories performed very well such as the animal and pet categories and key seasonal categories such as fencing, trailer and outdoor recreation.", "As we moved through September, we did not experience the cold weather trends in the north that drove early fall and winter sales last year. Additionally, since we were coming off our second consecutive cold winter season, we believe customers did not have the same sense of urgency for pre-seasonal winter purchases as they did the year before. As a result, cold weather categories such as heating and power equipment did not perform to our expectations and negatively impacted comp sales.", "Sales were solid across all regions except for the northeast and upper Midwest as they did not benefit from the colder weather as I just mentioned. Our new stores in the western region continue to product above chain average comp sales as they gain market awareness and share. Comp transaction count increased for the 38th consecutive quarter gaining 3.8% on top of a 3.3% increase last year. Comparable transactions were driven by continued strength of our queue items and the strong performance of the spring-summer seasonal categories.", "Average comp ticket decreased by 90 basis points compared to last year's 220 basis point increase. Big ticket was the principal driver of the average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items were down low single digits year-over-year as soft sales of winter seasonal items such as heating stoves and log splitters were only partially offset by the strength in sales of trailers and utility vehicles. We estimate that deflation was approximately 25 basis points which also contributed to the decrease in the average ticket. The deflation was driven principally by livestock feed and lubricants.", "Now turning to gross margin, which increased approximately 60 basis points to 34.7% compared to last year's decrease of 30 basis points. While we had an easier comparison versus last year's third quarter gross margin decrease, our direct product margin was bolstered by strong price and markdown management. Price management tools continued to help us optimize our retail pricing while negotiating lower cost in some of the deflationary categories. Freight was favorable by six basis points which related to lower diesel prices. The favorable fuel price more than offset the stem mile increase from our western store expansion. The variance was not as favorable as Q2 as we had a merchandise mix shift to more freight intensive product in the third quarter.", "The mix of merchandise did not have a significant impact on gross margin as the favorable gross margin impact from softer big ticket sales was offset by strong sales in animal feed and pet food which are below chain average margin categories. We estimate the deflation only had a slight favorable impact on gross margin as deflation continues to moderate in the feed category. Import purchases in the quarter increased 16.6% and represented 11.2% of the sales mix. Also the exclusive brand sales increased to 8.2% compared to last year's Q3 and was approximately 31% of sales.", "For the quarter SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 25.3% of sales, an increase of 10 basis points over prior year's quarter. We are very pleased with our payroll management in Q3 as the team reacted well and allocated payroll with the sales trend. We did incur startup expenses for our southwest distribution center and the two mixing centers. We estimate six to seven basis points of SG&A expense related to the startup cost. The expansion of Hagerstown DC in Q1 added incremental expenses to SG&A but we realized the cost benefit of lower stem miles in gross margin.", "We also experienced slightly higher rental leverage from the new stores as they ramped to maturity. This was driven primarily by the western store openings, which as we have discussed, generally opened with higher rent to sales ratio. With the opening of over 40 western stores in the past year, this continues to impact SG&A. Incentive compensation had minimal year-over-year impact on SG&A leverage. The year-over-year percent increase in SG&A was approximately 9% in the third quarter which was lower than our year-over-year increase in Q1 and Q2. As a reminder, the third quarter last year was impacted by expenses related to the move to our new store support center.", "So this along with onetime expense savings this year, made for a favorable comparison in Q3. Our run rate in Q4 is expected to be more consistent with the first half of the year. Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q3 we had cash balance of $51.4 million and $190 million outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $47.5 million and $150 million in outstanding debt at the end of last year's third quarter. During the third quarter, under our stock repurchase program we acquired approximately 1.4 million shares for $119.4 million. Average inventory levels per store increased 1.6% compared to a 3.7% increase in last year's third quarter and annualized year-to-date to inventory turns decreased one basis points compared to last year as a result of the softer pre-season sales of cold weather items.", "We exited the spring-summer season with the normal seasonal markdown cadence. We continue to make investments in key inventory categories and we have brought several fall winter categories in early and are prepared for the season. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66.5 million compared to $43..3 million last year. We opened 30 stores and closed two Del stores and one Tractor Supply store in the third quarter compared to 30 new stores opened in the third quarter of 2014. The CapEx increase relates to the construction expenditures of our southwest distribution center which were higher than the expenditures on our support center which was completed last year at this time.", "So looking ahead. Based upon third quarter results and as noted in today's press release, we have tightened the ranges of our financial expectations for the full year 2015. We expect full year sales to range from $6.28 billion to $6.33 billion. Full year comp sales are forecasted to increase between 4% and 4.5%. We are forecasting a 20 to 25 basis point improvement to our EBIT margin compared to 2014. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $413 million to $420 million or $3.02 to $3.08 per diluted share. Our capital expenditure forecast for full year 2015 remains $220 million to $230 million. We expect to finish the year with approximately 114 new stores.", "Additionally, we anticipate the full year tax rate will be approximately 37%. We will continue to make purchases under the share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 136.5 million to 137 million. Principally as a result of the share repurchases made year-to-date under our program, we expect that we will have an outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility of approximately $100 million to $150 million at year end. Our sales outlook is cautious based on the fact that weather and oil prices can impact sales this time of year.", "Last year we had a colder than average November and a warmer than average December. This year we expect that to flip and anticipate the impact will be neutral. Additionally, with the relatively low heating oil prices, there could be less consumer demand for wood burning stoves and some of heating and fuel categories. We have seen in the early part of the fourth quarter as the weather turns cold, that consumer response to our winter seasonal assortment. As in the past, our merchant team has been nimble and adjusting to weather shifts and we are confident that our team has put together a great plan to drive winter seasonal merchandise when the cold weather arrives.", "In the fourth quarter we expect deflation to continue to moderate and we will continue to use our price management tools to drive both sales and margin while remaining focused on our goal of growing market share. We expect EBIT margin in the fourth quarter to be slightly down with a modest increase in gross margin to be offset by SG&A deleverage. Our gross margin initiatives continue to drive improvement in merchandising margin and lower diesel prices should benefit freight transportation. As I mentioned earlier regarding SG&A, the third quarter this year benefitted from the comparison to last year's lease write-offs and accelerated depreciation relative to our store support center move.", "We expect SG&A run rate in the fourth quarter to be more consistent with the first half of the year and estimate SG&A increase in the range of 10% in the fourth quarter. The key elements driving the incremental increase in our SG&A run rate results principally from the start of operations of our new southwest distribution center which we estimate to be 1.5 to 2 cent EPS drag, and rent deleveraging resulting from the increased mix of the new western stores. Although I will provide full guidance at our year-end conference call, I wanted to provide you with some considerations for your modeling of 2016.", "Fiscal year 2016 will be the year that we add a 53rd week to our retail fiscal year. Based on past trends, we estimate that this will provide and EPS benefit of approximately $0.02 to $0.03. This will be the first year of operations of the southwest distribution center. This will increase SG&A on a year-over-year basis while improving gross margin through reduced transportation expense. We expect a net EPS decrease of approximately $0.04. We will continue to transition the Del stores to Tractor Supply stores. We expect the majority of the Del stores to close in the fourth quarter and anticipate it will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.02.", "As we have stated in our long-term capital plan, we look to manage the annual capital expenditures in the $200 million to $250 million range in order to be ratable in our allocation of capital and leverage depreciation expense over the next several years. In 2016 we will not have a significant cash investment of a distribution center and we will look to continue investing in our stores and key initiatives to benefit long-term growth. Our goal continues to be to execute these initiatives while managing the financial impact to deliver our annual EPS target of mid-teens growth.", "To conclude, we are pleased with our results and execution in the third quarter, we believe that we took advantage of the extended spring-summer selling season and are well-positioned to deliver another solid growth year. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter Benedict", "A couple of questions. First, just on the third quarter, the September with the cold weather products. Tony, you said it weighed on comps, can you qualify maybe to what degree that shift kind of weighed on the second quarter, or on the third quarter? And was September comps positive or was it such that it actually dragged those negative?", "Tony Crudele", "Pete, as far as the comps go, we did have a positive comp in September and really we saw the drag just impact the last few weeks of the month. So as much as we don\u2019t really give monthly comp, I don\u2019t want to go into the specific details as to what the impact was but it did have an impact on the quarter relative to what our expectations were.", "Peter Benedict", "Okay. No, that's fair enough. And just looking at the new store productivity, I know that the way we calculate it isn't always perfect but it had been running mid to high 70s. It was in the low 70s in the quarter. I don't know if that had something to do with some of the closings or the timing of the openings. Was there anything interesting within the productivity of new stores that you saw during the third quarter?", "Tony Crudele", "No, there is nothing unusual and any differences really would relate to timing of the store openings.", "Peter Benedict", "Okay. My last question is just around the D&A profile. You're going to open up the DC. You've been running like $30 million of D&A per quarter here through the first three quarters of '15. How does that step up in the fourth quarter, how materially? And then as we think to next year, just a thought on D&A growth year-over-year. You may have mentioned that in your outlook, if you did I apologize.", "Tony Crudele", "No. We didn\u2019t specifically focus on D&A. But I would not expect that the run rate in the fourth quarter to step up significantly and it would be more impactful next year as the DC comes on line and we have a full year of depreciation relative to the DC.", "Operator", "Next question comes from David Magee with SunTrust.", "David Magee", "Good quarter. Was there much or have you seen much of an impact today on sales in the oil patch areas at this point?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes, David, this is Steve Barbarick. And first of all, I think on the last call we mentioned that the oil drilling areas represent about 10% of our total store count. And a large majority of those stores are down in Texas, so I will use the example here. We have got control stores down there and we have got the what we consider to be the oil and gas stores. The oil and gas stores are running positive comps and they have positive traffic. However, with that said, they are running less than company in chain average. Where we are seeing the impact is on some of the categories that are more bigger ticket. So truck boxes and in fuel tanks and some compressors.", "We are making that up, however, in a lot of the basic needs that our customers have down there in terms of consumable businesses. So generally speaking, we are seeing little bit of an impact but generally it's not been material enough to impact the overall company's comps.", "David Magee", "Would you say it's been sort of running stable at that level or has there been any change in the past couple of months?", "Steve Barbarick", "I mean it's been pretty stable. It's trended down a little bit. It's not significant. It's nothing that would be worth noting.", "David Magee", "Okay. Thank you. And then my second question has to do with just further opportunity with regard to higher ASP items to bring into the mix. As you look to next year do you see more additions, more upside in that area?", "Steve Barbarick", "Actually, this is an area that we see an opportunity with. And we have talked a lot on the merchant team about the fact that our customers are looking for value. But value can be on the higher end of the ticket as well. And we have seen some nice movement in recreational vehicles, we have brought in some higher end trailers. We are also looking at a number of commercial products as we move forward. For example, some heavier duty cattle handling cattle handling equipment up in the northwest. Looking at, I guess at higher end trailers, premium rubber footwear, price points that may range up to the $200 price point. We are also expanding some recreational vehicles and we have got a unit right now that we are testing that\u2019s up to $9000. So generally speaking, we are seeing an opportunity with our customers to actually take them upscale by offering new products is differentiated.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.", "Peter Keith", "I thank you, and great results. I want to dig in a little bit, Tony, on the gross margin dynamic. The up 60 basis points year-on-year is a little bit better than Q2 at the same time looks like you got less benefit from freight. So are you seeing some accelerating benefits around your product margin from the clearance optimization effort?", "Tony Crudele", "Yes, Peter, as we try to sort of break out the components, it is obviously difficult because many things overlap. But we firmly believe that probably the most significant driver outside of the fuel, the favorability of the fuel, really was in the price management and really sort of the vendor negotiation and working with the vendors and coming up with some great programs. So that along with the price management tools and getting better at optimizing the prices, I think really was the key component in that large increase in the gross margin percent.", "Peter Keith", "Is there anything within Q3 with regard to seasonality and maybe the summer to fall transition that gives you more opportunity in Q3 with regard to price management relative to other quarters or can it be pretty consistent through the year?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. Peter, this is Steve. I would tell you, it can be consistent. I mean there were times of the year where spring seasonal were transitional and fall winter were transitioning. There are always pivotal months. This past quarter we talked a little bit about clearance optimization and while it only makes up a small part of the total pricing management tools that we have, we were able to leverage that tool. We had about 60% of our clearance merchandize on that tool and early learnings suggested that we take markdowns earlier and we take them a little deeper while we have got them in the home before we have to liquidate them in the back of the store. So the team did an excellent job executing to that and we think that tool is going to give us momentum as we refine it and we get better with it.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.", "Simeon Gutman", "One more on macro. I hate to waste one of my questions on it but the age old question of farm income. I know we talk about it probably once every four or six quarters but you probably have better granularity on it by regions. So curious, any impact that you are seeing from it? As you get bigger maybe you have more impact with a wider reach of customers. Curious if there is any correlation to that or still irrelevant to your business.", "Greg Sandfort", "Yes. Simeon, I hate that you waste your question on that one as well. Yes, we do not see any correlation with the farm income and as we look at the performance across the country and in the particular areas where the farming is stronger, again, we can't draw a correlation.", "Simeon Gutman", "Fair enough. And then another question on I guess stem miles or gross margin. It's a little early I think to talk about next year, you gave us a couple of clues. You mentioned the headwind this year, stem miles. Does the headwind stay the same next year or does it moderate with the new DC opening?", "Greg Sandfort", "Yes, good question. When we look at it and model it out, our goal is to obviously support the operations at DC by reducing transportation cost. And as we move into next year and as I mentioned that we do anticipate having a drag next year, a net drag between the transportation improvements and the operations of DC. One of the keys is to reduce the stem miles and that is very dependent on our vendor base and making sure that they have key shipping points out west. And so we do anticipate and we modeled accordingly to show some reduction in the stem miles but we still have some more work to do as we continue to improve the shipping points from the vendor base.", "Simeon Gutman", "I guess just to clarify that point, I know we didn\u2019t put a number on what stem miles are holding back gross margin, but is that basis point amount, could that end up -- is it less of a drag by virtue of comparison or could it be the same number next year as this year?", "Greg Sandfort", "No, I think definitely the stem miles will decrease substantially, so we will have a positive impact relative to the gross margin. Just not to the extent that it will offset the full four wall operations of the distribution center.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.", "Seth Sigman", "Just digging into the ticket component of comps this quarter. When you look at big ticket, it slowed, it seems primarily related to weather and maybe the comparison. Anything else to read into that or should we expect that to pick back up as the weather turns?", "Steve Barbarick", "Seth, this is Steve. It was little bit of a mixed bag because we saw some improvements in things like recreational vehicles and trailers. But the drag was in categories such as, and Tony had mentioned, stoves and log splitters and generators. Those typically tend to be a little bit more weather driven and being a needs based retailer you kind of see that. So I would tend to skew toward that and not a shift in customer spending behavior.", "Seth Sigman", "Okay. And then a separate question on the loyalty program that you guys are testing. I realize it's early but maybe to that last point, given the need based aspect of the business, can you discuss where you see some of the incremental opportunities from that program and maybe the cost associated with rolling that out?", "Steve Barbarick", "Well, it is early, let me just say that first. And to give you a sense for how early it is, we just starting piling it, I guess, 21 days ago. It's in about 10% of our stores and it's in different regions so we can track it. Right now this is, I think Greg said, we are pleased with the initial response from our customers. What the data is giving us is the ability to track their purchases going forward as well as an email address so we can be more efficient in the way we communicate with them and personalize that communication. We are still working through the next steps in how we are going to manage this. I can tell you that today working with our marketing department, not everything we do is highly efficient. And we are going to be able to tailor some of those dollars and move them into our loyalty program. And at the end of the day, I think what we are going to do is we should see an improvement of loyalty with these customers which should follow sales and it should offset the cost that we would put into the program.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Hiram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.", "Hiram Rubinson", "I have two things. One is, you have done a great job over time of broadening out the assortment even as you said getting into RVs up to $9000. Could you just talk a little bit about how your assortment looks versus a typical general store in the markets that you operate? What might be missing from your mix that others might have? Trying to figure out what new categories maybe could be relevant.", "Steve Barbarick", "You know Hiram I would tell you that we have got a differentiated assortment and it's what has made our organization very successful. We always talk about that in retail plagiarism is free and highly efficient, so we are shopping our farm store competitors, we are shopping big boxes and automotive centers. And we look it for those categories that we think are relevant to our customers lifestyles. Those folks that live out here as we call it. So again, there is a variety of things that we are testing and trying and I don\u2019t think there is any one or two specific things that I could mention on the call right now that we are probably not attempting somehow in our stores now or in the future.", "Hiram Rubinson", "But if you look -- let's say we take a look back at your assortment three years from now or five years from now, do you think we are seeing the tip of the iceberg in your store or are we still seeing the vast majority of the iceberg?", "Steve Barbarick", "Hiram, I have been with the organization for 18 years and I am as bullish today as I was 17 or 18 years ago when I got here working in merchandizing.", "Hiram Rubinson", "Well said. Let me just follow up on the second question around how you want to use your Internet business. Can you tell us whether or not you are looking to use it primarily for informational purposes for new products or for existing products? And if it is for existing products, do you have categories that are in the store today that you think that you can almost migrate online?", "Greg Sandfort", "Hiram, it's Greg. The strategy behind our omnichannel business is very simple. It's called the three Cs and it first starts with content. And content means giving the customer the information they need to make a decision to either buy online, buy in our store, research products that they think they have either an interest in or a need to have to satisfy something that they are either doing, building a project or something that they need to replace on their property. The second piece of it is community. And what we are finding is, through our experience right now out there in some of the social sites and our activity there, our consumers like to converse with us and with one another. So all that\u2019s doing is bringing them closer to us as a consumer base making us more of the desired, I think, retailer for them to exchange hopefully commerce with. And that is then the third C, commerce.", "And we are not -- we didn\u2019t set our site up nor did we ever think that it was going to be a large percentage of our sales. Our stores are located out where the customer lives. We are more convenient, if they break something let's say on a particular piece of tillage equipment or they blow a gasket on a small engine, they are not going to dial into the Web site and expect to get that delivery and wait for two or three days. They are going to expect to go to the store, find the part, replacement part, repair what they are doing and get back to the task. So the commerce side for us as we build out this entire omnichannel piece is to have immediate product available to them because we live close to them. So the strategy is, the first two Cs to be the first C. And we are never going to say that it's going to be a large percentage of our business but we are convinced and through the Neighbors program we are going to be able to track much closer those customers who are engaging with us through the web and then tying that back to a four wall store sales number.", "Hiram Rubinson", "Well, that world is evolving and it sounds like you have been pretty consistent in your approach so I appreciate the update.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS.", "Michael Lasser", "Tony, you outlined a number of put and takes that are going to impact the business next year. It wasn\u2019t clear in totality, should we expect mid-teens earnings growth next year?", "Tony Crudele", "Yes. Absolutely our target is to always grow the company EPS in the mid-teens. So that is our goal and we will manage accordingly.", "Michael Lasser", "And is that going to be inclusive of the extra week or will the extra week be on top of that?", "Tony Crudele", "You know since there is generally a range, and I know most people are going to probably be doing 15% and 17%, but I like to say mid-teens. So this is somewhere between 13% and 17%. So generally with or without that additional week since it is only a few cents, we anticipate that we will fall within that range. [indiscernible] growth.", "Michael Lasser", "Okay. My second question is, how are you thinking about the inflation, deflation environment as we move into the next year.", "Tony Crudele", "Good question. When we look to next year, I anticipate right now at this point in time, slight deflation in the, say, first half of the year and then as we move to the back half we expect it to be flat or actually some small level of inflation.", "Michael Lasser", "Are their things that could drive either upside or downside to that and maybe you think that would change the algorithm where deflation [leads] [ph] a little bit better on the margin side so gross profit dollar comp remains sustained?", "Tony Crudele", "No. As we look at it, in the past it's always been the impact on feed and on petroleum products. And those are really the two large drivers. The steel element has been less impactful. And we believe that we have cycled through the majority of some of the declines in feed. So I think that would be the biggest driver so we expect it to definitely moderate next year and stabilize some. And as we have shown in the past, be it moderate inflation or moderate deflation we have been able to manage the business so that we can get to the right bottom line.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.", "Brian Nagel", "So a couple of quick questions here. My first one I think is a follow up to a prior question but just to dial deeper into Texas. I know you have talked about this in prior quarters too but the numbers you read out here, they just make it sound that the Texas market is performing okay. Maybe a little worse than the company average [indiscernible], but if you look at the stores there, is there any more troubling signs below those big aggregate numbers meaning that are you seeing a wider dispersion of performance in the stores or are sales trends generally more erratic than the chain?", "Steve Barbarick", "No, Brian. As a matter of fact the only thing I would say is that the Texas market in total was right about company average. The oil drilling stores were the ones that were below company average. So Texas as a whole is still healthy.", "Brian Nagel", "Okay. And then, I mean not to belay this but the oil drilling store you mentioned, is there something you have seen there, are you seeing more erratic trends and you would expect to make a loss in kind of the aggregate common?", "Steve Barbarick", "No. I mean, it's not that volatile. I will tell you that when we saw a nice ramp up in compressors and some welders and big ticket merchandize, some of that has come down. But if you look at the total nucleus of the store, okay, in those area those stores are still comping positive and foot traffic is still positive even with the compression on some of the big ticket that we saw there. So I don\u2019t see anything that leads me to believe that Texas, the market itself or the state should be a concern for us.", "Brian Nagel", "That\u2019s helpful. Then the second question, more of a maintenance question, but with regard to the Del stores, how many stores there are left to be closed and when should we expect to see those closed?", "Steve Barbarick", "Generally, what we are trying to do, Brian, is time the closings relative to the lease expirations and do it as close as possible. But at the same time, we want to be able to open new stores and make sure that we transition staff appropriately. So as we see it, we believe the majority of the stores will close in the fourth quarter next year and we anticipate that being somewhere in the 16 to 17 store range in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan.", "Christopher Horvers", "Couple of follow up questions. So on the supply chain investment you spent about $16 million in CapEx in supply chain year-to-date. Curious, all-in, how much the DC will cost you on the CapEx side and or the mixing center is a big capital investment as well?", "Tony Crudele", "Sure. The number that you are seeing includes obviously investment through all of the distribution centers. As we complete the southwest distribution center, we anticipate that that\u2019s going to be in the $70 million range. And then the mixing centers, they will vary depending whether it's lease or acquisition but we anticipate putting somewhere in the $6 million range for each one of the mixing centers. So it's not a significant large capital investment.", "Christopher Horvers", "So as you think about the 200 to 250, the long-term capital guide, what could be some other, I guess chunky items that could fill in for that $70 million range. In other words, why wouldn\u2019t CapEx be a little bit lower next year than this year given you have will have that DC?", "Tony Crudele", "Well, a part of the issue is that we started the distribution project last year so some of the CapEx is split between the two years. So when you are looking at a delta -- but what we look at as far as continued investments in the business is, one, we always want to continue to invest in our store infrastructure and make sure that there are kept as current and up-to-date as possible. But we have other programs. One program in particular next year that we think has a significant return on investment is our LED lighting change out. And not only does it meet our stewardship program but we are really excited about the cost savings as well. So that will be a capital investment but we believe that payback will help throughout next year as well as in future years.", "So those are the type of initiatives that we are going to be continuing to drive so that we can continue to capture savings and be able to utilize those savings to continue to grow the company in a very efficient and productive way.", "Christopher Horvers", "And then on the west coast DC. How many stores are serviced out of that DC roughly at the end of this year and is there a -- what's the sort of store level that you start to get better leverage on, like you mentioned, the four wall ramped and operating cost of the distribution center.", "Tony Crudele", "Sur. You know we anticipate by the end of the year we are going to be around 100 stores that will be services by that distribution center. And generally we map this center out to be able to handle about 250 to 300 stores. So it will have some significant additional capacity. As we move forward, again as I mentioned earlier, a lot of it has to do with vendor shipping points and we will continue to coordinate with our vendors and as our vendor base grows, hopefully they will grow with us as well and have shipping points out west. As well as it will help it will help our capacity when we have imports coming in from the west and that will reduce some of the stem miles. So one of the keys is that as we progress more towards about the 150 store range, we will start to see some benefits and hopefully we will have more of a net impact, net neutral impact when it comes to the P&L.", "Christopher Horvers", "So it seems like based on the timing of the weighting of the West Coast opens, that starts to be something really later, later in 2016 where you could see some leverage or at least flattening out.", "Tony Crudele", "Yes. Now clearly as we move through the year, we will start to gather more of the benefits through the distribution center. And so, yes, as you model, when you look at the drag that we identified in the, I guess about the $0.04 range, I would say in the first year it's going to be slightly weighted more to the first half but it's not going to be something that's so front weighted that there won't be any impact in Q4.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We next move to Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs.", "Stephen Tanal", "You called out a bunch of different pressures in the SG&A line and considering all that, I actually thought that it looked very well controlled. I was wondering what might have went in your favor this quarter. Can you comment on that?", "Tony Crudele", "Sure. When we look at the -- the biggest number what I had identified which was related to the store support center that happened last year. And I think as we accumulated the adjustments relative to lease write-offs and accelerated depreciation, it totaled in about to $3 million range. So that clearly was the largest one. As we look to the back half of the year coming into it, we had some expense savings initiatives out there and we felt that we did a great job in particular in the third quarter itself. But some of those are really just one time savings that relate just to the third quarter. Again, we are focused on the fourth quarter but as we have forecasted out, we believe that we won't have that benefit of the store support center expenses last year in Q3. So we expect to inch back up into the 10% range versus the 9% that we are at in Q3.", "Stephen Tanal", "Got it. And can you just remind us what some of those savings initiatives were?", "Tony Crudele", "Relative to -- they really just relate more to some of the discretionary expenses that we have in the quarter. And even it could be just basic ones relative to how we had managed the store payroll, as we mentioned, in Q2. We went in a little bit heavier with some of our payroll initiatives but as we came into Q3, the team did a tremendous job in managing that. Now as we move into Q4, it's a big selling period for us and we expect to continue to driver our sales with proper adequate staffing to do that.", "Stephen Tanal", "Got it. Okay. And just lastly, can you just remind us what kind of a comp you need to leverage rent and occupancy within SG&A?", "Tony Crudele", "It will vary quarter-over-quarter and one of the biggest impacts is the incentive compensation. So I will always qualify with that. But when it comes to leveraging, we have really been more in the 3.5% to 4% range when it comes to leveraging SG&A. And again my other standard qualification is that a lot of the things that we do as far as improving the business and the initiatives that we have, that expanse runs through our SG&A where some of it will benefit our gross margin initiative. So things like demand planning, obviously the mixing centers expenses in SG&A, the distribution centers in SG&A, but we will get the benefit on the gross margin line. So that\u2019s why I believe that it makes it a little bit more difficult to be able to leverage SG&A and that\u2019s why you see the number running into 3.5% to 4% comp range.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.", "Seth Basham", "My first question is on new store productivity, just want to follow up there. You noted, Tony, that there is nothing with timing this quarter. Is the decline that we saw in new store productivity year-over-year related to the productivity out of some of the western stores?", "Tony Crudele", "Well, when I look at it I really think it would just the timing of the store openings. Our stores that are opening this year are exceeding our pro forma very consistent with past performance. So it's really a non-issue. Some of it from a sales productivity standpoint really can be the mix of the stores that we are opening and that would be the only other impact other than the timing.", "Seth Basham", "Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, just in terms of the merchandising trends. You talked about pet food and animal feed being a pretty strong category. Can you comment on how you fared with the Purina feed line expansion?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes, absolutely. Seth, this is Steve. That launch was really part and parcel of something much bigger and that\u2019s our key strategy. And we added the product in our stores, it was really around more premium for horse, cattle and show feeds. It allowed us to hit higher price points. There was a question earlier about higher price points and how our customers are reacting. You know it's still a relatively small portion of our total business, the expanded line that we put in, but I can tell you it's been incremental and we have seen nice growth in our feed business. And I believe the addition of these SKUs has lend credibility to the entire line. So we are pleased with it.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Denise Chai with Bank of America.", "Denise Chai", "Just going back to the weather issue towards the end of the quarter. Could you talk about the delta between, say the Northeast and upper Midwest and the other regions?", "Tony Crudele", "Relative to the weather itself or the performance?", "Denise Chai", "Comps in those regions once you started to anniversary the strong demand for fall and winter products that happened last year.", "Tony Crudele", "Sure. Clearly, up north during that period of time where you are expecting a little bit cooler weather, the comps in the upper Midwest and the northeast ran slightly down. And when I say slightly I mean very low single digits during that time period. But other than that the rest of the chain performed very well. So it clearly wasn\u2019t a weather issue when it came to the softness of sales.", "Denise Chai", "Okay. Got it. Thanks. And are you able to break out how much big ticket was a drag on overall ticket?", "Tony Crudele", "Well, we had quantified that at being about 90 basis points that it impacted average tickets. When it came to the transactions, for us big ticket is relatively small transaction impact and the impact generally is going to be on the average ticket itself. So I would just use the 90 basis points that we talked about on average ticket.", "Denise Chai", "Okay. Got it. And just last one. Since you've relaunched your Web site, could you give us an update in terms of what sort of growth you're seeing online, average order size? How much gets picked up in store and what categories you're really seeing the most traction?", "Greg Sandfort", "Denise, this is Greg. I won't give you which categories are doing best or worst, I think it follows suit to what you heard for the rest of the company sales. We suffered a little bit in heating and other places like that. What we are finding is because this side is more easier to navigate with, the customers are starting to add multiple things to baskets. Our actual traffic is up, our conversion is about flat to where it was but that\u2019s anytime you go through a change like that in the Web site or some things you have to do within Google's search engine to gain that some of that back. But we are very optimistic that the changes we have made as we go through the holiday season are going to benefit us in a big way.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Incorporated.", "Ben Bienvenu", "So you talked a little bit about the mixing centers in Texas. You've also talked about 20 to 30 centers that you think you could build longer term. Do you have any sense of the velocity of that build out or is it just too early at this point?", "Greg Sandfort", "Yes, I would tell you that, Ben, that it's a model we need to make sure that it's going to prove itself out. We, as you know, had about a two year, 18 month to two year test of this in the back of one of our other distribution centers where we had space. We have now rolled two physical facilities into play. So far I would say we are pleased but some of the challenges, they are going to be different in different markets. So right now we placed these two in Texas and these are high velocity feed food markets. As we will use these in other parts of the country and the key behind this is to bring inventory more direct to the store, faster replenishment, pull that inventory out of the back of the store so they don\u2019t have to hold two and three weeks worth of supply. That makes it so much easier for a store to operate. But so far so good but it's going to be little different by region and all I can tell you is we may not 30 or 25, we may find it 15 to 18 is enough. But it really is -- supply chain build out is something we are still working through and we will give you more information on that as time progresses.", "Ben Bienvenu", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. And then maybe switching gears back to the southwest distribution center. As that center comes online, obviously you've talked about the reduction in stem miles, but to what extent do you expect it to positively benefit store productivity from a sales perspective? And can you point to instances in the past where you've built new DCs and how that may have impacted sales at surrounding stores that were serviced?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, the last several DCs we have built, one was a replacement DC from a Georgia DC to another, the other was one located in the Midwest here early, I will call it beginning of the south which is up in Franklin, Kentucky. And that was just based upon volume of stores that were opening in the region. So here would be some of the benefits in this Arizona facility. Stores in the West Coast no longer have to have merchandize moving from Waverley, Nebraska and Waco, Texas. The transit time is long. So we should be able to turn that transit time and make it much shorter to replenish those stores if we see a run on the certain category of business.", "Secondly, we will hold a little different mix of product in that distribution center than you would have say in the eastern part of the United States because the climate and temperatures are different out there. So some of the unique mix of products that we would not typically store in the other DCs we will put into this distribution center in hopes of having more of the manufacturers that build that specific product sitting in the West Coast for either manufacturing or their own distribution facility so we can move it to our DC and then back to our stores, not moving it from the east all the way across to our DC and then from there to the stores.", "So it's really about replenishment capability and turnaround time.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We next move to Jaime Katz with Morningstar.", "Jaime Katz", "I just wanted to follow on that mixing center question. I'm curious how that plays into how you guys think about inventory turns longer and then how that flows through to possible improvement in the gross margin. Do you guys have maybe a goal of where you'd like those trends to go, because you've made some pretty impressive strides over the last handful of years there?", "Greg Sandfort", "Jamie, good question. Here is a couple of things to think about. One is, mixing centers are closer distance to the store base than the large DC. So the whole philosophy behind that was to be able to turn merchandise faster back to the stores, replenish and keep the weeks of inventory out of the backrooms because our stores don\u2019t have large backrooms. We like to bring inventory in so much just in time and push it to the floor. So the modeling we have done on all this would tell you that number one, it makes the store to easy to operate and number two, we should see some gain in turn. But the facts are that we have only got two up and running. It's not significant enough to probably impact the overall company turn at this point but longer term it should.", "Jaime Katz", "Okay. And then do you guys have any comments on the HomeTown Pet, read through on how those consumers are maybe converting to regular Tractor Supply consumers or adopting some of the brands a little bit more broadly? I don't know if there's any anecdotal evidence that that's happening yet.", "Lee Downing", "Well, this is Lee. We are just about a cycle a year, so we continue to still learn because we are just now going to see some comparisons come up so we are excited about that. As far as brand conversion, what we are seeing is the customers are somewhat different, they are a little bit smaller dogs and smaller animals than they are in Tractor Supply that maybe outside dogs. So I think we see a little bit difference there. We are seeing the customers are eager to adopt our exclusive brands, so I think that\u2019s a great learning that we can deliver good value on both sets of the equation there. And I think overall, it's been a -- we feel very confident that we are getting some learnings for Tractor Supply as we move forward. So I think we are very positive about it.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer", "Greg, at the investor meeting back in February, you had discussed the opportunity to open stores in markets that are a bit larger than you have historically. You gave some examples in the Houston area, stores that were a bit closer to, say, a Home Depot and Lowe's. Can you discuss how the stores with that change in the real estate strategy are performing?", "Greg Sandfort", "Dan, not really a change in real estate strategy, more of a learning from our real estate portfolio. And what we have seen that it continues to work for us. Today our base store is a little different than it was maybe ten years ago when we are purely, for the most part, a rural lifestyle store sitting a good 15-20 miles outside of most city limits. Today with some of the urban crawl and some of the other locations that our real estate model has told us can work for us, we do sit a little closer to some of the Home Depot's and Lowe's. We are not as far out as we once were. About 67% to 68%, I think the number of our stores, sit within a proximity of a Home Depot and a Lowe's. So we complement one another in those markets, to be very honest. I think you may have had one of the store walks with the team and you notice that we both have hardware but it's very different assortments.", "We both have tools, but we are heavily into welding and in to power equipment that\u2019s used in air tools whereas they are into more hand tools and electric type products. So the store base will continue to evolve, Dan, as the model tells us where we can place those stores. But it hasn\u2019t changed really that much it's just evolving. ", "Dan Wewer", "Okay. And then just one quick follow up. We estimate that the inventory per square foot finished the quarter up about 1.2%. Had the company not seen the softness in some of the winter product during the last couple of weeks in September, were you expecting your inventory per store to be essentially flat year-over-year?", "Greg Sandfort", "Probably a little down, to be very honest because we came out of the spring season. Steve and his team did a great job managing through the inventories and we are actually chasing some product towards the latter part of second, early third quarter. But what caused a little bit of movement upward was really all the forward movement of some heating products and things into the assortment and into the stores a little earlier. Yes. That was the impact of it.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "What I'd like to ask about is a little bit more related to precipitation, which often is affected by the temperature. But where it's been particularly dry, what are you seeing in terms of water handling equipment, things related to pumps and tankage, and how was that performing?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes, Chuck, I mean we have talked a lot about being a needs based retailer and when it comes either wet weather or dry weather, we see our business thrive in many of those cases we are a destination for those types of products. So if it's dry, people need to transfer water. We sell water pumps. We have got a full line of different products to support their needs. So we won't get into the specifics of it but I can tell you as a needs based retailer and the differentiated assortments that we have, we typically do pretty well and I would use the example of the West Coast for example. We have seen dry weather out there for quite a while but yet we continue to open stores and see, as Tony said, above average comps in a lot of those stores. So, again, it works for our model.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard", "Two things. First of all, the sales that were impacted by weather at the end of the quarter, do those get recaptured at full margin is the expectation in 4Q, and is this material in the whole scheme of things?", "Steve Barbarick", "Eric, this is Steve. What I can tell you is, as when it got cold a few weeks and few days, we saw our cold weather business move. What I can't tell you is how cold it's going to be in Q4 and what part of the country it's going to be really cold in. What I can say, and Tony said it earlier I think on his initial call, is that last year in November it was colder, December was a little warmer. We think that\u2019s going to flip. But I can't say whether or not all sales are going to be deferred. Q4, we do much more cold weather products than we do in Q3. Q3 was a small portion of the total.", "Eric Bosshard", "Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly on gross margin, the upside in the quarter, the payback from some of the price and markdown optimization. Not asking if there's more quarters above 60 basis points of gross margin but are there more quarters of notable benefit from those efforts? How should we think about that?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. What I would tell you is that we have invested in a variety of systems and we do expect get some benefit from those systems but there is a number of variables that play in the margin as well. We will continue to become more efficient as we use science rather than art and that\u2019s how we are operating today. So I think we have got a good track record and a good run but I don\u2019t know what percent you are going to see those improvements over time. We are going to continue to operate as we have in the past. Tony, I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add.", "Tony Crudele", "No, I would agree that the most important thing is a lot of it is year-over-year performance and markdowns and clearance through a particular cycle or season. That\u2019s going to override the benefit of any of the price management tools that we put into place. But the key is, as we continue to develop these tools and utilize and become more adapt, we clearly lay a basis of improvements so that we can continue to even in a tough quarter be able to drive more efficient and better sales and obviously drive the comps. So it's really a critical element of our continuous improvement program.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam Sindler", "First, I guess I'd like to say I'm glad I was wrong on the quarter. Very solid, as always.", "Greg Sandfort", "Everybody gets the tractor Adam. ", "Adam Sindler", "Yes, I know. That's what you guys told me last time. I have learned my lesson. So I want to focus my question on the continued strong traffic trends. As you look at the results, I'm hoping maybe you could provide a little bit more color on the drivers here. I know you guys have been doing a lot with customer acquisition initiatives, maybe more share of wallet from existing customers, and then as you look at the new western stores, maybe how much is coming from there?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. Adam, what I would tell you is is that a lot of it has to do with our strategy around queue. We continue to gain momentum in a lot of those businesses and a needs-based retailer, when you sell a lot of consumables and you build loyalty, and we have got great team members in our stores, you get a lot of repeat customers coming back through. You know there is also the word of mouth marketing that we get the benefit of because we are in local communities. And a lot of the folks that shop us tell their neighbors. And so I think it's 30 straight quarters of comp transaction growth and I think a lot of that stems from a lot of what we are doing inside the store but I would also tell you has a lot to do with the assortments that we put strategies around.", "Adam Sindler", "And as you think about maybe who you're taking share from, I know in the past you've discussed a number, or a number of how many of these smaller, really mom and pop operations you have. But then just sort of relative to Dan's question earlier, you find that you are maybe a little bit easier to evolve your real estate strategy into larger cities, maybe some more from some of the big box guys. As you look at that really small mom and pop though, is that number still coming down quite a bit and how much do you think share do they really have of the market?", "Steve Barbarick", "We don\u2019t typically get into the share number game here. What we can say is we are a consolidator for the lifestyle and our goal as an organization is to bring the needs of our customer under one roof and allow them to come in and our hope is that they will shop, peg hooks, shelves, four ways, center courts and end caps. And I think we have done a nice job with our assortments, tailoring them to that lifestyle and they continue to reward us with traffic.", "Greg Sandfort", "I would also say, Adam, the emphasis Steve and the merchant team and the marketing team and the stores team have put in to this localization of products and really being understanding the market needs has played off and paid big dividends for us. Our stores may look the same as you walk through them but as you go down those aisles, as Steve was saying those end caps and that, you are going to notice very specific products geared toward those individual markets. And in this business and those who we compete with in this business, they are good at that. And that\u2019s something that we have gotten far better at for the last several years.", "Operator", "And with no further questions in queue, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Greg Sandfort for closing remarks.", "Greg Sandfort", "Okay. Well, thanks everybody for joining us today and we are looking ahead and we are pleased with our performance as I said for the first nine months of the year and we really do feel very positive about our position heading into fourth quarter. Along with our continuous improvement efforts as Steve had mentioned, we have got things happening in merch and in marketing and we will continue to invest in our systems and infrastructure to support the long-term growth of Tractor Supply, driving return on capital and achieving our goal of mid-teens annual earnings growth. Thank you for your continued support of Tractor Supply and we look forward to speaking with you again in January regarding our fourth quarter and full year of 2015 results.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference.

Greg, please go ahead.", "Greg Sandfort", "Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us. On call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Barbarick, our EVP and Chief Merchandising, Marketing and Supply Chain officer.", "We are pleased with our result and execution of our business in the first quarter. Comparable store sales increased 4.9% and were driven by increases in both traffic and ticket. This was our 32nd consecutive quarter of positive comparable transaction count. Our sales were balanced across product categories and regions with all of our major product categories and geographic regions generating positive comparable store sales. Once again the Tractor Supply team did an excellent job managing the business this quarter and we believe our results demonstrate the resiliency of our business model. ", "Our customers rely on us to be the most dependable supplier of everyday basic products for their rural lifestyle needs. They shop our stores regularly and they buy what they need, when they needed for their pets, animals, land and equipment. Some of their needs are year around. Some are seasonal and some are weather related. We know these seasons and weather can influence a timing of when our customers shop certain products and we also know it is our job to manage our inventory accordingly. One change that we implemented in the first quarter of this year was a flow of our seasonal inventory into our stores. Last year we had three regional set dates for spring merchandize which ranged from mid January through early February. Acting on feedback from our store managers and analyzing sales and inventory data, we changed our approach for 2016 and moved to five set dates this year. Starting with the south in late December and ending with the north in late February early March.", "This allowed us to capture early spring sales in the south and additional late winter sales in the north. Combining these with our clearance pricing tool from Revionics we were able to drive sales, preserve margin and reduce inventory levels as we transition our business during the first quarter. This quarter we did have a little help from mother nature. And we had the right products and stock to meet our customers' need in both seasonal and everyday CUE products. When the snow and cold finally arrived in many of our markets in January, we had the inventory to meet those customers need and we sold through a good portion of our winter seasonal merchandize. Similarly, when spring like conditions develop in the number of our southern market in March, we were again ready and our continued investments in everyday CUE products kept us positioned to drive this segment of our business throughout the quarter as well. ", "As a result, we experienced solid sales across both everyday and seasonal products for the quarter. This year's Chicks Day event which was another success generating strong traffic driving sales and growing awareness regarding backyard poultry across a wide range of customers. The event features live chicks and ducklings along with all the necessary products for their care and maintenance. This is one of our most popular events of the year and positions Tractor Supply as an authority in the areas of animal care and sustainable living. It speaks to the self reliance and sustainability trend that we continue to see in our marketplace and is a great example of how we are appealing to a wider consumer base. ", "As we discussed briefly at our Investment Community Day in February, we've identified broad consumer trends around four areas of our business. Those being pets, services, by land and sustainable living. We believe these are go forward areas of opportunity for Tractor Supply and we are developing and testing strategies for products and events that will address these trends. Another area of growing importance is the application of technology into our business including systems involving inventory management, allocation, customer information capture and mobile. ", "We continue to improve our processes to better manage inventory, enhance our assortments and grow the business longer term. One example is our new plan-o-gram facility which we call our Merchandize Innovation Center or MIC. This facility enables our teams and vendors to work in a simulated store environment as we plan changes to our assortment mix and store visuals and overall flow changes within the four-wall store. In addition to the MIC, enhancement across our planning and allocation systems are important tools that we are utilizing to improve our business to meet the ever evolving needs of our customers. ", "As we look ahead to the remainder of 2016, we will continue to enhance our omni channel platform, customer relationship marketing and our IT security across the entire organization. We are also in the process of implementing the EMV chip and signature platform in our stores with completion expected by mid of this year. ", "On the merchandizing side, our focus will continue to be on new and differentiated products across the store as well as opportunities to expand our offerings an exclusive brand always being mindful of the positioning for the key national brand that our customers expect to find within our assortment. On the store operation side of our business, we are improving our in-store special ordering process and making it easier for our team members to assist customers and locating hard to find products to expand product offerings, utilizing our drop ship vendors. And we are embarking on the largest store sustainability project to date with the retrofitting of the entire store base with new LED lighting in 2016 and 2017. Thus far we've converted one third of our stores plan for 2016 with LED lighting and those stores are benefiting from improved lighting quality as well as lower energy and maintenance cost. ", "So in closing, let me extend my sincere thanks to all the hardworking dedicated team members of Tractor Supply and it's really our people who serve our customers everyday and execute our business strategy that drive our continued success as a company. ", "With that said I'd like to turn the call over to Tony now for a more detail commentary on our first quarter results and our outlook for 2016. Tony? ", "Tony Crudele", "Thanks, Greg. And good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 26, 2016, on a year-over-year basis net sales increased 10.2% to $1.47 billion. Net income increased 16.6% to $66.7 million, and EPS increased 19% to $0.50 per diluted share.", "Comp store sales increased 4.9% in the first quarter, compared to an increase of 5.7% in the last year's first quarter. Comp transaction count increased for the 32nd consecutive quarter, gaining 4.2% on top of a 4.8% increase last year. As Greg mentioned sale trends were broad based both from a product and a geographic perspective. Everyday items continue to perform well and were key driver the comp transaction increase. Average comp ticket increased by 73 basis points on top of last year's 84 basis points increase. The increase was driven principally by an increase in number of SKUs per transaction partially offset by deflation. ", "Sales of spring seasonal merchandize were also strong in the quarter as we experienced the March that was warmer than average and also warmer than last year. Spring seasonal category such as lawn and garden, riding lawn mowers, fencing, animal health and fly control performed very well. Winter seasonal sales were strong in January as the cold weather rolled in but sales softened in February which was much warmer than last year. Cold weather in January gave us the opportunity to clear most of our winter clothing specifically insulated auto wear. However, the cold weather was too brief to drive significant sales in certain hard line categories such as heating and log splitters. ", "Other comments regarding sales in the quarter, comp sales were positive across all regions and major product categories with the strongest sales coming in the Southeast which was impacted less by the mild winter season. Big ticket comp sales increased slightly but below chain average and were driven by early spring season riding lawn mower and trailer sales, partially offset by soft sales in winter power equipment and log splitters. ", "Transactions drove the increase in the big ticket comps. But overall the increase in big ticket did not materially impact overall company comps. We estimate that deflation impacted sales by approximately 25 basis points driven principally by livestock feed, lubricant and propane categories. As I mentioned, mild March temperatures benefited the sales of early spring merchandize, also Easter was one week earlier than last year. Thereby shifting the strong Friday and Saturday sales days into our first quarter. We estimate that these two factors positively impacted first quarter results by pulling forward approximately $18 million in sales and $0.02 per diluted share. ", "The oil patch stores continue to comp positive but below chain average consistent with the trend in Q4. Transaction count remains firm in these stores. We are expecting that the impact will moderate through the years as we begin to cycle the trend from last year. ", "Now turning to gross margin which increased 30 basis points to 33.7% versus a decrease of 8 basis points last year. The merchandize team did a great job driving gross margin while managing through our winter seasonal clearance. We benefited from our key margin initiatives and price management, import and exclusive brands. The benefit of these initiatives more than offset the impact from heavier clearance sales of winter seasonal merchandize. The merchandize team continues to work diligently with our vendor community on both the product development and cost side of the business which is improving margin.", "We also benefited from vendor support program associated with the initial stocking of our new Arizona DC while we loaded the DC with inventory late last year we began shipping the stores in late December and recognizing the benefit as we sold through the merchandize in Q1. We estimate these positively impacted gross margin approximately 15 basis points. We estimate that deflation had a minimal impact on gross margin as deflation continues to decline in the feed category. ", "Freight was slightly unfavorable, lower diesel prices and the decrease outbound 10 miles to our western stores more than offset by an increase inbound miles to our Arizona DC and a higher mix of freight intensive categories. The mix of merchandize had a slight negative impact on gross margin; higher sales of riding lawn mowers were offset by lower sales of heating products both of which carry below chain average margins. ", "For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was 26.3% of sales, an improvement of 11 basis points over the prior year's quarter. Overall SG&A benefited from a strong comp sales increase. However, we are very pleased with the expense control and leverage that we achieved given that we had an estimated headwind of $3.5 million or approximately 24 basis points from the start up of our Arizona DC and the two mixing centers that were not in operation last year at this time. We are very pleased with our payroll management in Q1, as the team reacted well and allocated payroll appropriately with the sales trends resulting in leverage in the quarter. Medical and related payroll expenses levered as well. ", "We also leverage occupancy as we benefited from low utility and store winter maintenance expense as a result of the mild winter weather. This benefit was partially offset by the rental leverage that we experienced as we open new stores. ", "Incentive compensation did not have a material impact on SG&A in this quarter. The tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% compared to 36.9% last year due to additional state tax credit of both periods include one time state tax credit that we did not anticipate receiving at the same level in subsequent years. ", "Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had a cash balance of $74.5 million and $230 million in outstanding debt, compared to a cash balance of $57 million and $60 million in outstanding debt last year. During the first quarter under our stock repurchase program, we acquired close to 1.2 million shares for $99.1 million. Inventory per store increased 1% and annualized inventory return decreased to 2.94. We had anticipated that turns would decrease in Q1 as we began the quarter heavy with winter season merchandize as well as stocking our new Arizona DC. We are pleased how the team managed the mark- down cadence and inventory purchases bringing the quarter imbalances down essentially to last year's levels. ", "We believe we are well positioned as we head into the second quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $36.7 million compared to $48.8 million last year. We opened 36 stores and close three Del's stores in the first quarter compared to 41 new stores opened and one Del's store closed in the first quarter of 2015. ", "So with respect to our financial expectations for the full year 2016 as noted in today's press release, we have reiterated our previous guidance. While our Q1 performance was strong, there is still a lot of business ahead of us in the spring and summer season. As we've said in the past, it is best to evaluate our performance by the half as we see the spring season play out in full. Therefore, we believe it is prudent to revisit our guidance at the end of the second quarter. As a reminder, we expect full year sales to range from $6.9 billion to $7 billion. We have forecasted comp sales to range between 3.5% and 5%. We are targeting 20 to 25 basis points improvement in EBIT margin compared to 2015. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $455 million to $467 million or $3.40 to $3.48 per diluted share. We expect to open between 115-120 new stores with approximately 30% scheduled to be opened in the first half of the year. Additionally, we forecast our effective tax rate will be approximately 36.9%. ", "While we expect capital expenditures in 2016 to range between $230 million to $250 million. And we are making good progress on our LED lighting retrofit and expect to be completing this year's target of half of the chain by mid third quarter. We'll continue to make purchases under share repurchase program as part of our long-term balanced approach to shareholder return, we expect to be in a borrow position at the end of each quarter and target yearend debt position to be approximately $200 million. We continue to expect deflation to be less than the headwind ranging between 20 basis points early in the year and flat in the second half of the year. ", "So that concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "And we will take our first question from Seth Sigman with ", "Credit Suisse.", "Seth Sigman", "Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a great quarter guys. You discussed the change in the flow of seasonal inventory into the stores. It seems that was pretty powerful change to help manage some of the weather volatility in the quarter. Is there a way to quantify the benefit in Q1? And do you see other opportunities in other quarters for changing the flow? ", "Steve Barbarick ", "Seth, this is Steve Barbarick. I'd tell you it's really hard to quantify that specifically. As Greg mentioned in year's past we had three waves over two weeks, this year we went to five waves over eight weeks. Our planning department and our inventory teams have really matured to a level where we are able to do this. And we got the technology now to do it. I would tell you what we experienced in Q1 was quite favorable for us. And that something we will do going forward. And in the back half of the year I think we got a pretty good plan. We made some adjustments in the year's past and I don't see us making a lot of changes for the fall.", "Seth Sigman", "Got it. Okay. And then just one question on SG&A. I think the original guidance imply minimal leverage in 2016. I think you said Q1 was going to be most difficult year to get leverage. Obviously, Q1's SG&A leverage was pretty good. Tony, are you finding other opportunities here? And is it fair to think about potentially more expense leverage throughout the year just based on the comp outlook? ", "Tony Crudele", "When we look at we obviously have a lot of initiatives that we have in place to try to drive cost out of SG&A. However, as we indicated in the first conference call as we look out over the year, we do anticipate SG&A being somewhat flattish to potentially negative and that should moderate some as we move through the year as we start to cycle against the Arizona Distribution Center and the mixing centers. And again I remind you that probably the fourth quarter we have the best potential to leverage SG&A because we have the additional sales week of the 53rd week.", "Operator", "We will take a next question from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.", "Peter Benedict", "Hey, guys. Quick question on the gross margin which was obviously really good in the quarter. I am curious about the vendor support program that we are in the -- that Greg I think you mentioned in the press release. Are those short term type things or is there some duration to that? Can you maybe help us a little bit more on what the vendor support program entail?", "Greg Sandfort ", "Yes, Peter, I am not going to get in specifics necessarily but I would say that we are constantly working with our vendors to improve not just our cost but incentives to what we do. We did go back as we knew that the Arizona Distribution Center would be somewhat costly and ask for some support there. So that's specifically Tony mentioned was a one time deal. ", "Tony Crudele ", "And so Peter this is Tony. As it flows through to our inventory and our turns generally that type of vendor support would cycle through in about three to four months period. So the majority would be captured in the first quarter. ", "Peter Benedict", "Okay. Good. That's helpful. And then Tony just with the debt it is on the balance sheet now and you gave kind of the year end target. What are you thinking in terms of interest expense for the year? And then longer term, how should we think about your appetite and leverage to this model as we go forward? Thank you. ", "Tony Crudele", "Sure. Obviously, we anticipate interest expense to increase but not dramatically because as much as we anticipate having outstanding balances at the end of each quarter. There are periods where we have obviously the strong sales as we move to spring where we would not be in a borrow position. So we don't see is being a significant increase relative to an appetite. I think that one of the biggest drivers is the share repurchase program and so that would be a driver and again given how we set up the program, using the metrics and how the stock price move dictate how much we attribute to that program. And that would drive some of the outstanding debt on the balance sheet. So I think we clearly would like to support the stock and continue to do so. But we have a lot of flexibility when it comes to the capital structure because of repurchase program. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. ", "Joshua Siber", "Hey, this is Joshua Siber on for Simeon. Can you parse out the $80 million sales difference between the Easter impact and the warm weather impact? ", "Tony Crudele", "Joshua, this is Tony. Little difficult to do and I'd tell you it is really our best estimate this time and until we see how the full season plays out, it really is just that is an estimate. Again, hard to quantify if I gave you my best thought on it, it would probably one third Easter and the other half would be considered the pull forward. But again it is really a combination of the two. So we really prefer not to parse it out. ", "Joshua Siber", "Sure. My follow up then is in the Southeast or in geographies where weather was more consistent with the norm; can you talk about what the trends look like there? Were the months evenly spread out or did March accelerate? ", "Tony Crudele", "When we look at the geographic distribution, the strong as I have mentioned on the call was the Southeast and that was -- that area was a little bit more smooth throughout the three months. But for the most part as I had indicated January strong, February a little bit softer and then obviously some strength in March itself. But in all cases all three months were positive and I wanted to say pretty much throughout all geographic locations throughout the quarter. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Jessica Mace with Nomura Securities.", "Jessica Mace", "Hi. Congrats on the nice quarter. My first question is about the health of the consumer. On your last call you made some comments about seeing some caution amongst consumers. And I was just wondering on the other side of the first quarter if you have any updates or any changes you've noticed in that behavior? ", "Tony Crudele", "Jessica, this is Tony. I'll answer that since I have such handle on the consumer themselves but I'd tell you that really our outlook hasn't changed. We are basic need company and people are coming to us for their everyday needs and that is really the consistency of our business model. As we talked about big ticket relatively consistent and again consistent with chain average for the most part in the quarter. So again we have a resilient model because of the basic needs and supporting that of the rural lifestyle and we did not see any significant changes in the consumer patterns throughout the quarter. ", "Jessica Mace", "Okay, thank you. And then my second question is on the transportation cost. I just wondered if you could review some of the moving pieces a little bit where you get a benefit from as a result of the southwest distribution center and then on some of the inbound on freight cost, what the outlook is for those and for the rest of the year? ", "Greg Sandfort ", "Certainly. When it comes to the transportation cost, the key to the Arizona Distribution Center is that obviously we are reducing the outbound 10 miles to the store and we are very successful there and we saw a reduction in those transportation cost. But obviously the inbound from many of our eastern based vendors, the inbound miles increased substantially as well. So the key to the program go forward is to make sure that we have either additional facilities of the eastern vendor base and they opened up additional facilities out West and/or we bring on western based vendors. So when -- but the key to the distribution center really is as we move forward and then the stores that we open in the West now will not have that de-leveraging impact that we experienced as we had that accelerated growth out West. So as we bring on new stores out West, they will be less impactful to our transportation cost. And that's really the key benefit to the Arizona Distribution Center. ", "Operator", "We will take a next question from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens.", "Ben Bienvenu", "Yes, thanks guys. Good afternoon. Just looking at the ticket the improvement there, you spoke to the basket getting bigger. What are some of the areas where you are seeing product merchandize resonate with customers to drive this and how sustainable do you think this trend is going forward? ", "Steve Barbarick ", "Ben, Steve Barbarick here. What I'd tell you is we got a number of different levers to drive sales and one of those is drive aisle. And that's in cap the power panels clip through the center court, Greg referenced chick days earlier in his can remarks and we also had a garden event that took place in the center court. And we are seeing really good movement in both of those events as well as getting behind and working with our vendors on our in cap programs. So that's really would help to drive some of the increase in the basket. In terms of sustainability, this is the focus for us and it's something we are getting better at. And I'd hate to tell you that I wouldn't want to suggest that this is sustainable on every quarter we talk about the gain but I can tell you we are making concerted effort to put in front the customers those impulse buys as they shop our store for needs based product.", "Ben Bienvenu", "Great. And then looking at import sales continues to nicely tick up as a percentage of total sales, what are some of the categories that are driving the majority of the growth? And then when you look out to the future where do you see a lot of opportunities? What gets you excited about continuation of that penetration rate?", "Steve Barbarick ", "Over the last few years, we've really put a concerted effort into our exclusive brand program and product development. We've got a number of agents that we worked with overseas and the team and the merchandize team has done a very nice job building our exclusive brands. If you look at some of the new things we've added for example we got in the Travelier line a new lighting set for truck accessories. We've got ground works that came in which is in our garden program. And there is a variety of things that we've been bringing that customers seemed to really respond to. So this is continuous to be a focus for us and I believe that there are still lots of room we have ahead of us. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers", "Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the spring pull forward a little bit. I mean as you step back, I mean weather overall sounded like it was probably neutral considering how it played out for you on February, as you look at the trend of the quarter. Is that fair? And as you just think about with what you're seeing in April and what you saw in March, it was March more, okay, it was warmer than last year, but in the grand scheme of things, it arrived on a more on-time basis relative to the longer history of how seasonal sets up?", "Steve Barbarick ", "When we look at the quarter, net-net we would assess that weather was positive because we had a relatively cold January and then we had the early arrival of spring in March. So as much as February was little bit warmer and sales were little bit softer. Net-net so the quarter we felt very good about the weather trends. In our case, lot has to do with how the weather related to the prior year. And so when we make the comment that one it was a much warmer March overall than in history it was also much warmer than a prior year. So it does relate -- it does impact the timing of the sales. Now when we make assessment as to what the pull forward is, we do our best to look at some of the key category and we look at sort of the slope of the sales line to try to understand if it was accelerated and try to project what that means to quarter but again really for our business it is best that we look at it by the half and we have a lot of business left and we'll probably going to make much better assessment as we move through the quarter and see how the first half comes out. ", "Christopher Horvers", "Okay. Fair enough. In last quarter there was a big discussion around Texas and the oil patch and also new store productivity with -- on the Analyst Day with some of the stores at West such as Utah. So can you talk about in terms of Texas stores and oil patch itself? Did the gap widened or did gap relative to control group, or however you want to say it, actually stabilize at the level that you saw in the fourth quarter? And then can you talk about how are you seeing new store productivity in the stores out West? Thanks. ", "Steve Barbarick ", "Sure. When it comes to the -- we will determine the oil patch store. The first thing is that transaction count remained very firm. But the difference between those stores and our control group was very consistent with what we saw in Q4. So that did not change dramatically. But it is -- we did like the performance of the stores because they were all positive in their performance relative to the control group. And we continue to drive sales through the stores for the foot traffic that we are getting. So generally what we see is that so the ticket maybe down because of some very specific type items that are sold in those areas. But day-to-day basic transactions continue to occur and drive business in those stores. ", "Greg Sandfort ", "Chris, this is Greg. As far as the western stores and respect to that new store performance particularly Utah we talked about the last call, we are still building awareness in that market. And we have an executive trip that we make every quarter with the teams and we chose this past quarter to make the trip out to the West. We were in Phoenix market, Utah market, some other western market. And I must tell you we feel very strongly that it is an awareness issue and as we are seeing the store ramp, we are feeling very good about our future prospects out there. It is about market awareness. It is about how we positioned. There has been some competition in those markets as we\u2019ve come in to them that it takes a little longer and I think we saw this a few years back when we were first entering the Florida market and the Louisiana market. So we are feeling good about it. I think the mix of our business out there is a little different than we've seen in other markets but we are figuring that out, rebalancing some of the store inventories and now with the southwest DC in position we can react to lot faster, so we are feeling very good actually about the West right now. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam Sindler", "Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Congrats as well. Tony, real quickly on some of the just financials. Are you still looking at about $8.5 million for the DC for the year? I believe that's what you guided to. And still very front half weighted?", "Tony Crudele ", "We had anticipated that would be the year-over-year drag that we would experience. So yes pretty much consistent what we've originally guided. ", "Adam Sindler", "Great. And then just as we look at gross margins over the course of the year, could you remind us why again the fourth quarter is going to have such a difficult compare despite sort of the relatively in line gross margin from last year?", "Tony Crudele", "Yes. Again relative to the fourth quarter when we analyze it and we look at all the pluses and minuses are probably about 13 to 15 different impacts on that. And really just matter of looking at those and understanding what will by cycling against and where we see the tougher compares and as much as it is difficult to breakout all those pieces for you. It just turns out that the fourth quarter we believe would be one of the tougher comparisons. ", "Adam Sindler", "Okay. Then just lastly, one thing you talk about is trying to keep on finding new products to introduce to drive some of the end caps and things like that. As you've moved more national, are there any thing maybe a local product that you've found that you've been able to bring back and take it more national? Anything from going out to the West, just outside of just opening new stores there, maybe from a merchandising standpoint?", "Steve Barbarick ", "Adam, that's a great question. I mean we are constantly in a test and learn mode. And whether it's local, whether it's testing in 25 stores, learning from it and rolling it forward, it's a constant pipeline of product that runs through the system and then gets expanded. We do all, a monthly review of all those tests that we've got going on. I'll use it one example a couple of years ago we tested kayaks", "in 50 stores and sold -- they sold pretty well, they exceeded sale through rate then we expanded it to more stores and this year all stores have kayaks and we are continue to see good momentum there. So I can't give you any one specific guidance but I could tell you that pipeline is pretty full and we are constantly reviewing the opportunity for further expansion of new merchandize. ", "Adam Sindler", "Great. And then lastly on that anything on the ammo test? Is that in the stores yet, or when will that hit? ", "Steve Barbarick ", "Well, actually, interesting you should ask, couple of weeks ago I guess maybe it was week or two ago we did roll forward with about 25 stores. Again it's still in the very early stages. Stores are still setting their merchandize and I suspect that on the next call we will be able to give you better and update. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.", "Michael Lasser", "Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So, Tony, on the $80 million should we expect that's going to all come out of the second quarter so if we just look at it last year it is about 100 basis points to the comp. So should we model whatever our comp estimate was before this quarter that we should essentially just take that down by a 100 basis points? ", "Tony Crudele ", "Michael, good question. When we look at it there is that potential, we really believe it's just too early to tell what the impact would be again it's just an estimate. If you use that $80 million and you took it out of the quarter it would represent about a 1% change in the comp sales. But again it is just our best estimate at the time and there are a lot of sales that we had so it is too difficult to just make the assessment that all of it would come out of April. ", "Michael Lasser", "And can you make any changes to your cost structure as such or it is what it is we just go with it? ", "Tony Crudele", "Obviously, we'll look at the variable expenses and which main driver would be your payroll. So we will align our payroll with what we see the sales trends are today April as we move into May. And some of that is really more trending, more current trending as we look at the sales in a particular period. But other than that the expense structure for the most part would be intact. ", "Michael Lasser", "And then Greg I just want to clarify your comments. When you talk about new store productivity you reference the western portion in United States, we've seen previously that if there were any issue with new store productivity and the lack of brand awareness, it was mostly around those stores in Utah. So is there something to have changed you viewpoint, or is it mostly semantic?", "Greg Sandfort ", "No. This new -- overall an aggregate to new stores are performing very well and they are performing at or above pro forma forecast. But in -- not just I won't just say Utah Utah, I just say in a few places in the West, we've seen little slower ramp but that's now beyond us and we are now starting to see the stores performed to a level that is acceptable to us and it kind of fits in with what we expected initially. So it's not just Utah although it was a little bit slower start initially. We are learning. The West is a new market for us. We were in California and I think before we start expansion to the West I think the furthest we were, was probably Colorado. There is lot of room in between that particular state. But we are feeling very solid now that we have -- we understand those markets better. We now have been out there a little over year of most of store base. And I think we are -- there are no concerns for us going forward with the West. ", "Tony Crudele", "And I would add Michael that when we do our calculation new store productivity, we did see an increase this quarter over Q4 last year. ", "Michael Lasser", "It was better than it was last year. So as we talked about it is in the high 60s versus this quarter 70% but that still little bit lower than they had been historically. So should we assume that as you add more stores in the West and because you've already got a base there your brand awareness is better and new store productivity should improve over time? Especially because I think you said in the past that new -- that the stores out West are actually little bit more productive once they reach total maturity. ", "Greg Sandfort ", "Yes. As we continue to grow out there in brand awareness. I think that pieces would be that it would take less time for us to gain market share as the brand becomes more aware and accepted out West. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.", "Peter Keith", "Hey, thanks for taking the question. I was curious on some of the bigger ticket trends. It sounds like weather was both the positive and negative. I guess just kind of looking forward here with some of the spring some are merchandize with lawn mowers. How do you feel about that general demand and some of the category dynamics performing here for the next few quarters? ", "Steve Barbarick ", "The big ticket itself as Tony mentioned we did see some benefit in Q1 in terms of plus numbers mainly driven by riders and as well as trailers, some of that was a bit pull forward. We feel like we've got the right assortments out there. We've gone through, we've measured right assortment, and we review our assortments. We are a need based retailer, so if there is demand I would tell you I feel pretty good about it. Tony said it's still early in the game here in Q2. And right now it's hard to assess but I'd tell you we've got the right product out in our stores. ", "Peter Keith", "Okay. Thanks for that Steve. My follow up would be just on the gross margin expansion which is obviously been observed is very good. Should we think about the margin expansion that you saw as sort of best of the year, given what sounded like there was some one-time vendor support for the DC and then maybe some benefits around that extended seasonal set? ", "Steve Barbarick ", "Okay. I'll go ahead start this one. This is Steve again. The one thing about gross margin specifically is that we got a plan. And it all starts there. We talked earlier about exclusive brands, product development, some of the import goods we got come in. We also -- our systems are much more science than art based price optimization, clearance price optimization and so in Q1 there was a shift. Tony mentioned earlier that we did have some clearance coming out of Q4. But we were able to beat that with some regular price as well as some vendor support dollars. So what I'd tell is as I feel good that we've got a plan and the teams executing to it. Tony, you have anything to add. ", "Tony Crudele", "Yes. Peter, I highlighted the vendor support relative to the distribution center because that is more of one time issue. But when we look at the margin we have a lot of real positive that occurred. And obviously Steve touched on but that the price management the import the exclusive brand was all very favorable this quarter. The fuel was positive, the way we manage promotion was much more favorable than the prior year. The way we cleared the merchandize. So net-net as much as we -- I played that one item, I would agree with the original perception that it was a very strong margin quarter for us. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.", "Seth Basham", "Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I really want to talk about comps first. Tony, if we adjust out the $18 million from the 1Q results, two-year stack basis, you're still producing comps that are north of 9%. If we were to trend that out for the rest of year, you'd be above your guidance range for the year. Is there a reason why on that adjusted basis we should assume that two-year stack comps should decelerate through the year?", "Tony Crudele", "When we look at that, Steve and I are looking at each other and I am not sure if it is a matter of how we do our forecasting and maybe some of the conservative nature in the numbers. But we will take a look at the seasons; we will take a look at how we developed our product plan throughout the year. We'll look at the year-over-year and in some cases we may actually go three years deep to look at some of the comparison. So our modeling is built from the bottom up and so we think that as much as the time it maybe a little conservative. We think that as we started the year and we continue through the years, we think that it is very reasonable guidance. ", "Steve Barbarick ", "Seth, the only thing I would add is that Q1 comparison was pretty challenging and I think we feel really good about where we came in. Tony did mention there were some pull forward. Q2 is not going to be an easy quarter either. We had a good solid comp last year and with some favorable weather so it's hard to look out and be able to forecast but I think we've got a pretty good plan in place. ", "Seth Basham", "Got you. Fair enough. And then secondly, I was hoping you could touch a little bit more on your new store plans, where you opened geographically in the first quarter, any differences in timing year-over-year, and then where you're trimming back? I think you took your guidance down by up to 5 stores for the year.", "Steve Barbarick ", "The guidance for the full year was consistent with our original guidance. Again we expect to open about 50% of the stores in the first half of the year. And 50% obviously in the back half of the year. The only difference that we see this year is that we are little bit less stores in the West. We had a very focused push over the last two years to get the number of stores, create a large base in the southwest so that we could open the distribution centers and get some of the economic benefit from that. So as we look out at this year we see few less stores in the West. We were running about 35% to 40%, we expect to be a little bit more and say the 25% range when it comes to the western stores. And additionally, we anticipate opening a few more second use real estate versus built to suit locations. And that would mean some additional capital probably maybe the $5 million to $10 million range. But those are the only two differences that we see as we move through the new store opening plan. ", "Seth Basham", "Got it. And one last follow-up if I may. Greg, you mentioned that you've learned a lot in the West and you're approaching your openings out there differently. Can you provide any color about what you're doing differently? That would be helpful.", "Greg Sandfort ", "I make it short. I think we have to keep our foot down on the pedal when it comes to marketing to make sure that we stay with these stores little longer. There are couples of things that are unique in some of these markets from merch standpoint that we've learned and we've addressed that now. And I think we become very good listeners to our teams out there. And what we are doing from a local market presence and that could be interacting with local rodeos with different 4H and FFA groups so there is a heightened what I would call awareness out there who we are now versus our initial approach. And these little different and maybe what we've done in some of the markets where we've an existing presence. It is not overbearing but those learnings we are applying.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs.", "Stephen Tanal ", "Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. If you could just size the impact of freight or transport to gross margin rate. I know you've done that in the past. I'm curious there, if you can help with that?", "Steve Barbarick ", "Yes. I can give you a general idea. I try not to break all the components down into basis points because there are so many factors that are attributed to the freight line and gross margin. So the once that I identified has having an impact or somewhat minimal impact, they were generally in the same range and generally would be less than 10 basis points of impact to the gross margin line. ", "Stephen Tanal ", "Got it. Okay. I guess as I think about it, it sounds like the inbound may be getting a little bit worse than the color that we got last quarter. Do you think that's a fair read? And separately, do you think you can start to leverage that line at some point this year, even if oil prices start to move in the other direction?", "Steve Barbarick ", "When we look out we would expect to see a similar impact in Q2 and we would expect that to start to moderate as we move through the year and start to get the benefits of the distribution center and moving some of our vendors to western ship points. So we expected to start to moderate as we move through the year but net-net for the year we expected to be just slight drag on margin. ", "Stephen Tanal ", "Got it. That's helpful. And just lastly if you could just tell us on the seasonal reset it sounds like maybe there is another change or near positive benefit in maybe 3Q or 4Q. What do you think that timing looks like if you don't mind?", "Steve Barbarick ", "Yes. I am not specifically sure. I said can you repeat the question. ", "Stephen Tanal ", "Yes. Going from three to five seasonal resets, is there another change upcoming in this year, and which quarter does that affect?", "Steve Barbarick ", "Yes. Earlier I think I have mentioned that in Q1 we were able to do that. We went from three waves in two weeks to five waves in eight. Next in the fall we are going to keep a very consistent program that what we've done traditionally. I think we are much more accurate then. So there won't be a change in the fall. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer", "Thanks. Greg wanted to follow-up on your comments about the benefits from Revionics. Are you continuing to get benefits from the initial markup module or are most of the current benefits coming from markdown management?", "Greg Sandfort ", "Dan, we are in two modules right now. Regular price and clearance. So we kind of cover both sides. We haven't turned on promotional yet. And it is not all about mark up. It is actually a combination of can we find margin or can we find can we drive sales. And so what you turn price optimization on it is an ever moving and living, increasing process and when we are moving to different markets we are going to try different things, test different price elasticity. So you are correct. You will see some improvement on mark down or clearance for that side we are seeing some improvements in our regular price pricing and how we can stay competitive in market. And it's really we needed a system because of all the different pricing strategies we got throughout the country. We are in 49 states. We are not a single regular price on everything and every state being the same. So that is another reason why we put the system in. ", "Dan Wewer", "When you think about the promotional pricing module that's available, are you committed to making that investment? And how will the pay back on that compare to the first two applications? ", "Greg Sandfort ", "At this point in time we have not made a decision that we would move forward with a promotional pricing module. We are still working to the first two. If we do make that decision then you can bet that we are going to see some type of return on investment or we wouldn't do it. ", "Dan Wewer", "And then Tony, just to follow up once more on the sales pull forward comment. Are you seeing anything in the results in April that would confirm that you moved some revenues from April into March?", "Tony Crudele", "There could be some potential. And again that goes into our calculation and estimate of the $80 million. Obviously, again a little bit difficult assessment because as we moved into April the weather was little cooler. So there was an impact there. So we are constantly assessing as we move through the quarter but obviously as this warm weather is moved in we are really optimistic about the May and June and timeframe and our spring assortment. ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "Good afternoon, everyone. Nice quarter. Could you talk a little bit about how some of the marked down discipline you took in the fourth quarter set you up for the first quarter and how you make sure inventory weren't too low going into the first quarter? Especially the seasonal merchandize. ", "Steve Barbarick ", "Yes. Chuck, this is Steve Barbarick. There are two types of seasonal merchandize. There is product that we bought for Christmas is not necessarily cold product related. And we sold through that really well. It was the more seasonal clearance that we ended up carrying over and I believe at that the last call we talked about the percentage that we carried over. A lot of retailers would have probably taken marked down a lot quicker and panic to some degree. But a lot of the product that we have our whole good that are pretty much standby is year-to-year. And we took a very disciplined approach. We didn't panic in Q4; we took methodical mark down where we could. We do have a clearance price optimization that looks specifically at clearance by individual location so we can cluster those types of products. When we got into the first quarter we had the benefit of that winter. Colder weather hit us from January. And we had enough of merchandize up north knowing that we went for these five waves of allocation. And it really paid off for us. Now we still are carrying some of that inventory over. I don't want to say that we sold completely through but it's good inventory that we can bring out for next year and the carry over is minimal compared to the total inventory investment that we have out there today. So the team did a really nice job. I think it was a discipline approach. We use both art and science based on some of what we are looking at and we came out of it really well. ", "Tony Crudele", "And regarding the five ways from my perspective in northeast Ohio, I think some of that like it looks like the chick programs come in later here this year than last. That would be maybe part of it. I'd tell you where you would see the biggest and most significant impact is really more in the seasonal, some of the power equipment and things like that. So where we would have set stores probably in new area in early February the stores would have been set a little bit later up north towards the end of February. And the southern stores really benefited because they actually got product two weeks earlier than what they traditionally would have gotten products. So as Greg said earlier we were able to capitalize on an earlier spring in the south and keep some of that quarter related merchandize out on the floor through really the month of February and start setting spring at that point. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Hey, guys. How are you? Great. A bit of strategic question. I know it is kind of talked around and a lot of weather-related questions, but when you wind up getting the kind of weather impact that you did in the first quarter, does that change how you plan your merchandising or inventory sets for 2Q?", "Steve Barbarick ", "Again, this is Steve Barbarick. We set for a season. We don't set necessarily for a quarter. And our quarters are while they are fiscal they are kind of calendar so that March, April timeframe you never know. There is always a bit of shift. So we look at the season and we manage to season. We don't necessarily manage our inventories to quarter. ", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Okay. That makes sense. And then just a quick follow-up for Tony. Something people have asked about previously, and just wondering if you had any more recent thoughts on it, is the potential ability to improve payables to inventory ratio and potentially take some working capital out of your operation. You had inventory up by $100 million, payables essentially flat. Just wondering what's the right way to think about the payable to inventory ratio going forward, and again, what is the opportunity set there?", "Tony Crudele", "Yes. Scot, I absolutely agree with you and I think you should continue to call Steve Barbarick on that. But we do have some plans in place but I would agree whole heartily it is something that we need to have more discipline around and be more aggressive relative to that because it clearly is sort of the one whole back when it comes to-- there are returns on invested capital. ", "Operator", "We will take a next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Joe Feldman", "Hi, guys. Thanks. Just wanted to ask about the loyalty program. That is one something I don't think we talked about today, just latest trends. I know at the Analyst Day, you said it was about 140 stores in the test mode, and just any more data or color you could share would be helpful.", "Steve Barbarick ", "Happy to do it Joe. We are in -- as you mentioned 140 stores, we got about six months now of earning and what I would tell you is that the opting rate by our consumers have actually exceeded original expectations. We knew that we had fairly loyal customer and it wasn't really till we have the program out there that we realize that they were very interested and wanting to hear from us and being part of a program. In the stores that we've had in ", "We've seen nice attribution increases and understanding who are our customer is and getting a deeper knowledge. Now just give you a couple of examples. In the stores where we got the Neighbors Club program from a transaction standpoint we went from really about mid 30s to mid 50s, so we've seen nice increase in transaction attribution and in sales attribution that numbers go up from the little 50s to the mid 60s. We are using that data now because the goal of this was to collect the information and then start personalizing communication after them using email. And we've been doing just that. We've got now record of the response rates from our customers. And the communication back and forth regarding either content or special offers or trying to get them into the shop across the store. So we are very enthusiastic about the program and at this point we are looking forward next step. We don't yet; we are not prepared to make a comment as to where we are going roll it or how many stores will get it. But we are optimistic that this is something that's going to add value. ", "Joe Feldman", "That's great. Good, thanks for the update on that. And then so one another quick question. Any also an update on some of the pet resets that you have done in terms of maybe lift and if there is any kind of way you can see what's been driving, how much that's driven comp or--?", "Steve Barbarick ", "Well, I won't get into the specifics Joe but I would tell you Greg mentioned it earlier. Our customer's index is very high when it comes to animal ownership. And that includes dogs and cats as well. And we go through a pretty rigorous category management review of the pet aisle supplies, treat as well as pet food every year and in some cases twice a year. We are seeing growth. We look at three different segments. We look at the grocery segment, we look at the science segment and we look at the premium, super premium segments. And I would tell you we are seeing growth in all three of those segments. We put a lot of our real estate as well as some of our marketing into the super premium side of the business in our investments. And we think we are getting a very nice pay off. Customers are responding favorably and I think that's one of the things that maybe growing our transaction count. We talk a lot about CUE and being needs based and this would be example of that. ", "Operator", "And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Sandfort, at this point I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. ", "Greg Sandfort ", "Thank you, operator. As we look ahead to 2016, we continue to be excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Tractor Supply. We are pleased with the first quarter results and the year is off to a good solid start. But there is still a lot of business ahead as Tony mentioned. We will continue to invest in our infrastructure, our system improvements and our omni channel business as we target mid-teens EPS growth. Thank you for your support of our company. We look forward to speaking to you again in July regarding our second quarter performance. ", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Christine, please go ahead.", "Christine Skold", "Thanks, Tom.

Greg, please go ahead.", "Greg Sandfort", "Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer and Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising Officer.", "As you are all aware from our pre-release on June 29, we had a challenging second quarter, not the typical Tractor Supply performance. And clearly, the weather was not favorable. The bottom line is our business was heavily influenced by weather in Q2. We have worked very hard to be the most dependable supplier of products to the rural lifestyle customer. And the fact remains that some of those products, being seasonal in nature, can be impacted by weather. Weather has always been a factor in our business and we know it\u2019s our job to manage around those external factors. However, we generally have not experienced the extreme conditions in variability in the weather from region to region like we saw in this second quarter. Hot and dry in the West, cold and wet in the East and Midwest and severe flooding and damage in the South Central. Just about every region experienced some form of weather variance and the conditions were very different from region to region.", "When the weather began to normalize in June, so did our business, but the turn was not enough to offset the weakness in April and May and not enough for us to anticipate that a significant shift in seasonal sales will occur coming into the third quarter. As a result, we have become a bit more cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year, although last year\u2019s sales comparisons are more favorable in the second half. During the quarter, very strong demand for our core animal and pet offerings continued and we believe we are gaining share in these areas. We also saw continued momentum with events that directly support the sustainable lifestyle. Chick Days and our garden event both experienced strong year-over-year growth.", "We saw healthy demand for outdoor furniture, pest and rodent control products, barbecue grills, but unfavorable weather and a difficult year-over-year sales comparison challenged our ability to drive sales providing lawnmowers, lawn and garden products and utility vehicles. We did see increased demand in departments where we continued to innovate and introduce newness such as truck lighting and accessories, trailers and outdoor water recreation. Our inventory and planning teams did an excellent job reacting to the softer sales trends in the quarter and through a balanced approach managed the sales margin and inventory investment in relationship to customer demand.", "Tractor Supply will continue to invest in our business to drive sales, shorten our supply chain timeline and increase our overall productivity and profitability as a company. In addition to implementing an improved allocation system, we are continuing our test and learn process on the merchandise side, expanding our new customer loyalty program pilot, growing our store mobile point-of-sale test and conducting a comprehensive DC network analysis. And we are pleased with the progress we are making on all of these initiatives. Just this month, we expanded the test of our Neighbors Club customer loyalty program to the California market and now have over 190 stores participating. While still early in the process, the initial enrollment rates continue to be ahead of our expectations. We are finding that our Neighbors Club members are highly engaged to a tractor and we are experiencing higher open and click-through rates on our targeted e-mails and communications to them.", "We have now completed the implementation of our new allocation system. The new system is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of our allocation process and is scalable to support our long-term store growth targets. We continue to expand the test of mobile POS devices into our stores. And as the functionality has improved, the adaptation from our team members and customers have also increased. This capability will enable us and our team members to sell and assist customers with products from any point in or outside our stores. And lastly, we are continuing the analysis of our DC network and systems, which we believe will be critical in supporting our growth to 2,500 stores and evolving our supply chain strategy and capability for the longer term.", "Overall, we believe these and other investments have made our business more nimble and less susceptible to external factors. But recent results remind us that extreme weather conditions from region to region can impact our business in the short-term and this is not likely to change. We continue to manage the business with the future in mind and believe continuous improvement in our product and service offerings in addition to improving systems and efficiencies will keep Tractor Supply well positioned for growth.", "Looking forward into the second half of the year, we are a bit more cautious. Despite the more normalized trends in June, we do not believe that we will see much of an extended spring selling season to recoup the sales loss in the second quarter. We revised our full year guidance in our June 29 business update press release and are reiterating that guidance today. Tony will take you through this in greater detail in a moment. From a product and inventory perspective, we believe we are in a solid position to meet the needs of our customers as we transition the business from summer to fall.", "And before I wrap up, I want to thank the nearly 23,000 members of the Tractor Supply team for their continued hard work and dedication to our customers and our overall business. I also want to congratulate Tony on his planned retirement and Kurt Barton on his planned promotion to CFO.", "As we announced in today\u2019s earnings press release, Tony has notified the company that he plans to retire during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Kurt Barton, the company\u2019s Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, will succeed Tony as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Kurt has been with Tractor Supply for 17 years and is a talented financial leader with a proven track record of creating value. We all have the utmost confidence in his ability to continue leading the financial team forward. To ensure a smooth transition of duties, Kurt and Tony will work together over the next 7 months, with Kurt increasing his interface with the investment community through investor meetings and calls in the back half of the year.", "I will now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed commentary on our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2016.", "Tony Crudele", "Thanks, Greg and good afternoon everyone. For the quarter ended June 25, 2016, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.85 billion, net income grew 2% to $156.4 million and EPS increased 3.6% to $1.16 per diluted share. Comp store sales decreased 0.5% in the second quarter compared to a very strong increase of 5.6% in last year\u2019s second quarter. Comp store sales were challenged throughout the quarter, with April and May impacted primarily from unfavorable weather patterns and tough comparisons from prior year. Beginning with Memorial Day weekend and warmer weather, seasonal sales trends normalized and comp store sales were in line with our expectations in the month of June. Sales were the weakest in the Northern regions of the country, where unseasonably cool temperatures reduced demand for many spring items. The Southern regions, which were less impacted by the cooler weather, performed more consistently with our expectations and had positive comps except for the Texas region.", "In addition to the impact of the oil patch economy, certain areas of Texas were negatively impacted by heavy rains and flooding, which limited some of the spring season activities. Comp transaction count increased for the 33rd consecutive quarter, gaining 1.5% on top of a 4.2% increase last year as C.U.E. items such as pet and animal food continued to post high single-digit comps. Average comp ticket decreased by 190 basis points compared to last year\u2019s 130 basis point increase. Big ticket drove last year\u2019s increase and was the principal driver of this year\u2019s average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items declined approximately 8.5% as big ticket items such as riding lawn mowers and utility vehicles were challenged due to strong comparisons to last year and this year\u2019s unfavorable selling conditions. Deflation also had a slight impact on average ticket and contributed approximately 25 basis points to the decrease.", "Now turning to gross margin, which decreased 23 basis points to 35% compared to a 50 basis point improvement in last year\u2019s second quarter. Product mix had a negative impact on margin. Although margin benefited from soft sales of some of the key big ticket items such as riding lawn mowers, this benefit was more than offset by the soft sales in other high margin departments and the strong sales of lower margin C.U.E. items. With respect to margin rate, while promotion cadence was relatively consistent with last year with the exception of a friends and neighbors event, we were slightly sharper on price to drive sales. Freight was unfavorable as an increase in inbound transportation costs more than offset the benefits from lower diesel prices and a reduction in the outbound stem miles. We estimate deflation had a slight favorable impact on gross margin.", "For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales de-levered by 15 basis points to 21.6% of sales compared to 21.4% of sales in the prior year\u2019s quarter. SG&A growth was impacted by several factors. The deleverage was primarily due to the lower comparable sales results as SG&A expense grew only 5.2% from the prior year. Excluding incentive compensation expense, SG&A expense increased 6.7%, which is below the SG&A growth rate over the past several quarters. We experienced strong cost control in personnel, including store level, distribution center and store support payroll as well as medical expense. Occupancy expense was well managed as we began to benefit from our LED lighting retrofit. The strong expense management was achieved against the headwind from our Arizona distribution center that was not open at this time last year. We estimate the deleverage from this center\u2019s operation to be approximately 15 basis points. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.8% in Q2 compared to 37.2% last year due to additional federal and the state tax credits.", "Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of Q2 this year we had cash balance of $151.1 million and $196.2 million in outstanding debt, principally comprised of the term loan compared to a cash balance of $56 million and no outstanding debt last year. During the second quarter, we had limited purchases under our stock repurchase program. Average inventory levels per store decreased 1.2% compared to 4.1% increase in last year\u2019s second quarter and inventory turns decreased compared to last year. We had strong inventory management in the quarter considering the soft sales environment. The transition between second and third quarters generally does not have significant markdown exposure. We are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into the third quarter and we expect a normal markdown cadence exiting the season. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $64.3 million compared to $48.2 million last year. We opened 22 stores and closed 1 Del\u2019s store in the second quarter compared to 17 new stores and one closed store in the second quarter of 2015. The CapEx increase relates to our new store expansion, which includes an emphasis on retrofit locations that generally require renovation capital and our LED lighting retrofit project.", "Now looking ahead, based on the trends and results for the first half of the year, we revised our outlook for the full year fiscal 2016 in our June 29 business update. We are reiterating that outlook today. We expect full year sales to range from $6.8 billion to $6.9 billion, comparable store sales to increase between 2.5% and 3.5% and net income to range from $451 million to $456 million with earnings per diluted share to be $3.35 to $3.40. Assumed in this guidance is an EBIT margin improvement of about 10 basis points to 15 basis points, a tax rate of 36.8% and capital expenditures of $230 million to $250 million. We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $134.5 million to $134.8 million. In our June 29 business update, we stated that although June sales were more normalized, we did not expect a shift of spring sales into the third quarter. While it is still early in the third quarter, the trends through the first few weeks of July would appear to support this expectation. From a comparison standpoint in the third quarter, we face our toughest year-over-year comparison in July and our easiest comparison is in September.", "As a reminder, we had a record mild winter last year and therefore, we believe that any upside in our forecast will be in the fourth quarter. We also have our 53rd week and an additional comp sales day in the fourth quarter. The additional sales week will provide incremental expense leverage in the fourth quarter and we estimate that the additional week will provide $0.03 to $0.04 increase to EPS, which is contained in our guidance. In our original full year guidance, we have forecasted $0.01 negative EPS impact from the closing of several Del\u2019s stores in the fourth quarter as part of our transition to Tractor Supply stores in Washington State. We have now made the decision to close those stores closer to their lease expiration, with most of them expiring in 2017. We are pleased with the performance to-date of the Tractor Supply stores that we have opened in the former Del\u2019s markets. We continue to expect limited deflation in the back half of the year in the 15 basis point to 20 basis point range.", "As we look at the back half of the year, we expect improvement of EBIT margin driven principally by improved gross margin in both the third and fourth quarters and expense leverage from the 53rd week. While transportation expenses will continue to be a headwind as we cycle the decline in diesel prices, we expect our gross margin initiatives to continue to drive improvement. With respect to SG&A, we were very pleased with our expense management in Q2. We will continue to drive cost saving programs in the back half and we will react accordingly to sales trends, but we would expect year-over-year increase in SG&A to track closer to the overall growth in sales. We expect to maintain the appropriate payroll allocation to drive sales in the back half and incur a more normalized incentive compensation expense. We will continue to have the headwind of the Arizona distribution center until we cycle its opening in late December.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.", "Steven Forbes", "Hey guys.", "Greg Sandfort", "Hello Steven.", "Steven Forbes", "As it relates to the top line performance over the past few quarters across the different regions and you briefly touched on it, but is there anything you are learning from the region with the loyalty card \u2013 with the loyalty program as it relates to weather and just general consumer behaviors during these unique weather events, what I am trying to get at, is there any \u2013 is there less variability right in the region where you have those \u2013 where you have the loyalty program in consumer trends and behavior because your ability to communicate with the consumer \u2013 or is the region \u2013 is it really not that different?", "Greg Sandfort", "Steven this is Greg. It\u2019s really early for us to say that we have seen anything significant because of it, but what I can tell you is that the reason we took \u2013 the program expanded to California is it \u2013 we really liked what we are seeing in Michigan with the engagement and how the customers are responding to it very openly. So, we want to move it to California to take it another step. And I think 6 months from now we will probably have a better idea to give you some ideas of how it is impacting. We don\u2019t have enough data yet to say that we can use that to really reach back to customers and either poll them for information about how they are feeling or what they are buying or not buying. So, it\u2019s now just gathering the data and getting them into the database, to be honest.", "Steven Forbes", "And then as a follow-up, maybe as it relates to the merchandising since we are really 2 days away, I believe from the next open buying day. Can you just briefly talk about what departments in your mind right as of today represent the greatest revenue margin opportunity, especially from a productivity standpoint in the box? I mean, I know from our pricing in our reports and from our own visits, paddles seems to stick out just given the space allocation. But heading into an event like the open buying day on Friday and so forth, is there \u2013 are there anything that you guys can talk about that you are looking forward to or you see a lot of opportunity from a merchandising side?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes, Steve. This is Steve again. Hey, what I would tell you is that it\u2019s kind of two-pronged here. The advantage of the open buying day is this. We are going to get an opportunity to see 300, 400 folks come through and talk to our teams, all of which are doing business with Tractor Supply today and really getting a better understanding of what\u2019s going on in the marketplace, because most of these folks, either seller or competitors or they are somewhere else out there that we can get a better read on what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. Everyone who signs up, we will give some time, too. And so we don\u2019t really narrow it down into any one given category. In terms of what we are looking at in the box itself to move our business forward, we have talked a lot about the C.U.E. business. And you will see a number of resets that are going to take place in the back half of this year that will support that, whether it would be what we are doing in feed with the launch of our Do More equine program or what we are going to see in terms of Blue Seal, which will expand out to another couple of hundred stores in the Northeast and down the corridor. So, there is a lot of things that are happening within the box right now, not just in terms of resets, but also events such as Deer Feeding that we have got out there right now that\u2019s doing particularly well or the Stock Your Shop tool event. And in that then itself, we are going to have about 60% new products that we didn\u2019t have a year ago to really give our customers a treasure hunt experience. So, I could go on and on about all the things that we are working on, but I would say across the board, we have got a lot of things cooking.", "Steven Forbes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Alan Rifkin with BTIG.", "Alan Rifkin", "Thank you very much. And Tony, best of luck in your retirement. Certainly, you made it abundantly clear the impact of weather on the business, particularly in that first two periods of the quarter. I guess, can you maybe shed a little bit more color then why, if you feel so strongly it is weather-related, you are incrementally more cautious for the second half? And then I do have a follow-up.", "Greg Sandfort", "Alan, this is Greg. Couple of things to note. The second quarter was difficult and there was just incredibly, let\u2019s say, challenging weather in some of the regions of the country, where we have typically been able to weather those storms in the past, but I will give you an example in Texas, very, very difficult, massive flooding, lot of destruction. That will take time for that market to come back. It\u2019s not \u2013 it doesn\u2019t snapback tomorrow. So, our feeling was, let\u2019s be a little more conservative as we go in the second half. We know it\u2019s going to take some time for a large market like that where we have 170 plus stores to recover. And we \u2013 and as we talked amongst ourselves, our feeling was we are always kind of a conservative group here. We would rather be more conservative and give ourselves an opportunity to exceed that than to say, well, we think \u2013 we can\u2019t forecast the future. We could only kind of deal with the past and try to look at that and understand what could be in front of us. So, that\u2019s really \u2013 we are just \u2013 we are being a little more conservative given the fact that we had such a difficult second quarter with the weather variations.", "Alan Rifkin", "Okay. And as a follow-up, so if we were to dissect your business in another way, namely, classes of stores added in more recent years, let\u2019s call it, 2013, \u201814, \u201815, are the stores that were added in those classes possibly more susceptible to the weather than prior classes?", "Tony Crudele", "Well, Alan, this is Tony. We generally \u2013 other than in sort of \u201814 and \u201815, where we were trying to build our base out in the Southwest to create the volume for our Arizona distribution center, we generally are very geographically dispersed. So, I don\u2019t think there was a particular emphasis. And in this case, the Southwest has performed very well for us and so there is less of a concern. Obviously, if you ran into a significant drought situation in a particular area of the country, that may have an impact, but generally because of the geographic disbursement of the stores, we tend to be somewhat insulated from one \u2013 some particular area of the country having some weather event.", "Alan Rifkin", "Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.", "Peter Benedict", "Hey, guys. Thanks and congrats Tony. Best of luck. First question, just to clarify, on the Del closings, I think you have 13 of those stores left. Are you going to \u2013 are you closing any of the balance of the year or are they all going to be in \u201817? Just can you help us with that?", "Steve Barbarick", "Sure. Right now, it looks like there is a few that are scheduled for the back half, so it\u2019s more like just two or three. And that will leave about, I want to say 10 to 12 for next year and they will be spread throughout the year and a lot of them again in the back half. But when we looked at it and we saw that some of the stores actually are performing well, we haven\u2019t had a match necessarily of a Tractor Supply store coming into that marketplace, we just felt it would be more prudent to leave them opened until they come closer to their lease termination date.", "Peter Benedict", "Okay. You had mentioned that there was a $0.01 hit to earnings that was embedded in your guidance, I think you said at the beginning of the year, but that\u2019s not in there now. Is it \u2013 did I hear you correctly?", "Tony Crudele", "Correct. And so that would be the one area where we had $0.01 pickup in the back half of the year relative to our original forecast and that\u2019s probably part of the conservativism in the back half that we did not pick up that $0.01 in our forecast.", "Peter Benedict", "Right, got it. Understood. And then the next question is just around the DC analysis, Greg that you are talking about. When can we expect kind of more color on maybe some developments that would come from that? I am also thinking about an update around the mixing centers, what your plans are from that perspective?", "Greg Sandfort", "Okay, Peter. First of all, we have been in this process of analysis working with Avista for 6 months, I think, Steve?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes.", "Greg Sandfort", "Close to that. And we now have their results and their suggestions and we are now going through that saying, okay, what looks plausible and what would the timing really be and how do we move forward? If you remember correctly, we did a similar project about 6 years ago. And that helped us understand the next wave of growth for the company and we got a little ahead of the curve on building buildings and systems, infrastructure and so on. This is the next step again to take us forward. So, you will know more about this. We will speak more to this on the next call, because we just got the results and we are still digesting it.", "Peter Benedict", "Okay, great. Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.", "Seth Sigman", "Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. And Tony, congrats. Twofold questions here. First, just on the sales, so it sounds like the conservative view is somewhat based on what you have seen early in the third quarter. The weather did improve a bit in June and then into July. So, I am just wondering, is there something else happening here where maybe there is some timing dynamic where consumers just end up delaying certain big ticket purchases that they may have missed out on earlier in the season? Is that part of what\u2019s happening here early in the third quarter?", "Tony Crudele", "Yes, Seth. This is Tony. Based on our prepared remarks, the message that we are trying to send is that as we move through the quarter, we are hopeful that with sort of the softness in April and May that we would see a little bit stronger bounce back in June. We did not see that. So, as part of our update on \u2013 in our June 29 business update, we had anticipated that we would not see significant spring sales falling in the July time period. So \u2013 and the last three weeks has verified that expectation. So, we expect it will be limited as we move through the rest of the quarter. And obviously, our easiest compare is in the September timeframe and a lot of that can be driven by cooler weather as people start to ramp up for the winter season. And right now, we expect that it will be cooler in September than last year, but still will be warmer than normal. So obviously, it\u2019s just too early to have an indication as to the third quarter.", "Seth Sigman", "Okay, got it. And then I just want to follow-up on Peter\u2019s question about the network analysis that you are doing, is there a scenario here where you need to significantly increase your spending or do you feel like the earnings growth algorithm that you have laid out previously should account for any potential investments that you need to make?", "Greg Sandfort", "Seth, this is Greg. That analysis \u2013 that\u2019s the part of the analysis we are working through right now as far as what looks plausible. When you \u2013 anytime you do all these analyses, they do every \u2013 it\u2019s ran on a model of the perfect scenario, correct. Nothing is a perfect scenario. And we have some buildings in places that honestly, if we want to look \u2013 went back 10 years ago, we may not have put them in this city, maybe we put it in a city 200 miles to the East, North or the West. So that\u2019s what we are sorting through right now. We do believe that the cost of this as we go forward will be part of our capital plan that we have had and we continue to invest through in this \u2013 the next leg of the growth. So yes, we believe it will be part of that plan. And again, we will share more of this with you. And when we get to the third quarter call, we will have all this sorted through at that time.", "Seth Sigman", "Okay, prefect. Best of luck in the back half.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.", "Michael Lasser", "Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question and congrats Tony.", "Tony Crudele", "Thank you.", "Michael Lasser", "Greg, there have been points in the past where Tractor Supply has been burdened by the weather, but it was able to power through it either because store base is maturing and driving growth or because it still had a plethora of merchandising activities and new products introduced, is there a case where maybe just given the company\u2019s size or stage of development, it\u2019s harder now to overcome external factors like the weather?", "Greg Sandfort", "No, Michael. I would tell you that we have looked at this and looked at this and no that it would not be the case. There is plenty of newness, plenty of things that we are bringing to the customer. But we have all looked back and did some studying of the last several years of weather trends and things. And it\u2019s just become a little bit more I will call it, unpredictable, meaning that it\u2019s moving the sales around a little bit more than we thought. And so we are reacting to that fairly well, keeping our inventories in control and moving our assortments to the product categories of the customers willing to buy and want to buy. But no I don\u2019t think the size has anything really to do with it. We are still as nimble as we were. We saw plenty of newness. So I think this is us learning something new about how we need to react as these \u2013 I think what we are going to see is more and more of this type of weather patterning and it\u2019s a new learning to be very honest.", "Michael Lasser", "Maybe that being said, is there anything you could have done differently to help drive a better comp during the quarter?", "Greg Sandfort", "I don\u2019t think so, because when you look at the weather patterns in the parts of the country that it affected and how it affected them, we managed the inventories extremely well by region. So I think we did that part extremely well. And to say that there was other opportunities that we may have missed on boy, we looked at it very thoroughly, Steve and the team spent hours and we took advantage of every opportunity that was there. The customer demand just didn\u2019t develop in second quarter. That\u2019s the answer.", "Michael Lasser", "And then on the new store productivity, which also has been trending a bit below average, was that metric impacted by the weather or is that still a lingering effect of some of the lack of brand awareness on the West Coast?", "Tony Crudele", "Michael, this is Tony. We actually are pleased with where we are with the new store productivity. It plateaued pretty much over the last three quarters and the stores out West are performing better. I think that as we cycle through, you will see that the newer stores that we have opened this year are again exceeding pro forma. And we should be able to maintain that new store productivity if not increase it.", "Michael Lasser", "Got it. Thanks again.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers", "Thanks. Good evening. You mentioned that you were a bit more sharper on price in adding friends and neighbor event, was that mainly in response to the spring seasonal business and as you have transitioned away from that time of year for that business, are you back to a comparable I guess promotional and pricing posture on a year-over-year basis?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. Chris, so this is Steve Barbarick. And one of the things that we have talked a lot about, Tractor Supply being a fairly nimble company and we are able to react pretty quickly to the needs of our consumer. And what we saw in the Q2 in the softness in a lot of the seasonal businesses, we felt like we needed to react with something. So we did put a promotional piece out there as Tony referred to. As we look forward, we are going to continue to use all the arrows in our quiver to best support the business. And whether that be using inventory to help move our business forward, it could be looking at additional promotional pieces and it could be a variety of things. Maybe it\u2019s getting more targeted around some of the C.U.E. businesses. Another thing that we are doing is local presentation. So right now, where it\u2019s hot and dry out West, we have got our store teams out there, putting together water movement and fans and things that we are doing down in Texas. So we are constantly moving the business around based on the needs of the consumer. I am not suggesting that we are going to steer one way any \u2013 too far any one way because we use a balanced approach and we have got plenty of initiatives that move us forward. But I also don\u2019t want to rule anything out either.", "Christopher Horvers", "Okay, understood. Well, I guess to clarify that I mean that response is going to make people think that you are being \u2013 continue to be more promotional and it\u2019s a reaction to current demand trends, so is that the message that we are expected to understand?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. I wouldn\u2019t suggest that whatsoever. I mean we have run our business the same way we have since I have been here and that\u2019s been for the last 18 years. And I wouldn\u2019t want anybody to think that we are going to steer one way any too far, one way left or one way right. We try to present value to our customers day-in, day-out. And that\u2019s what they come in for. So again, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into that.", "Christopher Horvers", "Understood. And then as you think about the oil patch and the performance of the stores, you had baked in lapping that, I think it fell off \u2013 those stores really fell off at the end of the third quarter, as you looked over the first half of this year, how was your outlook for those \u2013 the performance of those stores as we start to lap the fall-off later, has anything changed and are we expecting them to return to positive?", "Tony Crudele", "Sure, Chris. This is Tony. When we look at the last three quarters, their performance relative to the control group has been relatively consistent. So the impact on the comps has been again, relatively consistent for the last three quarters. As we move forward, we will start cycling in. And I agree with what you said that we really started to see sort of that fall-off in the third and fourth quarters. So as much as we do anticipate that it will moderate, we do believe that it will still be a drag in the back half of the year, but not to the extent that it has been in the first half.", "Christopher Horvers", "Understood. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.", "Simeon Gutman", "Thanks and congratulations Tony. Were there any undertones that discretionary spending is slowing or the weather just make it very difficult to judge that?", "Greg Sandfort", "Simeon, let me take that one. I would tell you that what we saw in the second quarter, we could directly tie that back to the weather and how it slowed the development of some of the businesses. We had a very favorable end of March. And it seems like since we got \u2013 and we had that early Easter shift. And it looks like we had a bit of a reversal in trends, all of a sudden, April and May versus where we were at the end of March. And we started seeing some pullback a little bit on big ticket because we had seen a good pull forward at the end of first quarter. So we thought well, that\u2019s just going to be a trade-off between a couple of months. But as we said in the 29th update, we really haven\u2019t seen anything significant with the customers\u2019 use of credit or shift to spending and so on and so forth at this point. It\u2019s fundamentally they are still buying the things they need, they are still shopping for us, our traffic counts are up. So, it was a bit of a tough pill to swallow when we saw the business just not develop and then, again, little warmness in June and we saw a nice push again in the business. So, it\u2019s just very unusual, but no, I can\u2019t say that we have anything that would give us any indication that there is some current trend with the consumer, because we would have seen some of the signals and we haven\u2019t seen it. Our core business couldn\u2019t be stronger.", "Simeon Gutman", "Okay. And then my follow-up on inventory\u2019s gross margin, Tony, made a comment regarding the third quarter that there is not a big transitional quarter, a big markdown quarter. I guess you are not getting the pickup in seasonal July. One, is there some carryover risk from those items? And then if we do see some \u2013 when we talk in the third quarter, if we do hear that there was some markdown, what would explain that? Our markdown during the quarter, what would have explained that or is that just likely out of the question?", "Steve Barbarick", "Simeon, Steve Barbarick here. I thought the team did a really nice job managing to the demands of the business. And we saw that early and we are able to pullback in a lot of the ordering. And our seasonal inventories are in a great position right now for spring. So, I have very little concern about markdown or clearance going into the third quarter or fourth quarter for spring product.", "Simeon Gutman", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Incorporated.", "Ben Bienvenu", "Yes, thanks. Good afternoon and congratulations, Tony.", "Tony Crudele", "Great, thank you.", "Ben Bienvenu", "So, just following on that question as it relates to inventory and some of the variability that we have seen around weather. Has there been any deviation or evolution in the number of resets that you anticipate to do for the fall selling period or do you anticipate sticking with that traditional reset cadence?", "Greg Sandfort", "We went back and we looked at what we are doing in the back half of this year and looked at the categories that maybe most impacted that we think that our customers still have a lot of demand for. And we have modified our approach slightly, but it\u2019s really around some key areas. And I feel really good about the reset work that we are going to be doing. So, it is around a lot of the C.U.E. merchandise. But in addition to that, we went back, we have reset our stores for footwear and leather and in rubber. We have got heating resets that are going to be taking place and assortment adjustments there as well. So generally, when you look across the four walls, I feel very confident that the work the team is doing is going to be in line with what we are seeing our customer demand for.", "Ben Bienvenu", "Okay, great. And then you touched in the past on some ammo tests in a handful of stores. I would be curious to hear how that\u2019s progressing? And then any change in thought process either around extending the number of stores that offer that SKU set and/or potentially adding firearms of some kind to your assortment?", "Greg Sandfort", "Yes. I would tell you, at this point, it\u2019s still early in the test. It\u2019s in 25 stores and we are getting some results now. We still need to dissect it and determine whether or not it meets our threshold for being a successful test, so that it would roll forward in more stores. In terms of firearms, it\u2019s way too early in the game to even talk about that. So, I would leave that for future date.", "Ben Bienvenu", "Fair enough. Thanks and best of luck.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.", "Peter Keith", "Hey, thanks. Good afternoon and my congratulations as well to Tony and to Kurt also. I want to just look at the mix dynamic in Q2. Far back as I can remember when you have had these late springs or colder springs, you usually have had this mix benefit because of the lower OPE sales. It seemed like there was a bit of a change here in Q2 and you identified there was some higher margin items. Could you just maybe provide some more specifics there and anything that\u2019s kind of surprised you on the weakness?", "Tony Crudele", "Sure. When it comes to the bigger ticket, we definitely had a benefit, in particular, when it came to the riding mower category. So, the softer sales in that category did help margin, because it is well below chain average. When we look at some of the other key departments, obviously, the first thing that comes to mind is the strength of the C.U.E. items, in particular, the animal feed and pet food, which have just a slightly below chain average margin. But that strength obviously de-levers on margin. So, that had a negative impact. And then when you look at some of the other spring items that are higher margin, that were soft as well and even some of the other hard line items, the softness in those sales, we didn\u2019t obviously pickup the margin there as well. So, those two factors offset the benefit that we get on the larger ticket hard line category.", "Peter Keith", "And anything there, in that last comment, Tony, that was different from previous cold springs?", "Tony Crudele", "Generally, we would have some key categories of spring that would sell well. In this case, some of those categories, we didn\u2019t get that lift. So, we would generally get some offset. And so it just \u2013 we just didn\u2019t have the same lift that we would get from the other higher key categories. I know Steve has some comments that he would like to make.", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. A year ago, when we were sitting here talking about the strength of the business, a lot of it was driven by seasonal and a lot of it was driven \u2013 we had a new OPE lineup. We saw demand across the board in trailers and a lot of other categories. And we were comping that this year, in all fairness. And to your stack, I think you would feel really good about, but unfortunately, we are comping ourselves and we \u2013 that\u2019s what we need to be doing and we didn\u2019t do it like we should have this quarter. But if you looked at the totality of the business, it\u2019s still strong, there are some very strong fundamentals in the business, but we are lapping what was a very robust Q2 last year in the seasonal category.", "Peter Keith", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Steve, while I have you, too, so you have mentioned you have rolled out the new and improved inventory allocation system, do you have any early wins or insights you could share and how might that benefit the back half of the year?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. It\u2019s rolled out now to the entire team. And I would tell you I really do think it\u2019s going to have a positive impact on the business. It\u2019s really going to help us mainly with things like end caps, event merchandise, a lot of the seasonal builds, both initial and end of season. And those are the ones that are going to get the greatest benefits. And talking with the team, we believe we will see a lot of those benefits in Q4 because the work we are doing right now is going to have that impact.", "Peter Keith", "Okay, thanks a lot guys. Good luck in the back half.", "Steve Barbarick", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs.", "Stephen Tanal", "Hey, good afternoon guys and congrats Tony. Good luck. So, the one thing I was trying to sort of understand on the weather, if we think about that $25 million pull forward into 1Q and sort of normalize for that, it\u2019s about 140 bps, I think to 2Q and you kind of add it in, pull it out of 1Q and it does actually look like the underlying rate slowed. Is that a fair way to think about it or do you think that doesn\u2019t really capture the entire seasonal effect? And if you could maybe just give us a number, an all-in number on the weather impact for 2Q. If you guys have something in your head, that would be pretty helpful, too?", "Greg Sandfort", "Stephen, I think what you are referring to is if you try to normalize, looking at the pull forward and you push that through and kind of work the numbers that I think what you are saying is did we see a bit of a slowdown in second quarter just in general from what we saw in first quarter in sales if we did that.", "Stephen Tanal", "Yes, X the weather, like the core kind of trend rate here.", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, with the slowdown that we did see was, again, in the big ticket categories. No question that was part of it, but we believe that, that was due to the fact that the weather just was not complementary for selling those kinds of products. Our customers, as you know buy very much to need. And so when we looked at that and we did some normalization of our own with the numbers. Those big ticket categories are riding lawnmowers, as Steve mentioned and a few other categories, UTVs now which were very robust a year ago at this time, did not anniversary themselves.", "Stephen Tanal", "Understood. But just to be clear, is the big ticket impact part of that $25 million or not?", "Greg Sandfort", "Some, but not...", "Tony Crudele", "It definitely is.", "Greg Sandfort", "Yes, yes.", "Tony Crudele", "We got off to a very strong rider season in March and so we clearly had anticipated that rolling through into Q2.", "Greg Sandfort", "But it didn\u2019t roll through.", "Tony Crudele", "But it didn\u2019t. And as we stated in the prepared remarks, big ticket was down 8% and in particular, after being very strong in the March timeframe. So, you can adjust the month, but still, the trend was very consistent to the overall trends, where April and May were softer than June.", "Stephen Tanal", "Okay, got it. And just lastly, as we think about kind of the weather, obviously, a big topic of everything that\u2019s happening, it\u2019s been hot, which I think is generally good, but it\u2019s also been dry. And I think in June, we typically like wetter weather. And to be honest, I am not sure what we root for in July. Does the dryness hurt you? Do you want it to be wetter in general or how should we think about weather just high level?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, for the most part, we do prefer wet because things will continue to grow and it\u2019s a continuation of spring. But when you look at the moisture generally throughout the springtime, we have good moisture throughout. So as we move into the summer, it shouldn\u2019t be a significant impact. Obviously, when you look at the drought map, tends to be a little bit in sort of the Southwest and the California area. But because there is too much rain in say the Texas area, the heat is good because it helps dries out a little bit sooner. But generally, we look for moisture. It will be a positive thing as we move through the year.", "Stephen Tanal", "Great. And just last one for me, if there is any update you could share on that \u2013 I am sorry the inbound freight issues with the Casa Grande, have you made some headway with the vendors or have you switched up vendors, how is that going?", "Steve Barbarick", "This is Steve. This is going to be an ongoing challenge for our merchant team and our sourcing team, to continue to bring new folks on. We have made some headway in that, but when you are talking about as many product categories as we carry and 70-plus percent of those go through our network. This is not a one and done kind of scenario. So we are making headway. We have got about another 20 or 30 vendors that we are looking at right now in terms to trying either resource or find secondary vendors out West to be able to reduce those stem miles.", "Stephen Tanal", "Got it. Thank you very much guys.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.", "Chris Bottiglieri", "This is Chris Bottiglieri on for Scott Mushkin. Our first question was, taking a step back, you guys have \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s a very strong track record, but it seems more recently, the annual comp algorithm has kind of slowed a bit. So one, kind of like putting weather aside in the last couple of quarters, but in the last couple of years, like why do you think this is happening. And then as a follow-up, like do you think that your current growth initiatives can lead to reaccelerated comp algorithm looking forward or are you kind of comfortable in this range?", "Greg Sandfort", "Chris, let me start with that. Tony will probably jump in. I have been with the company now \u2013 I will be 9 years in November. And I would say that the last 4 years had been the most interesting from a standpoint of the mix of our products, when things were selling, when things peaked, introductions of newness and so on. But I can\u2019t underestimate and we used to \u2013 I think things that we could control more things around some of the weather patterning across the country, but as we have gotten now into 49 states and that store dispersion is a good thing generally. I would tell you that it makes it more challenging for us to understand sometimes how these ebb and flows will affect the overall business on an annual basis. We typically can work our way through some of these slight, if you call it, troubled spots where we have, I will say, less than ideal weather and less than ideal conditions for selling certain products. But we are in a new learning curve here I believe, as we look at some of these things moving forward. And the team has done some great work as we forecast forward through the second half and into next year. And I am convinced that we can kind of push this thing back on this growth trajectory that is kind of expected from Tractor. I mean we are a test and learn company. We learn all the time. There is no lack of newness, as Steve mentioned earlier. We continue to introduce new products and those are things that really drive all the footsteps. And then we are getting far better at this localization component. And that\u2019s going to be a key as we go forward because that helps us defend ourselves when conditions are less than ideal for selling some products. I can\u2019t reiterate enough, our customers buy to demand or to need. They don\u2019t buy early, they haven\u2019t been for a long time.", "Tony Crudele", "And I will just add that over my 11 years here, we don\u2019t necessarily see what the next silver bullet is going to be, but being the test and learn, we are constantly coming up with really good ideas and products. And we let our customer dictate what the next best item is going to be. But when it comes to the model itself, generally our forecasting is always in the 3% to 5% range. We don\u2019t need to reach the high single-digit comps anymore to have a really successful year. And so as we look out, we think that the model will work just terrifically at the 3% to 5% comp level.", "Chris Bottiglieri", "Okay, great. You guys absolutely had strong track record didn\u2019t mean to take anything away from there. Just one brief follow-up about the C.U.E. strategy, how much do you think is left in that, like what inning do you think we are in, if you benchmark yourself to the industry, like talking to your suppliers, are you taking share there, like do you think your customers have adopted the premium brand in the space like kind of what\u2019s left there you think in the C.U.E. like the next, call it 3 years to 5 years?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. This is Steve. We still see more opportunity here and we have seen continued growth over the last several years. And it\u2019s really driving footsteps into our stores. Our focus is really around being priced right. It\u2019s about having the right inventories. And it\u2019s about expanding our assortments. And we have continued to do that very well. I still think that there is upside and a lot of momentum here that we still have. Depending upon the category you look at, I will use \u2013 if you benchmark maybe our overall pet business versus industry, I think if you looked at that, you would probably say we are outstripping and indexing higher than industry and therefore you would have to make the assumption that you are taking share. If you look at our feed business, I would tell you, based on what we hear from our suppliers, there is a good likelihood that we are taking market share there as well. And you could go across the four walls, whether it would be in lubricants, whether it would be in lawn and garden or other categories such as betting. And I think we continue to do a nice job, offering a great assortment that has the right in-stock at great value prices for our customers every day. So I still think that there is a more upside here.", "Chris Bottiglieri", "Okay, great. Thank you for your time. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "Good afternoon everybody. Best wishes to you Tony. Just a real quick question on the big ticket items in this most recent quarter, are there attached products that went missing because somebody wasn\u2019t buying an ATV say, a trailer or hitches, things like that, that took away from the total sales beyond just the big ticket merchandise?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. This is Steve. And that\u2019s a great question because when you talk seasonal, there is a lot of attachments that come with OPE. There is a lot of replacement parts and whatnot. And we saw a relative softness across many of those compared to a year prior\u2019s strong comp store sales there. So many of those attachments and accessories do carry a little higher margin that was a question asked earlier and we did see those sales be soft over the course of the second quarter.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "Alright. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer", "Greg, the way that these three measures new store productivity began to weaken a bit about a year ago I know that from your perspective, it really hasn\u2019t had much change, but based on the publicly available information, that\u2019s how the number shake out. And then a few quarters after that, we saw the weakness, the negative comps in the fourth quarter last year and now another negative quarter, if you have any concern from your part that perhaps some of the weaker new store openings could be a leading indicator of, call it, saturation and that could be contributing to this current sales trend?", "Greg Sandfort", "Dan, what I can tell you is the facts. No question, when we first opened the new Western markets, we saw some weakness there in a few markets and that drag for about 1 year and 18 months was there. But the process we use in finding and aligning new stores and how we plan for cannibalization in this, we are seeing a more normalization again. We are seeing stores performing back to that level. And on a year-over-year basis, the run rates are very similar. So we did have a little period of time there when it was, gee, what happened and we looked at it and it was really very concentrated in really the Utah market. So no, we are not seeing new store productivity sliding. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s as good today as it was a few years back. But we did have a little blip in there and I think we got to \u2013 we worked our way through that.", "Dan Wewer", "The second question I have revolves around Revionics and your pricing optimization, you have been very bullish about the benefit to gross margin rate, in light of the recent sales trends, have you taken a fresh look at elasticity of demand and perhaps come to the conclusion perhaps we squeeze about as much out of pricing as we can and in fact, maybe there is the case that we make for becoming more promotional, which sounds like you did during the quarter?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes, Dan, this is Steve. I mean, the pricing tools that we use in regular price are ongoing, and they give us recommendations based on demand by area of the country. So we are constantly looking and fine-tuning that, challenging it ourselves. And where we have upside, we take it up. And where we think we need to be more aggressive, we will move those prices down. So from that perspective, I think that there is still more we can get out of the tools. As a matter of fact, we just recently extended our contract with Revionics because we continue to see value there. In addition to that, the clearance module that we use has still been very effective for us and helping us work our way through a lot of that product while it\u2019s still in home before it gets moved and try to move it through while we\u2019re still in season. Our units in terms of SKU products, we\u2019re still seeing strong comp store units movement, and we really track units as much as we do sales in many cases. Now you\u2019ve heard the last couple of years, we have seen some deflation there, so we have got some headwinds to overcome. But generally speaking, I still think that there is some more opportunity for us in using that tool.", "Dan Wewer", "Okay. And just real quickly on the comments about July, we have known that the year-over-year comparison would be difficult for 12 months. In fact, as I recall, July of 2014 was a very strong month for Tractor Supply as well. So based on your comments about the first 2 weeks of July of 2016, are you saying they are weak, but that\u2019s exactly the way it was budgeted or is the company communicating \u2013 we knew it was going to be a tough comparison. Could you even take that input now, we are running below where we thought we would be?", "Tony Crudele", "Dan, this is Tony. Let me answer that one. What we are saying is that we did not see a shift of sales, spring sales from Q2 into Q3. And so we are not making a statement one way or the other relative to the performance to our expectations or comparison to comps of last year. I will say \u2013 and I would say I am in agreement with you. We have had three very strong Julys in a row. And obviously, when we look out and we forecast, we would forecast July not to be the strongest of the three months in the quarter.", "Dan Wewer", "So your cautiousness, this reflects the fact that you are not recovering the sales lost in April and May, but you are not necessarily saying that the current run-rate is below plan, it\u2019s just that you are not making up for the ground that was lost?", "Tony Crudele", "That\u2019s correct.", "Dan Wewer", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Yes, I will keep this one short given the timeframe here. Tony, you referenced earlier and you have said this in the past, what spring should be good for at 3Q trends since it does extend the growing season. Are you expecting any benefit from that \u2013 this, call it, third quarter or is something different this year?", "Tony Crudele", "No. As we stated, we had anticipated that with the moisture and with the slow start to the spring that it would be a delayed spring and would continue into Q3. But since we did not experience that bounce back in June, we were very cautious and did not anticipate extending out. So yes, it is a little bit different than what we\u2019ve seen in the past. But we did not expect any additional spring sales in the July, August timeframe.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "But haven\u2019t you discussed in the past that more moisture in the ground actually helps you kind of throughout the balance of 3Q or am I misunderstanding that?", "Tony Crudele", "No, I think that\u2019s correct. And again, as we saw throughout the quarter, with the softness in sales as well as the big ticket being soft as well as having the last sort of 3 years of strong Q3, in particular, strong July, August, it\u2019s just is a more difficult comparison.", "Scot Ciccarelli", "Okay, I will follow-up later. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam Sindler", "Yes, good morning. I am sorry, good afternoon everyone. Just to focus on margins for a couple of minutes here. As we look to the second half of the year, what are the major puts and takes in the gross margin line in the third and fourth quarters? Is it more the impact of inbound freights on C.U.E. on the West Coast, D.C., is it mix? Just as we think about how the weather plays out, what are the different things we should try and think about?", "Tony Crudele", "As we move into the back half of the year, they tend to be \u2013 the margins as well as most of the P&L tends to be a little bit more predictable. Now obviously, as we work our way through the quarter and sales and how we react to sales and continue to drive sales, obviously, we can have an impact. But really, as we look year-over-year, there is not any significant aberrations from last year that we are going to be comping. So I would say generally, relatively consistent. We look to see that in both quarters, we anticipate improving our gross margin, which will help us drive the EBIT margin improvement for the overall company and in the back half of the year.", "Adam Sindler", "So slightly higher gross margins both in the third and fourth quarters?", "Tony Crudele", "Correct.", "Adam Sindler", "Okay. And then on the expense line, I mean, so that is one thing that really sort of has changed quite a bit over the last 3 years, not only has sales, but a little bit as you pulled back your square footage and as you\u2019ve lost the very significant benefit of inflation that you had several years ago. But your SG&A is now running up closer to 10% a year versus maybe 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% a year, and then that\u2019s converged with sales. So obviously, there\u2019s a need to continue to invest in the business. But at the same time, sort of what is the thought process around what can be done perhaps to try and get a little bit of a greater spread between sales, dollar growth and SG&A dollar growth?", "Tony Crudele", "True. We continuously look at cost savings initiatives. And in actuality, we feel that we have been very successful. One, in managing headcount both at the store support center and in the stores and you can see that in Q2 in particular as we really managed the payroll expense and the variability relative to the softer sales. And we have some key initiatives looking at all levels of expense structure. So when you look at the increase, we believe that it really is very focused on growth areas and areas that we need to make investment in. And as I alluded to in our prepared remarks, as much as we only ran about a 6% increase year-over-year, net of the incentive compensation, we do expect as we continue to move forward to be in \u2013 somewhere in the 9% to 10% range, consistent with our growth in sales, in particular because some of the investments that we made last year that we are cycling in particular, the Arizona distribution center and the mixing center.", "Adam Sindler", "Alright. I guess longer-term though, they are never \u2013 at least as you stand right now, it\u2019s sort of just perpetuity investment mode, is that the way to think about it?", "Tony Crudele", "Yes. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say perpetuity, but as we continue to grow the chain at obviously a fairly significant clip of 110 to 120 stores, we are going to continue to invest in the infrastructure and that\u2019s where the majority of the dollars are going.", "Adam Sindler", "Okay, alright. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard", "Hi. Two things, first of all from a competitive standpoint, Greg I think you have mentioned localization and the opportunities there, I am just curious from a competitive standpoint, if you are seeing anything different, if you are seeing challenges or opportunities in that regard that you sort of look forward to pursuing?", "Greg Sandfort", "Eric, are you talking about \u2013 let me say competitive, you mean other farm store competitors in particular?", "Eric Bosshard", "You could say farm store or broaden it and say basically, where else your customers may acquire the product they get at your store?", "Greg Sandfort", "Yes. I would say to you that from a competitive standpoint, I think the overall farm community or farm business is probably fairly healthy from a retail standpoint. And we are opening stores in markets where the competition is at. Vice versa, they are opening a few in our markets. And we have plans and I will call it tactics to challenge that and offset that. So we are not seeing any real competitive intrusion to any great degree, anything different than we have seen in the past. One of the things we don\u2019t and will not do is go and try to buy sales for the short-term. Steve mentioned earlier that we are going to look at all the ways that we can be in front of our customer with our mix and the brand itself. But the more stores that we put out there in the landscape, the more often and more chances we have to win customers over. So I think our plans as we go forward are solid. I think our store expansion strategy is solid. And there is not a competitive intrusion that\u2019s causing any issues for us at this point.", "Eric Bosshard", "And then secondly, just to understand, from a big ticket standpoint obviously, dilutive to the second quarter comp, do you expect big ticket to run below the average comp in the third quarter as well?", "Tony Crudele", "That\u2019s obviously pretty difficult for us to project. Being the optimistic retailers, we want to take each one of our categories and drive a comp increase in each one of those categories. As we look at the back half, it tends to be less sensitive to big ticket. However, as we saw last December there, we do have some big ticket items. Our focus is going to be to continue to drive value. And as Greg has indicated, our core business has been very strong. So we are going to continue to emphasize in those key categories that will drive footsteps. And hopefully, as we get those customers into the store, we will be able to get them to create a bigger basket and drive the comp sales in the back half of the year.", "Eric Bosshard", "Great. And then just one last point, in terms of core categories being strong, which is great to hear, anything within the core categories that have slowed a little bit relative to where they were previously or is that sort of other than big ticket, everything else is running basically where it\u2019s been?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. Eric, this is Steve. I would tell you that the business continues to be pretty strong in a lot of those basic core businesses. I mean Tony I believe talked about it in his prepared remarks that we continue to see good growth in the animal side of our business across all species. And so I don\u2019t see a slowdown there whatsoever. I think we continue to invest in those businesses and our assortments, our prices and our in-stock and we are seeing the traction and the benefit of those investments.", "Eric Bosshard", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we do have a final question for Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.", "Seth Basham", "Thanks a lot and good evening.", "Greg Sandfort", "Good evening.", "Seth Basham", "With the business not bouncing back as much as it historically has in June and July with the high moisture levels and the late spring, is that bounce more limited in big ticket or in the core consumables part of the business?", "Greg Sandfort", "It clearly was not in the big ticket categories. And one of the things you need to understand about our business is that there is a cycle and timing to this. And when you get past a certain point \u2013 we know our customer and they will say to us, it\u2019s too late in the season now to buy that x product. I will wait now until next year. And we have heard that in a number of instances as we have been out in the stores ourselves, so that really is the culprit right there.", "Seth Basham", "Got it. And as you assess the move into selling more kayaks and more UTVs based on what you experienced this season, is it something that you continue to expect to repeat next year or if you change the merchandising plan around those types of outdoor rec categories?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. This is Steve. Well, we had a challenging overall top line. I would tell you that there were a lot of gems in the quarter. We talked about a lot of what we did with gardening, in organics, sustainability. We saw a lot of growth there. We saw a lot of growth in our Chick Days event and a lot of what we are doing there as well. When it comes to what we are doing with our outdoor rec, we saw nice growth. Our kayak business really drove a lot of incremental units and top line sales there. So there is a lot of things in the box that are working incredibly well and I know that gets overshadowed by the overall top line sales for the quarter. But I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t say a lot of that as well as our core business being strong and the foot traffic coming in for those categories. So again overall, when you look at the quarter, it was a miss. And I think we are all disappointed by that, but at the same time we can build on those things that really worked this year for next year. And those categories that suffered this year a little bit, we will have a plan to reconcile.", "Seth Basham", "Thanks a lot and good luck.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And Mr. Sandfort there are no further questions, I will turn the call back to you for any closing remarks.", "Greg Sandfort", "Okay. Well, thank you, all for your continued support and your interest in Tractor Supply. And we look forward to speaking to you again in October regarding our third quarter performance.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Greg, please go ahead.", "Greg Sandfort", "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Kurt Barton, our Senior VP and Controller.", "As we previously discussed in our business update earlier in September, there were several headwinds affecting our business during the third quarter. We have dedicated a considerable amount of time and effort gathering and analyzing data during the quarter to understand more fully the impact these headwinds have had on our performance, and we do not believe the current sales trends are the result of significant shifts in the competitive landscape, our market share growth or our long-term operating fundamentals.", "In fact, our core everyday business in categories such as livestock and pet remained strong throughout the third quarter and our business outside of the energy and agricultural markets in regions like the Southwest and West performed very well for the quarter.", "We did however experience softer demand in the energy and agricultural markets and we saw a slow start to the early pre-season sales of cold weather and heating related products that impacted the Northern region.", "We have managed successfully through challenging sales environments before. The recession of 2008, 2009, and during those most difficult sales periods, our teams remained focused on managing the factors they could control, such as inventory, gross margin, and other expenses.", "We made the necessary adjustments then by taking a long-term, balanced approach as we cycled through those periods, and we will do the same for now until these short-term headwinds subside.", "At Tractor Supply, we are committed to introduce new products and updating the merchandising categories to keep our stores fresh and with the current sales environment we are specifically targeting those categories that have demonstrated strong sales performance year-to-date.", "Already this fall season we have had several series of calls with field leadership across several of our more challenged markets to understand the depth of the issues we face. As a result of those calls, we executed a number of timely inventory investments to ensure that we have the appropriate emphasis on categories of high demand in those regions that are performing well, categories such as pet food, agricultural fencing, and grass seed, to name a few.", "Additionally, recognizing that cold weather and winter preparedness sales were slower to ramp, we adjusted our inventories downward on cold weather products and upward on warm weather regional categories where customer demand stayed high, such as fly control, riding lawn mowers, short-sleeve shirts and packaged seeds.", "Having this agility to react to current sales trends, we believe is a level of sophistication and capability that differentiates us from most of our competition. Now, with respect to our management of seasonal inventory, we are monitoring sales trends closely and continue to adjust for ongoing customer demand.", "For example, in the heating category, which I mentioned earlier, we have experienced sluggish early demand and we have kept inventories at a minimum for now. When sales trends accelerate due to cooler weather, our supply chain and our vendor base are ready to react and we'll push inventory into our DCs, then into our stores quickly, so that we can meet the increased sales demands. Also in many of our everyday basic items queue, we have elevated in-stock levels to meet the continuing strong demand for animal, pet and land care needs.", "While we may be a chain of 1,500 plus stores, what is important to understand about our customer is that they perceive Tractor Supply as their unique farm store, conveniently located in their small community that offers them locally correct assortments that meet the unique outdoor lifestyle needs they have.", "Now on the marketing front, we adjusted Q3 and forward programs based on current sales trends by region in an effort to accelerate our comp store sales. We added radio advertising to promote key events during the quarter, such as our annual Pet Appreciation Week and lowest prices of the season event.", "We enhanced our digital impressions to our web customers and increased our circular distribution to a larger base of our best customers. And we added several targeted sales driving initiatives in key sales weeks to improve our overall sales and marketing effectiveness.", "To demonstrate how we are focusing on the growth of our business for the long-term, we are continuing to invest in technology to improve our capture of customer insights. This includes the rollout of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program which we believe will give Tractor Supply a unique way to communicate with our customer base by offering a more relevant and personalized message.", "As well, we completed bringing our customer database in house, so that we could better analyze and segment the customer information that we are collecting from our Neighbor Club members.", "We added an additional 45 stores to the Neighbor's Club program on October the 1st in the Western region and with the initial customer enrollment and customer response being so positive we now plan to roll the program out to all stores by the middle of 2017.", "We continue to invest in the platforms where our customers choose to shop, giving them more options in the way they can interact with the Tractor Supply Company as a brand. This includes the introduction of Buy Online Pickup in Store, which we started piloting in September and expect to have live in over half of the chain by the end of this year.", "We are also continuing to invest in our Tractor Supply website to improve search capabilities and to enhance the know-how section for product content and projects that are important to our customers, using videos and online articles. And we continue to invest in store level resources including mobile POS, and a more intuitive special order process that will assist our team members and our customers to locate hard to find products.", "As a company, we remain confident in our long-term store target of 2500 domestic Tractor Supply locations and mid single digit annual square footage growth. To help achieve this target, we recently conducted a comprehensive study of our logistics infrastructure to understand what would be required to add capacity and drive more supply chain efficiency as we move toward our long-term store target.", "One thing to note from the study data, we confirmed that we have a short term need to add additional distribution capacity in the Northeast region if we plan to continue the store growth there. We have begun the planning process to enable the opening of a new distribution center in that region targeted for mid to late 2018.", "Our recently announced purchase of Petsense, a leading specialty retailer of pet supplies and services with over 130 stores in 25 states is another example of our commitment to long-term growth.", "For some time now, we have discussed the pet category as a growth opportunity for the company and based on our research and experience with our own hometown pet concept, we concluded there is a substantial opportunity to grow the pet specialty business in small town America.", "Their expertise and success in growing a smaller pet specialty store format will allow Petsense to continue at a growth rate of 15% to 20% annually without distraction to the TSC business.", "Tractor Supply's proven expertise in site selection and store growth should make for a strong partnership with Petsense and allows us to accelerate their growth over time.", "Over the longer term, we stay focused on our people and their development. On enhancing our merchandise assortments and adding IT capability to better meet the evolving needs of our customers, while always being mindful to return value to our shareholders through sustainable longer term growth.", "Before I wrap up, I want to thank the nearly 23,000 members of the Tractor Supply family for their continued hard work, dedication and the level of service they provide our customers, a big goo-rah [ph] to all.", "I would also like to welcome the Petsense team as members of the Tractor Supply family. We are proud to be partnered with you and are excited about the opportunity to develop and grow the Petsense business.", "I will now turn the call over to Tony for more detailed commentary on our third quarter financial results and the outlook for the remainder of 2016.", "Tony Crudele", "Great. Thanks, Greg. And good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 24, 2016 on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased 4.5% to $1.54 billion. Net income grew 2.4% to $89.4 million, and EPS increased 4.7% to $0.67 per diluted share.", "Comp store sales decreased 0.6% in the third quarter compared to an increase of 2.9% in last year\u2019s third quarter. There are a number of economic headwinds impacting consumer spending throughout many of our markets. However, as noted in our business update on September 7, the energy producing and agricultural markets were the most impacted.", "To give you a sense of the magnitude of the macro impact of the energy and farm economies, we estimate that approximately 25% of our stores have a direct correlation to these economies. This does not include any of the stores that may be tangentially affected by the economies.", "The strongest regional performance was in the Southeast and West regions where there is less exposure to the energy and agricultural markets. The West region base had a solid mid single-digit comp, and the Southeast was well above chain average.", "We continue to experience strong demand from many of our basic everyday items, such as livestock and pet category, which generated mid single digit comparable chain wide sales. While the quarter did not shape up the way we expected, we continue to be well positioned for the long term. The solid comp sales in the non-impacted regions support our position that the business will continue to drive profitable growth.", "As Greg said, we have been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to customers, stakeholders and shareholders.", "Comp transaction count increased for the 34 consecutive quarter, gaining 0.5% on top of a 3.8% increase last year, as some queue items such as pet food and animal feed continue to drive strong traffic. Average comp ticket decreased by 111 basis points compared to last year\u2019s 90 basis point decrease.", "Big ticket was one of the largest drivers of this year's average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items declined approximately 4.7%. The decline was across several categories related principally to the energy and farm markets, as well as early season winter sales in the north.", "More discretionary items such as UTVs were down in the oil and farm areas. Oil patch related products such as compressors and fuel handling were down. Cold weather related hard lines such as log splitters and stoves were down double-digits, as a result of the lack of urgency, cycling a warm winter season last year and low heating oil prices.", "On a positive note, we did take advantage of opportunities for some key summer big ticket products, such as riding lawn mowers by working collaboratively with vendors to develop a late season sales driving program.", "Additionally, the average ticket was negatively impacted by the decline in the units per transaction with pre-season sales of wood burning fuel as the principal driver. We estimated that deflation also decreased the average ticket by approximately 40 basis points. September was the strongest sales month and did register a positive comp, September did have the easiest year-over-year comparison.", "Now turning to gross margin, which was flat at 34.7% compared to 60 basis point decrease in last year's third quarter. Overall, we are very pleased how the team managed margin during a tough selling environment. We continue to improve our initial margin through our key margin initiatives.", "Product mix had a negative impact on margin. This resulted from a larger mix of feed and pet food and the strong sales in the riding lawn mower category. With respect to margin rate, we were sharper on price, and as Greg mentioned, added few sales driving initiatives.", "Freight was essentially flat, lower diesel fuel, lower container costs and a reduction in outbound stem miles were favorable factors. This was offset by higher inbound and outbound costs related to mix and higher lane costs. We estimate that deflation had a slightly favorable impact on gross margin.", "For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization as a percent of sales deleveraged by 20 basis points to 25.5% of sales. The deleverage was primarily due to the decline in comparable sales.", "SG&A expense grew only 5.4% from the prior year, which benefited from a reduction in incentive compensation expense. Excluding incentive compensation, SG&A expense increased only 7.9%, a continuation of the tight cost control management initiated in the second quarter.", "Similar to the second quarter, we experienced strong cost control in store level and store support center payroll and medical expense. Occupancy expense was well managed as we continued to benefit from our LED lighting retrofit.", "The strong expense management was achieved against a headwind from our Arizona DC and mixing centers. We estimate the deleverage from these centers operations were approximately 15 basis points.", "Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36.5% in Q3 compared to 36.9% last year, due to additional federal and state tax credits.", "Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of Q3 this year we had a cash balance of $55.5 million and $295 million in outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $51.4 million and a $190 million outstanding debt last year.", "During the third quarter under our stock repurchase program we acquired approximately 1.4 million shares for $108.8 million. Average inventory levels per store decreased 1.8% compared to 1.6% increase in last year's third quarter and inventory turns decreased slightly. We managed our inventory well in the quarter and are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into the fourth quarter.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66.2 million compared to $66.5 million last year. We opened up 34 stores, closed one Del stores in the third quarter compared to 30 new stores opened and two Del stores and one Tractor Supply store closed in the third quarter of 2015.", "The CapEx this year relates to new store expansion which includes an emphasis on retrofit locations that generally require renovation capital and our LED lighting retrofit project, whereas last year capital included $12.6 million for the Arizona DC.", "Now looking ahead, based on the trends and results of the third quarter we revised our outlook for the full year - fiscal year 2016 in our September 7th business update. We are reiterating that outlook today.", "We expect full year sales to range from $6.7 billion to $6.75 billion, comparable store sales to increase between 1% and 1.7%, and net income to range from $432 million to $438 million and earnings per diluted share to range between $3.22 to $3.26.", "Assumed in this full year guidance is an EBIT margin decline of 10 to 15 basis points, a tax rate of 36.7%, and capital expenditures of $235 million to $245 million.", "We will continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program and currently project full year diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $133.8 million to $134.2 million.", "As a reminder, we have our 53rd week and an additional comp sales day in the fourth quarter. We now estimate that the additional week will provide $0.04 to $0.05 benefit to EPS which is contained in our guidance. We expect deflation in the fourth quarter of approximately 40 basis points.", "With respect to gross margin, we expect to continue to be sharp on price, which will limit the upside on margin. We also expect to have slight headwinds from product mix and transportation expenses as we cycle the decline in diesel prices. Therefore, we are targeting gross margin to be flat to slightly down for the full year and the fourth quarter.", "With respect to SG&A, we will continue to drive cost saving programs in the fourth quarter and we will react accordingly to the sales trends. We expect to maintain appropriate payroll allocation to drive sales in the fourth quarter, and incur a more normalized incentive compensation expense.", "We will continue to have the headwind of the Arizona DC until we cycle its opening in late December. Although we benefit from slight leverage from the additional sales week, it has very little impact on the quarter. We estimate that the additional week adds approximately 6% to the year-over-year SG&A growth including depreciation. We do not expect to leverage SG&A for the quarter.", "With respect to Petsense acquisition, as we mentioned in our webcast call on September 29th, we expect one time transaction costs with the majority being recognized in the fourth quarter to be approximately $0.01 to $0.015.", "There will be some integration costs, but we expect these to be immaterial to our overall financial results. Although not originally included in our full year outlook due do the immaterial or the amount, we did not revise our guidance. Our guidance does not include Petsense sales or operations as we expect the net bottom line impact not to be material.", "As a few reminders, as we look ahead to 2017, we'll be cycling the 53rd week year and therefore you need to adjust your models accordingly. With the resulting one-week shift in 2017, Q2 will have one less comp day related to the shift in Easter.", "Additionally in 2016, we had a significant decrease in incentive compensation. We would expect a normalized planned incentive compensation for 2017 and that would represent an incremental $0.07 to $0.08 to the SG&A cost structure.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And once again, I remind you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And we will take our first question from Matt McClintock from Barclays.", "Matt McClintock", "Hi, yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering if you could maybe update us on the competitive dynamics that you are seeing in some of those challenged energy markets and rural markets, are you seeing anything different there?", "And then, longer term, if weakness persists, I mean, could we actually argue an acceleration in market share consolidation for those markets? Thanks.", "Greg Sandfort", "Matt, hi. This is Greg Sanford. We are not seeing anything of any substance from a competitive standpoint in even those markets that you mentioned that are challenged right now. The farm store market still has growth and some of the competition are opening some stores. But we are outpacing their growth at a very, very high rate.", "So, to think there is a competitive threat, I would say no, from another farm store competitor. And that\u2019s what \u2013 we watch that very closely and monitor, but I would say, no, there is not.", "Matt McClintock", "And then if I could ask a follow-up, you reiterated the 2,500 store goal longer term. And if I recall, I believe there might have even been longer term some upside there previously in the past. As I think about that goal, does that imply a recovery in those energy markets to maybe the highs or any recovery at all in those markets? How do we \u2013 how should we think about that?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, first of all, the modeling that we use would not today say don\u2019t go into those markets because right now they are under some pressure. It would actually tell us that there is a placeholder there for a store based upon all the factors that go into that model, and there is a number of those. And so it would tell us that that\u2019s an ideal location.", "The one thing I can tell you is that in some of those markets where we\u2019re seeing some challenges today, we are being very diligent when those stores come up for presentation, a real estate strategy. We need to look at them very closely to make sure that they are stores that we believe now today we should be looking toward opening.", "Now, there is a number of stores already in the pipeline for 2017, and those stores we are going to stay with and run with. We\u2019re talking about stores now that truly are affecting '18 and probably into '19.", "Matt McClintock", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.", "Peter Benedict", "Hi, guys. Just a question on the Neighbors Club and the decision to kind of roll that out for next year. I mean, what kind of impacts are you seeing from it? Can you give us a little bit more color on what has encouraged you and given you the confidence to push this out by the middle of next year?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. Peter, this is Steve Barbarick. We started the program back, it was about a year ago in October, and we've been very methodical in watching it. The one thing that's really exciting is the enrollment continues to exceed our expectations.", "To look at the fact that - I'll give you some numbers here, 80% of the e-mails that we're getting through the program are new to our database and about 50% of the folks that are signing up are also new to our database. So we're getting a real good insight into these individuals.", "And tracking over the course of the last year, what we're finding is the people that are signing up, and this is of no surprise, tend to be the closest ones to the brand and they do want to hear from us. They tend to shop us more often and they are twice as likely to take advantage of our marketing promotions.", "So as we move forward with this program, we think that this is a real opportunity to talk more to them. They are typically our best customers and they really want to hear from us. So we think this has a lot of upside in the future.", "Peter Benedict", "And related to that, Steve, the response to the marketing changes you guys made in the fourth quarter, just curious, I mean, what's the plan for the fourth quarter, which of those events or radio or what was the most impactful in your view and how do you guys plan to kind of evolve the marketing in 4Q and then into '17 based on that?", "Steve Barbarick", "You know, lot of what we're doing is not just new, but it's also enhancements of what we're currently doing. So for example, we're using the digital space today more effectively than we've had in the past.", "And so you'll see us continue to move down that path as we evolve. We still know that a lot of our customers like the traditional marketing that we do. But we will continue to evolve based on what we see it to be most efficient and that's where right now we're kind of moving toward.", "Peter Benedict", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next, we have Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse.", "Seth Sigman", "Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I wanted to just follow up on a comment about September improving. I think the comment was that September was positive. Can you elaborate on that?", "And I know you said there was an easy comp, but did you see any sort of narrowing of the gap between some of those troubled markets versus the healthier markets? Thanks.", "Tony Crudele", "Sure, Seth. This is Tony. As I mentioned on the remarks, it was an easier comparison, but as we looked at the individual markets, we did see that those markets were still the ones that had the similar trends that we had in the July and August time frame.", "The one thing in September that did impact September was obviously not getting any type of cold snaps and some of the pre-season heating sales were still down. But again, going up against the easier compare of last year made September a positive comp.", "Seth Sigman", "Okay. And so just to clarify, when you talk about the 25% of the store base, that's either in energy markets or agricultural markets, you are not referring to those stores necessarily getting better in September?", "Tony Crudele", "Yes. When we look at those stores, those are clearly \u2013 I want to say its all ships rise with the current tide. So as we moved into September, obviously, we had stronger comps, but the difference or the delta between sort of a normalized comp and those stores remains similar as it was in July and August.", "Seth Sigman", "Okay. Got it. And then, on the expense side, obviously very well managed this quarter despite the tough environment. How are you thinking about the ability to leverage comps here?", "I mean, you gave some color on the fourth quarter, but just in general as we look out over the next 12 months, to the extent that comps are maybe below that 3% to 5% long-term target, maybe what are some of the opportunities that the team is focused on to maybe take some expenses out?", "Tony Crudele", "Sure. We've been very aggressive in looking at the expenses for the back half, as we saw sales soften through Q2 and Q3. As we look out, we believe that we can continue to manage those discretionary expenses, such as travel, training, looking at some of the stores, really working with vendor to try to reduce our costs relative to maintenance, supplies, and fixtures and things like that. So obviously, we'll continue to do that.", "The one thing that's very important to us though is, we look at the long-term and so we do not want to do anything that would jeopardize the business. So we'll continue to make sure that we fund our stores, fund payroll. We want to make sure that we maintain market share and we want to convert those customers and maintain those customers as they come into our store.", "The one thing that we do mention when we look out over the next 12 months is the incentive compensation piece. Though, obviously it's much reduced this year and we'll be comping up against that as we put in a more normalized incentive compensation, it will make it very difficult to get SG&A leverage.", "Seth Sigman", "Okay. Understood. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers", "Thanks. Good evening. So to follow up on that, I mean, I know, you haven't given full guidance for 2017, you have a long-term earnings algorithm out there of 3% to 5% comps and mid-teens earnings growth. And given the state of the world it feels like that's not going to be achievable next year.", "So any initial thoughts about how you're thinking about the sales outlook for next year and the overall earnings growth would be really helpful?", "Greg Sandfort", "Sure. As we look out, we're still very confident in the long-term store target of the 2500. And we tend - we still want to look out and we believe that we are capable of driving that 3% to 5% comp on a long-term basis.", "Obviously, as we look at the headwinds that have been presented to us this year, as well as we cannot determine at what point in time they will subside. We will take a harder look at the short term and adjust our comps accordingly.", "At this point in time though, we're not prepared to give full guidance on 2017. But obviously given the current sales environment, we would agree with the consensus that it would be difficult to hit the longer term target of 3% to 5%.", "Christopher Horvers", "Understood. And just related to that, so then is the message here guys, look we've got $0.05, $0.06 for the 53rd week. You've got $0.07 to $0.08 from the incentive comp normalizing.", "So if consensus is like 360, is it essentially the message just to take those one-time items and reduce our numbers by that amount to bring it down to that 345 to 350-ish level?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, obviously, we want you to consider those factors in the model. We are a grower, we're going to continue to grow the store base next year. We anticipate to be above the 100 store range next year. And we - the merchandising team is aggressive as far as putting in programs and looking at new products and trying to drive the comps. So obviously, we're really working hard to have a very strong 2017 campaign.", "Having said that, we just understand that those headwinds of the 53rd week and the incentive compensation will have an impact on earnings. But again, our mind set here is we want to be double-digit earnings growth, and we\u2019re going to do whatever we can to make sure that happens.", "Christopher Horvers", "Understood. And then, just as a follow up, how much of your mix would you say is heating related in the fourth quarter? And then, you know, bigger picture, how much is cold weather related sales as a percentage of mix in fourth quarter as well? Thank you.", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. Christopher, this is Steve Barbarick. And we typically don\u2019t get too detailed into the numbers. The big picture, we know that animal products is about 40% to 45% of our business, and seasonally it changes. So, again, we\u2019re not going to get that granular here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS.", "Michael Lasser", "Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It\u2019s on the 25% of the business that\u2019s been underperforming. Did it seem to catch you off-guard that the ag markets are rolling over?", "So what are you looking for to give you an indication that it\u2019s going to get better? I guess, the point is how long is this going to be a drag on the overall business?", "Tony Crudele", "Well, obviously, Michael, it\u2019s very difficult to project how long that would be. Now, what I would tell you, as far as order of magnitude, the oil markets have been a drag. Obviously, just in the recent weeks you start to see the oil prices coming back. They are having a few more rigs put back into place. Not that that\u2019s going to turn of on a light switch, but obviously it\u2019s more of a positive indication.", "Next, on the higher key would be really the impact of the cold weather products, and that would be probably the second biggest drag on the comps. And then really, thirdly, it\u2019s the farm economy. And it\u2019s really all three combined, which is having the impact.", "So as any one of those start to turn, you know, obviously, it would have a favorable impact on the business. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say we need all three of them to turn around to start to see the comps really improve dramatically, and of those three factors, farm income probably is the least of the three.", "Michael Lasser", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Tony. Two points to clarify. You mentioned double-digit earnings growth for next year, are you saying think about double-digit earnings growth and then subtract the incentive comp piece and the extra week piece or is that not the right way to think about it?", "Tony Crudele", "I would say that would be the correct way to look at it. I would say you want to adjust for those items and then this team here is - we are geared towards driving double-digit growth, but we need to adjust for those two factors.", "Michael Lasser", "And then will there be - how should we think about the sales contribution from Petsense in the fourth quarter?", "Tony Crudele", "We're not providing guidance at this time. What we believe is that any bottom line benefit that we would receive would offset the transaction and or integration cost in that quarter. So net-net, bottom line, there is not an impact.", "Michael Lasser", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.", "Peter Keith", "Hey, thanks for taking the question, guys. Just to circle back on the oil markets, and maybe a little bit on the ag economies too with the economic issues. When you look at the oil markets it's 25% of the base, is that only South Central Texas or could you maybe frame that up for us geographically and then similarly on the - where the ag economies are the worst?", "Tony Crudele", "This is Tony. I'll give you just a little bit more color as best as I can. In the prepared remarks we talked about 25% of the store base and that would include all energy, which would be oil, it could also be coal in the Appalachian area and obviously the farming tends to be mostly in the Midwest and the Great Plains.", "So - but what we're saying is \u2013 and this is such a broad area of the country. All the stores are getting thrown in there. So it appears to be a much larger piece of business. But when we run our models, we see that the co-relation specifically to all three of those being any of the oil, energy, coal or farm, the co-relation, the direct correlation is only for about 25% of the store base. So those are the ones that are being directly impacted. So, as much as we have a lot of stores in Texas, there is only X amount that are energy impacted.", "So the first thing is I would not extrapolate it to every store in every state, what we're saying is about 25% of the stores are co-relate directly and have a more significant impact than the rest of the chain.", "Peter Keith", "Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And wanted to pivot over to gross margin, curious on the sharper pricing, it sounds like you're having some success there. Is that something that with ongoing sluggishness you would anticipate continuing and is there a possibility to get some vendor support to perhaps mitigate the gross margin impact?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. This is Steve Barbarick. We have been working with our supplier community. But we use a price optimization tool in systems here and it's been very effective for us. And we continue to drive share in a lot of the key categories that are more price sensitive, like feed and in some cases pet food.", "I don't want to get too deep into the vendor support, but we do work with our vendors to make sure that when we do promote and we do EDLP pricing that we're competitive and that we are continuing to gain share.", "Peter Keith", "Okay. And maybe just a follow-up on that for Tony, is there some risk of gross margin pressure continuing in a sluggish sales environment or just too tough to tell at this point looking out to next year?", "Tony Crudele", "Obviously, it's too early to tell for next year. As we've done our sensitivities for Q4, we believe that if there is margin pressure with some of the pricing programs we would expect to pick it up on the top line and vice versa, if we aren't overly aggressive on price we'll pick it up on the margin side relative to the models that we ran for the quarter.", "Peter Keith", "Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate it.", "Greg Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.", "Steven Forbes", "Good afternoon.", "Greg Sandfort", "Hi, Steven.", "Steven Forbes", "To start with the top line performance and trends within the different sales categories thus far, so far this year, I know you mentioned live stock and pet rose mid single digits during the quarter, I think that's been relatively consistent.", "But can you provide some color around the other categories, maybe just touching on the categories you lay out within the SEC filings and how they've trended throughout the year just to give us a better perspective as we look out, kind of over the next 6 to 12 months here as relates to the compares by category?", "Steve Barbarick", "Steven, this is Steve. And I'll try to stay at a fairly high level here, because we can break this thing down in a lot of little pieces and parts. But we talked about the impact that the energy markets have had on ticket. And I would go back and say that categories such as welders, some compressors, those type of businesses have been a bit of a challenge for us.", "And you can see that in those individual markets where we are impacted most by energy, things like certain apparel, whether it's some steel footwear \u2013 toe footwear or fire retardant apparel, you can actually look into those specific regions and you can pretty much, you know, kind of, estimate what categories are going to be the most impacted there.", "In terms of the seasonal businesses, we talked about having a fairly soft spring, but then it drug into the fall and that benefited us. But we certainly didn't capture any of the pre-heating sales that we had traditionally gotten.", "So again, if you look at seasonal, it's kind of a tale of two stories. We prefer to have spring in spring and winter in winter, but that just hasn't necessarily been the case yet. So we're having to move some of our inventories around to better position ourselves to optimize where we think we can.", "And then the last thing I would tell you is in the truck, tool and hardware business, it's a little similar to what I talked about earlier with some of the big ticket. Truck boxes, fuel handling, those kind of categories have been really soft for us, and again, we believe a lot of that is more energy related. So does that help clarify some?", "Steven Forbes", "Yes, I guess. And then I guess as a follow-up, maybe if we can expand on it regarding the trends in those more discretionary categories, right, the non-maintenance side and not livestock and pet. I mean, I guess just trying to understand the color around of behavioral trends, right, as you think about the consumer shopping the store.", "I'm not sure if you have visibility via talking to store managers or so forth. Is it \u2013 are the consumers coming into the box, right, because you're clearly driving traffic, the 34th consecutive quarter and are they shopping the rest of the store and just not making \u2013 exploring the side of the store, exploring the merchandising displays and just not making the purchase or are you seeing the consumers come into the store and really just go right for that back section livestock and pet and not even exploring everything you are doing on the merchandising side?", "And then how does that relate, right to the initiatives you have in place and you are working on, as it relates to space allocation merchandising and promotional activity, right, as you look to curtail those trends?", "Greg Sandfort", "Steven, this is Greg. Let me -I'll make it very simple for you. There is evidence not only in the consumer surveys that we've completed, but in our current sales trends that the customers have become more conservative in their purchasing behaviors. It doesn't mean they are not still buying, but they're buying more conservative, which means they are buying absolutely what they need at the time that they need it.", "They are still shopping the store as evidenced by the transaction increases that we're seeing. They are still supporting the pet, the animal and some land maintenance and in other categories across the store.", "So we're not seeing them just cherry pick. They are actually shopping across the store, but they've pulled back considerably on big ticket spends for now. We think there is a number of factors involved there, not just the energy markets and some of the things happening in the ag economy.", "But we\u2019re going to get to listen again this evening a debate about who is going to be the next President of the United States, and those things have some effect on our customer, no question.", "We have heard from them in these surveys that they feel their budgets are a bit tighter right now. And as we\u2019ve been monitoring sales trends and looking at this by region, the customer demand for those things that are needed to support the lifestyle continue to exist, they continue to come in and purchase in our stores.", "So we have got to keep bringing new products. We\u2019ve got to keep updating the merchandise assortment, keeping those stores fresh and I can tell you the consumer count is still there, but they are being very conservative and very thoughtful in their spends.", "Steven Forbes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.", "Simeon Gutman", "Thanks. Good afternoon. So I want to ask about farm income, because a couple years ago it actually started to nosedive, and we know from history there was no impact to the business. And actually the deceleration was sharper two or three years ago than any time in 2016.", "So I\u2019m trying to figure out what\u2019s happening now, why it wasn\u2019t evident before, if something else was sort of hiding the impact, because I think what we\u2019re all trying to get at is it\u2019s hard to quantify, we don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to end. But because you weren\u2019t getting hit by it before, how do we understand the downside? And I\u2019m sure you are trying to figure out the same thing, how are you thinking about it?", "Greg Sandfort", "Simeon, this is Greg. This - when we studied that in years past and up till even this point in time, this is the first time in a number of years that back to back to back years the farm community has suffered losses in the crops that they\u2019ve tried to bring in and sell.", "There is also a factor in cattle, which most people don\u2019t think about, but in the state of Texas and in the few states north of that it\u2019s a big impact as well, cattle prices, a dollar less per pound.", "I mean, we hear these things from our customers, and I would tell you that I think it\u2019s more severe now than it was in the past. I\u2019ll also tell you that in the model of our business, this is the first time that we\u2019ve seen energy come into the same kind of a play on top of these other aspects.", "So multiple things working at the same time, it\u2019s not \u2013 the farm piece we just mentioned this time and said it's more of a factor or at least it's a bit of an overhang because it's the first time in a number of years we can actually say in those communities we're seeing a softness, we didn't see that before. But it's other factors on top of those factors we believe that have caused the drag.", "Simeon Gutman", "So just to following \u2013 I guess clarifying that, not my follow-up yet, but would you say, I guess, there's been a lag or you are saying there's somewhat of a coincidence now just because it's just amplifying some of the other pressures?", "Greg Sandfort", "I think you just answered your own question.", "Simeon Gutman", "Okay. And then my second question, you know, it sounds like you're stepping up the marketing to help drive the sales. What about any I guess temptation to promote during this environment, Greg, is there any or Steve, I mean, or doesn\u2019t make sense - does not make sense for your business?", "Greg Sandfort", "Simeon, here's how it works, when there's no demand for certain categories of products, there is not a price that you can sell that product to the consumer for. And I'm talking about things like heating, I'm talking about things like possibly large farm equipment or larger pieces of equipment, big ticket items and so on.", "You have to have the consumer demand. Now we're going to need to be a little patient here and understand that we can maneuver and control inventories in some of those categories where the demand's not great right now, but we want to make sure and Steve would tell you this, that we have the ability to react if the category starts to accelerate.", "We believe there will still be a heating business this year, but we think it's going to come later. We do believe there will be some outerwear business and some call it seasonal type businesses this year. But until we see some weather improvement, meaning cooler weather, that's not going to transpire.", "So instead, inventories have been shifted a bit and where we put our \u2013 and placed our bets is on the things within queue and the categories that are retailing right now and doing well.", "But we have every ability to react when things would move in the right direction and we believe it will come. We don't know the timing of it, but we do believe some of these seasonal trends will shift.", "Simeon Gutman", "Okay. Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc.", "Ben Bienvenu", "Yes. Thanks, good afternoon. Tony, I think in the past you had quantified the differential between your energy exposed markets and the rest of the chain to be around 400 to 500 basis points.", "Is that still the case today in light of sort of the broadening of the store base that's seen weakness and the broadening of the SKU set that's seen weakness?", "Tony Crudele", "Yes, Ben, you're correct, it has - the difference has continued. It's been very consistent over the last three quarters. But where we're disappointed is that, as we had mentioned on a previous conference call, we were hoping that that differential would moderate as we came into the back half of the year and we have not seen that happen.", "So there still is a relatively large delta and again, until the economies really start to turn a little bit, we expect that we'll have similar delta throughout the end of the year.", "Ben Bienvenu", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, when you look at the ag exposed markets, is it a similar magnitude of differential or is it less or more? Any quantification you could provide there would be helpful.", "Tony Crudele", "Sure. The differential is a little bit less and it's very, very less number of stores as well.", "Ben Bienvenu", "Okay, great. Thanks. Best of luck.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alan Rifkin with BTIG.", "Alan Rifkin", "Thank you much. Thank you. Just to follow up on a couple of earlier questions. So you've cited agricultural impacts, as well as energy as two of the three reasons. So can you just try to help us delineate the impact between just those two variables on the business?", "Greg Sandfort", "I'm sorry, which two, the ag\u2026", "Alan Rifkin", "Agriculture and energy. Now I understand the impact from both of them, but are you able to segregate the effect of agriculture alone on the business versus energy alone?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, at times it's very difficult to segregate the two because you may have some that cross both. But I would try to give you a generalization of the magnitude is probably at least three to one when it comes to the impact of oil on the comps versus farm on the comps.", "Alan Rifkin", "Okay. Thank you. And my follow-up, you are now talking about 113 stores for this year, whereas last quarter you were talking about 115 to 120. When you take that together with your earlier statement, Tony, that next year you are going to open up \u201cabove 100 store range\u201d.", "Should we think of your square footage in 2017 really being closer to 6% rather than the 7%, 7.5% versus what some people thought, and why the slippage of anywhere from 2 to 7 stores for this year? Thank you.", "Tony Crudele", "We're currently assessing the store target for next year. I would tell you that we have the majority of stores already in place and signed. As we move towards that north of 100 to 120 range, I would tell you that we would be very discriminate in the softer sales environment and making sure that we make the right choices on those stores as we of move forward. But we'll give you more guidance on the next conference call in January as to the 2017 store plan.", "Alan Rifkin", "Are you at liberty to say how many of the stores for 2017 are already signed?", "Greg Sandfort", "I would say \u2013 well, we don't usually give out that number. But I would say that number is defined, this is Greg. And I want you to think about something that most people don't realize, Alan.", "Back in '08 and '09, we were growing our store base at 10%. We saw a similar type of headwind occur and we said, you know what, we're going to slow down to about 7% to 8% and hold there for a while until the economies at that time would improve.", "We're seeing a little bit of the same kind of drag, a little different variables this time than last. So Tony's comment earlier about you know, we may not be at the 115, 120, that's always been a target, by the way.", "In real estate, you can in a moment's notice lose two or three stores because deals can't be completed or there is a problem with the contractor or what have you. So for 2016, that's more of the instance. We wanted to get more stores opened, we just could not. But we'll talk more about that in specific as we get through the fourth quarter and we give our guidance for next year.", "Alan Rifkin", "Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.", "Greg Sandfort", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.", "Scott Mushkin", "Hey, thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So just want to clarify a couple things. The stores that are not in the 25% that are feeling the wins of oil and agriculture, are they comping 3% to 5% in your \u2013 just to be very specific?", "Greg Sandfort", "When it comes to those stores comping 3% to 5%, as we mentioned the Southeast and the West. The Southeast more on the lower end, the West is actually exceeding the upper end.", "Now, again, I'd point out that the West has a less mature store base, given the stores that we opened over the last couple years. So we would expect them to comp a little bit stronger, but they have had very strong sales in those areas.", "Again, those stores that are highly correlated, obviously, the gap with a normalized comp is much greater, and then there is a swath of stores that range in between those numbers.", "Scott Mushkin", "Perfect. Then, one other clarification. I know you guys talked about September, two weeks into October, is the momentum continuing?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, what we see in October are similar trends as in September, and as we moved into this quarter, we did anticipate that October will be the toughest compare. And obviously the quarter is going to really be driven by November and December and the type of weather that he we have in those two months.", "Scott Mushkin", "Perfect. Now, to my real question, so much more of a kind of a secular question. So, obviously, you guys have some cyclical issues now. But if you kind of take a longer view, comps have been kind of slowing for a while, return on invested capital turned down about 18 months. How do you kind of view this?", "And then, of course, you went out and made an acquisition, an adjacent acquisition. How do you view more the - what looks to be more of a secular slowing of the business versus what\u2019s going on cyclically? And thank you for taking my questions.", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, what I would tell you initially is that when you look back at the comps, we\u2019ve had some very nice comps over the last 3 years and in an environment with mostly deflation. And obviously, as we get into some of these periods where we have a downturn in the economy, we\u2019re going to be impacted.", "But we continue to believe that we\u2019ll make the necessary adjustments with the merchandising, we'll continue to drive strong store performance. And as these economies turn, we're going to be very well positioned to continue towards our long-term goal of 3% to 5% comps.", "Scott Mushkin", "All right. Thanks, guys.", "Greg Sandfort", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs.", "Stephen Tanal", "Okay. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, a lot of ground covered. And I guess, just a question for Steve maybe, is there anything going on in merchandising, any initiative that you guys are thinking about or new product categories or specific products, if you will, anything that you\u2019re excited about that we should be thinking about here, as we look out quarter or two quarters and maybe even into next year?", "Steve Barbarick", "You know, there is a lot going on in the merchandising front. I would tell you that the team is all over certain trends right now. We continue to see in the pet and animal side people stepping up the premium, natural foods. We've just expanded a number of organic products in the stores.", "We still see our customers tend to self reliant. So the thing that we're doing with chicken supplies and beekeeping, we've got resets that are taking place throughout the store right now on both sides that we think we can capitalize on things like premium, rubber footwear and things in truck accessories. So there is a variety of things.", "We've always said that we're a test and learn company, and we've been testing and learning a lot, and we're rolling and expanding a lot of programs out. So from that perspective, there is still a lot in the hopper.", "Just most recently we expanded our animal test from 25 stores to 100 stores, thinking that this would be a good quarter to learn a little bit more in. In sporting goods, for example, we've got premium coolers and kayaks and other things going on. So if I were to walk a store with you and walk through the entire four walls, I would tell you there's something happening in about every area.", "Stephen Tanal", "Okay. That's good to hear. And moving on to the loyalty card, I don't know - some companies from time to time actually quantified a lift that you get from sales. I don't know if there's anything like that that you see. Obviously over time there's more you can do with the data. But I'm curious to know if there has been a lift in sort of the test markets?", "Steve Barbarick", "Stephen, this is Steve again. I would tell you that it's still early in the game for us. While we've got a handful of stores that have comped the first year, we're now just comping over last year's and we're going to be able to give you much better indication on the next call. But I will tell you we wouldn't be expanding it if we didn't feel like we were getting a benefit.", "Stephen Tanal", "Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.", "Dan Wewer", "Thanks. I believe in some prior calls you noted that e-commerce revenues were less than 1% of total, certainly recognize there are some of these products that are not friendly for online shopping. But nevertheless would you think that your penetration should be exceeding that level given the investments that have been made?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. Dan, this is Steve again. I would tell you that we're seeing nice momentum in this space. We've added a number of new lines, online in content and we're seeing good growth there, as you know, that we've invested in the new platform. We've mobile optimized our website to ensure there is a consistent consumer experience across the device.", "And most recently the impact of Buy Online Pickup in Store is having a very positive impact on our business. I think that alone tied in with the initiatives we have, some around the fulfillment side, you'll see that percentage grow over time and once it becomes more material, we'll be able to share with you exactly where we're at.", "But I would tell you that there's a lot of work being done and we're very excited about what we're doing right now. And we're seeing the results of it.", "Dan Wewer", "Second question. I know that you are still targeting 3% to 5% secular same store sales growth. Can that be achieved if energy markets stabilize at current levels? Or do those markets need to rebound to where they were, say, 2 or 3 years ago to achieve that 3% to 5% company wide target?", "Greg Sandfort", "Hey, Dan, this is Greg. Very difficult to predict as you can imagine, but those energy markets we're watching closely and I would say that we can't predict if they are going to be any worse or any better.", "But my prediction if I was going to give one on this is a slight up-tick in that business down there to stabilize would give our customers the confidence to go back and start spending again on some of those categories that we believe right now from the survey work we've done, and they're sitting back, holding their money. They are not releasing those funds right now because they are nervous. Once they can settle down I do think we'll start to see some movement back, yes.", "Dan Wewer", "And just one real quick question. A year ago we were discussing some of the weaker first year sales volumes in Arizona and in Utah. Now we're talking about the strength in the Western markets.", "Are we seeing those stores that opened up at slower revenues, are they achieving that faster same store sales growth now that they are in their second year?", "Tony Crudele", "Dan, this is Tony. When we look at the comps and sort of the store maturation cycle, we've always said that the newer stores are going to ramp at a higher pace than the chain. When in good times and the chain is moving out at your 3 to 5 comp, you know, we're going to be at a delta above that. We're seeing that the stores out West are running above that normalized delta. But given that, obviously, the rest of the chain is very flat, obviously that helps to increase the delta between the mature stores and the new stores out there.", "But what I would tell you is that, yes, some of the stores that came out slow are ramping at a much nicer pace. We're very pleased with those stores, and that's why when we look at the new store productivity and we spent a great deal of time looking at it, we look at it more on a rolling 12.", "We know that some of the stores last year that we talked about came out a little bit soft. So we know that we probably have this lower new store productivity over the course of the year. But when we look at it and look at it over a 12 \u2013 rolling 12, it's relatively consistent for the last four quarters. It has gone down slightly.", "Some of the West stores have come out slower. That's probably one of the bigger drivers and some of the West stores also had a little bit more square footage as we've had some additional square footage so that we could have more allocation for the feed products since they tend to be strong feed stores.", "So that distorts the calculation a little as well. But IRR hurdle has not changed. We're meeting pro forma. And so we feel very good about the new stores, especially as we see the stores out West ramp.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "Good evening, everyone. Just to let you know, the Cleveland Indians are up three nothing.", "Greg Sandfort", "Oh, man.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "Somebody mentioned earlier your taking \u2013 about taking your data warehouse, my words, in house and starting to manage that. How does that work as you start to roll out the loyalty card? And I assume they are connected?", "Greg Sandfort", "Yes, they are connected. I mean, we brought the database in house, it was last month. And what we're going to be able to do now is mine it with our own folks rather than outsourcing it to a third-party. So all the enrollments, all the customer data we have will be here and we'll be able to manage it accordingly.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "And was there any problem connecting shopper data to the individuals to specific market baskets while it was done outside of the company or is that all dependent on the loyalty program?", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, no, I mean, what the loyalty program will do is give us access to every single one of the purchases they make as they go into our stores. But whether it was outsourced before or whether it\u2019s in house we're not going to see any material difference in the data itself, it's just how we'll mine the data.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "All right. Thank you. Good luck for the rest of the year.", "Greg Sandfort", "Good luck to you, Chuck.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam Sindler", "Yes, hi. Good afternoon, guys. Quick question on Petsense and more just about the timing of the announcement. It seems or if I remember correctly that this sort of thought process was that you have a bunch of stores in front you to open, and that is the main focus, you know, probably no acquisitions during that time frame.", "Petsense is obviously very small, but again it does seem like a different customer based on what you\u2019re saying about your learning\u2019s from HomeTown Pet. So now in a difficult macro environment, you sort of have to try and manage two related, but different businesses.", "And related to questions about maybe where we are on the broader picture, what should we be thinking about the timing of this announcement, why now, I guess, is sort of the general question?", "Greg Sandfort", "Adam, this is Greg. Two things to remember on Petsense, one is it is not going to be a distraction for TSC, and it will not really look to take any type of funding and resources from TSC.", "As a matter of fact, it\u2019s a well run little company. It is small in base today, but has tremendous growth opportunity, and it will basically fund itself. So don\u2019t worry about trying to run two businesses. They are not going to be integrated. It\u2019s a separate business. It runs separately. It has its own president and its own staff of people, and there would be no integration, this was a strategic buy and not an integration buy, there is the difference.", "Adam Sindler", "Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Joseph Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Cristina Fernandez", "Hi. Good afternoon. This is Cristina Fernandez for Joe. We wanted to ask about the incentive compensation. You talked about $0.07 to $0.08 headwind being a normalized compensation for next year, but then at the same time EPS coming in below that mid teens range, so how do you reconcile the two?", "Tony Crudele", "Well, Cristina, this is Tony. What we\u2019re saying is that our incentive compensation is based against our plan. So as we move into 2017 and we create a new plan, we have to allocate to the incentive compensation expense line relative to our projected 2017 plan.", "So as we go through this year with very limited incentive compensation in the expense structure, once we recalibrate next year and put a new plan together, we need to put an on plan incentive compensation. So we estimate that if we move back relative year-over-year that there would be an increase in the expense structure of $0.07 to $0.08 to the bottom line.", "So having said that, we're just saying, I'm just giving you notice that you need to adjust your models accordingly as a lot of people have been looking at this year's expense run rate and applying it to next year. So you just need to be able to add in some incentive compensation into your model next year if you have not already.", "Cristina Fernandez", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Greg Sandfort for closing comments.", "Greg Sandfort", "Well, thank you, everyone, and thank you for your continued support in Tractor Supply. We'll look forward to speaking with you again in January regarding our fourth quarter and full year 2016 performance.", "Operator", "Once again, that does conclude today's call.

We ask that all participants limit themselves to one question with one follow-up.", "Please be advised that reproduction of this call in whole or in part is not permitted without written authorization of Tractor Supply Company. And, as a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ms. Christine Skold of Tractor Supply Company. Christine, please go ahead.", "Christine E. Skold - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you, Kevin.

On the call with me today are Steve Barbarick, our President and Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; Tony Crudele, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Kurt Barton, our Senior VP and Controller and soon to be Chief Financial Officer, as Tony plans to retire in early March of this year.", "We are pleased with our fourth quarter results. It was obviously a challenging retail environment, and our team at Tractor Supply managed the business well and drove both the top and the bottom line. We focused on driving our sales in several of our key categories and kept our inventories balanced across the entire company.", "On a market-by-market basis, we aligned our businesses from all sides using merchandising, pricing promotion and inventory. We spent considerable time last year managing the business around weather trends and geographical pockets of both strength and weakness. While we never have all of the answers, through careful planning and execution, we successfully drove growth in the fourth quarter. Comparable store sales increased 3.1%, and were positive across every region.", "Strength in sales came from everyday basic items across a number of consumable, usable and edible categories and hardline-related categories such as livestock and pet, bird, trailers and accessories, hand tools and livestock equipment, to mention a few.", "These are the types of products that our customers buy based upon need and seasonal change. They are the core of our business at Tractor Supply. And as indicated on our last earnings call, we believed we could drive these areas of our business in the fourth quarter with the right planning and execution.", "Throughout the quarter, the team worked diligently to further localize assortments, manage the flow of inventory and improve the speed of replenishment to our stores. In over 100 Deep South stores, we maintained a spring-summer assortment of lawn and garden products to address year-round consumer demand.", "In our northern-based stores, due to the extended warm weather, we adjusted assortments early in the quarter to capture sales in warm weather products, while pacing the delivery of cold weather products. Our vendor base and supply chain were cued to react. And as the weather turned cooler in December, we were able to flow additional winter-related products to our stores to capture sales.", "We did a lot of listening to both our field team members and our customers in the back half of last year. We know our customers want more access to shop for the products they need. And as a result, we increased the number of products online through our drop ship program and expanded our Buy Online Pickup in Store Program in the latter half of the year.", "We also know that many of our customers want to interact with Tractor Supply on a more personalized level. Thus, we accelerated the rollout of our Neighbor's Club program. Customers continue to be eager to sign up for the program, and enrollment rates continue to exceed our forecast.", "As more customers sign on to the program, we have seen an increase in our attribution, click-through and redemption rates. The program was live in over 600 stores at year-end, and we plan to complete the rollout across the chain in the second quarter of 2017.", "We increased staffing in stores in an effort to improve customer service and sales conversion. In categories such as gifts, toys, footwear and apparel where we saw challenges in sales early in the quarter, we kept a watchful eye on inventory and where necessary, acted appropriately to clear excess inventory to ensure we were well transitioned at year-end.", "Looking forward, we remain confident and committed to driving bottom line growth through a balanced approach of managing sales, margins, and our operating expenses. We have a number of new products and category resets in the stores for the first half of the year. And from a systems and technology standpoint, we continue to execute on our digital priorities to provide the merchandising, customer facing and logistics capabilities needed to support our growth.", "With our long-term logistics infrastructure in place now, we will begin construction of our new distribution center in the Northeast later this year and we'll expand our distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska as well.", "Now with respect to Petsense, the management team has plans to grow the store base by 25 to 30 stores in 2017. I just returned from the Petsense national stores sales manager meetings, where I met many of the Petsense store managers and gained a deeper appreciation of their localized customer focus.", "I must share with you how excited I continue to be about their opportunities for growth. Petsense has a proven store growth model, and with the addition of a digital component at some point, this will only broaden the offerings for the small town pet customer.", "Tractor Supply is currently sharing best practices with Petsense, and we look forward to continued growth in their business. In January of this year, we did convert our two original HomeTown Pet stores and they are now part of the Petsense operation.", "2016 was certainly a more challenging year for our company. But we are not standing still, waiting for the business climate to improve. Instead, we are taking proactive measures to move our business forward, managing those things we can control and continuing to invest in our future growth. We are a growth company and will continue to be a growth company.", "We have a solid core business that is focused on a dedicated lifestyle customer who depends upon us for the products they need to live their lifestyle. Over the longer term, our priorities will continue to be focused on our people and their development, enhancing our merchandise offerings, and adding digital capabilities to meet the ever evolving demands of our customers, while always maintaining our goal of returning value to our shareholders through sustainable growth.", "As I wrap up, I want to thank the more than 24,000 members of the Tractor Supply family for their continued hard work, dedication, and the level of service they provide to our customers. A big goo rah to everyone in our stores, our Merchandise Innovation Center, our distribution facilities and our Store Support Center. All of you have contributed to making Tractor Supply the great company it is today.", "And as previously announced, our CFO Tony Crudele, will be retiring in March, making this his last earnings call. Tony has been a tremendous partner to me. And he played an integral role in Tractor Supply's growth and success over the past 11 years. I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to Tony for his leadership, his dedication, his stewardship of our culture, his friendship and his many contributions to Tractor Supply.", "With that said, I will now turn the call over to Tony one last time for a more detailed commentary on our fourth quarter financial results. Then, Kurt Barton, our incoming CFO, will take us through our initial outlook for 2017.", "Anthony F. Crudele - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to take a minute to thank Greg for allowing me to be part of the best team in retail as well as thank all of our dedicated team members that are truly the heart and soul of Tractor Supply and have made the past 11 years the best of my career. We will be completing the transition at the end of February, so hopefully I will see many of you before then. But I wanted to thank the investment community and our many analysts that have supported the company and me over the years. Your insights and professionalism have made us a better company, and I'm very fortunate to have had the opportunity to interact with all of you.", "Now back to business at hand. For the quarter, ended December 31, 2016, on a consolidated year-over-year basis comparable store sales increased 3.1%. Net sales increased 16.4%, to $1.92 billion. Net income increased 10.6% to $123.6 million, and EPS increased 14.6% to $0.94 per diluted share. Demand for our core everyday basic items remained steady throughout the quarter. However, demand was limited for winter-related products during the months of October and November due to a warm start to the quarter combined with an unseasonably warm winter last year, which limited early season urgency.", "When cold weather arrived, the consumer responded positively and we saw a lift in seasonal sales. As a result, sales were the strongest in the month of December, as cold weather drove sales of winter seasonal merchandise such as heating fuel, insulated outerwear and power equipment.", "We managed the warmer than normal months of October and November by taking advantage of an extended summer selling season, most significantly in parts of the Southeast and Texas, where we maintained a full assortment of summer-related products in response to continued customer demand for seasonal products.", "As Greg mentioned, we experienced strong demand for many of our basic everyday items in both hardline-related areas and C.U.E. such as livestock and pet category, which generated mid-single-digit comparable chain-wide sales. These benefits were partially offset by softness in categories such as safes, footwear, gift and decor.", "Comparable store sales were positive across all regions. The strongest performance was in the Southeast and West. The performance of the Southeast region was broad-based and also benefited from the sale of emergency response products related to Hurricane Matthew. We continue to see strength in the Western region, as we expand our store base and gain market awareness and share.", "Comp transaction count increased for the 35th consecutive quarter, gaining 4% on top of a 0.6% increase last year. Comparable transactions were driven by continued strength of our C.U.E. items such as pet and animal food as well as heating consumables. Average comp ticket decreased by approximately 90 basis points compared to last year's decline of 190 basis points.", "Deflation and big ticket sales decline were the two primary drivers of this quarter's average ticket decrease. Deflation was slightly higher than we anticipated at approximately 60 basis points, driven principally by livestock feed, bird feed and lubricant categories.", "Comparable sales of big ticket items were down low-single digits year-over-year. Because of the warm start to the quarter, sales of cold weather-related big ticket products such as log splitters and stoves were down. These are items that tend to be purchased earlier in the season and can be influenced by the weather.", "As a reminder, the fourth quarter included an extra sales week as part of the company's 53-week calendar in 2016. The 53rd week also included one additional comparable store sales day in the quarter. We estimate that that additional comp day added approximately 60 basis points to same-store sales in the fourth quarter.", "The additional week represented 6.2 percentage points of the overall 16.4% sales increase for the quarter and provided an estimated $0.055 benefit to diluted earnings per share. Petsense store sales are not reflected in same-store sales as those stores will fall into the store base beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017.", "Now turning to gross margin, which decreased 35 basis points to 33.7% compared to no change in the prior year. The merchandise team continue to proactively manage both sales and gross margin during a challenging sales environment. We were sharper on price to drive traffic and create value for the consumer. In certain holiday and discretionary products, we accelerated markdowns earlier to ensure that we ended the season in a clean inventory position.", "The mix of merchandise negatively impacted gross margin by an estimated 13 basis points. This was driven by the strong sales in C.U.E. products specifically animal and pet food, bird feed and heating fuel which are below chain average margin categories along with softness in higher margin categories such as footwear, gifts and decor.", "Freight was generally flat the prior year. Lower diesel prices along with lower import costs were offset by higher inbound transportation costs and a greater mix of freight intensive categories.", "For the quarter, SG&A including depreciation and amortization was flat as a percent of sales to 23.6%. SG&A was impacted by several factors. We benefited from strong expense control from our cost saving programs along with leverage from the solid comparable store sales growth.", "We are very pleased with our expense management during the quarter which resulted in leverage of store occupancy, medical and related payroll cost, as well as other store and Store Support Center costs. We continued to benefit from our LED lighting retrofit initiative resulting in lower utility and related maintenance costs.", "As part of our focus on enhancing the customer experience, we allocated more payroll hours to our stores and invested in additional marketing throughout the quarter. And, therefore, we experienced deleverage in both of these expense categories.", "Additionally, the impact of consolidating the Petsense operations along with onetime charge related to the acquisition of Petsense resulted in an incremental 40 basis points to SG&A in the quarter. Incentive compensation did not have a material impact on SG&A in the fourth quarter.", "Total consolidated SG&A expense grew 16.5% from the prior year. We estimate the 53rd week added approximately 5.9% to the year-over-year SG&A growth for the quarter. Exclusive of the 53rd week, the onetime acquisition and integration cost of about $2.4 million and the Petsense SG&A expenses, SG&A grew only 6.7% over the prior year. Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was 36% compared to 35.4% last year. The increase in the rate is principally due to timing of federal and state tax credits in the prior year.", "Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the year, we had a cash balance of $53.9 million and $274 million outstanding debt compared to cash balance of $63.8 million and $150 million outstanding debt at the end of last year. During the fourth quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired 1.7 million shares for $116 million. Also during the fourth quarter, we acquired Petsense for $145.7 million, funded through cash-on-hand and revolver debt.", "Average inventory levels per store for Tractor Supply stores decreased 2.9%. We managed our inventory well in the quarter and are comfortable with our seasonal inventory as we move into 2017. Capital expenditures for the year were $226 million compared to $236.5 million last year. We opened up 21 stores and closed one Del's store in the fourth quarter.", "For the year, we opened 113 stores and closed six Del's stores. The decrease in capital expenditures relates to cycling of the construction of our Southwest distribution center last year, offset in part by a greater mix of retrofit locations for new stores which generally require renovation capital and incremental capital to fund our LED lighting retrofit project.", "So, now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kurt to discuss our initial outlook for 2017.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thanks Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. We expect consolidated full year sales to range from $7.22 billion to $7.29 billion. We have forecasted comp sales to range between 2% and 3%. We are estimating EBIT margin to decline by 25 basis points to 40 basis points. We anticipate net income to range from approximately $445 million to $457 million, or $3.44 to $3.52 per diluted share.", "We expect to open approximately 100 new Tractor Supply stores with around 45% scheduled to open in the first half of the year. We will continue the transition of our Del's stores and we expect to close nine Del's stores as we execute our Tractor Supply Western expansion plan. We expect to open approximately 25 to 30 Petsense stores which includes the conversion of the two HomeTown Pet stores to Petsense. All sales from Petsense will be included in non-comp sales through the third quarter of 2017.", "Additionally, we forecast that our effective tax rate will be in the range of 36.2% to 36.4%. Our adoption of the new accounting rules related to the recognition of incremental tax benefit on stock options exercises is estimated to have approximately 50 basis points favorable impact on the effective tax rate in 2017 and will more than offset the headwind of cycling the benefit from federal and state tax credits in 2016.", "We are initially targeting capital expenditures of $270 million to $290 million in 2017. The increase over 2016 results principally from the initial development of our Northeast distribution center, which is targeted to begin construction in second quarter of 2017 and expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018, with capital allocated over that time.", "Other key initiatives that we have identified for 2017 include expansion of our distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska, an upgrade to our warehouse management system, completion of the LED lighting retrofit for the remaining 700 stores and further enhancements to build out our digital and omni-channel capabilities.", "We plan to continue to make purchases under our share repurchase program as part of our long-term balanced approach to shareholder return. We expect to be in a borrowed position at the end of each quarter and target the year-end debt position to range between $400 million and $450 million.", "We anticipate interest expense to be in the $10 million range in fiscal 2017. For modeling purposes, we estimate that diluted shares outstanding inclusive of option grant and share repurchase activity will be between 129.5 million to 130 million for the full year.", "Now, let me discuss some of the assumptions that helped us form our projections for 2017. Our toughest sales comparison in 2017 will be in Q1, as we have both a strong start to 2016 in January with extreme cold, followed by an early start to spring with a warmer than normal March.", "As a reminder, we believe last year's first quarter sales benefited from some pull-forward of spring sales. As we have emphasized in the past, we believe our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the halves, not the quarters. As different weather patterns from year-to-year can shift the timing of sales between quarters, particularly the first and second quarters.", "Last year deflation increased slightly and averaged approximately 40 basis points. This year we expect deflation to moderate but continue to be a headwind ranging between 10 basis points to 30 basis points with it moderating in the back half of the year.", "Due to the calendar shift, as well as the timing of Easter, the second quarter and the full year 2017 will have one less comp sales day compared to 2016. We estimate that the extra comp sales day contributed approximately 60 basis points to the fourth quarter of 2016 and 15 basis points to the full year.", "Let me also refer you to the 2016 comparable store sales table on the last page of our earnings release as this provides a bridge to the adjustment for the week shift in the calendar.", "We are targeting a net 25 basis point to 30 basis point increase in consolidated gross margin for the full year. We would expect improvements in gross margin rate to come from the execution of our key gross margin initiatives, including price management, continued strong markdown and inventory management, strategic sourcing and exclusive brands.", "We expect those benefits to be partially offset by the following items. Freight expense is expected to be a headwind of approximately 10 basis points this year with anticipation of higher diesel prices and import shipping costs. We are also estimating deleverage of 10 basis points from the mix of merchandise, principally from the growth in animal and pet food.", "With respect to Petsense, as they produce a higher gross margin rate than Tractor Supply stores, we anticipate a slight favorable impact of approximately 10 basis points.", "In terms of gross margin performance by quarter, we forecast a year-over-year improvement in each of the quarters. With respect to SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, we anticipate SG&A deleverage of approximately 60 basis points to 80 basis points this year.", "Factors to consider are, in 2016 we had a significant decrease in incentive compensation year-over-year. As our incentive program is based on performance to plan, we would expect that a more normalized incentive compensation for this year would have about 20 basis point impact on SG&A. Allocated over the last nine months of the year, as the first quarter of 2016 performance was strong and had a more normalized incentive cost.", "We expect payroll and related payroll expenses to delever as we commit to strong customer service levels in our stores, along with cycling favorable medical costs in the prior year. Depreciation expense is expected to grow double-digits over the prior year and will delever, resulting from the LED lighting retrofit program, and technology related investments, with shorter average lives.", "This year is a 52-week year, thus, fourth quarter will have one last week relative to 2016. In 2016, the additional leverage gained from the 53rd week benefited SG&A in the fourth quarter by approximately 10 basis points and approximately $0.055 per diluted share. In 2017, we will incur some exit costs to close nine Del's stores principally in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that Petsense will have a 20 basis point to 25 basis point unfavorable impact on SG&A due to their high growth model with less mature stores.", "With respect to SG&A by quarter, we do not anticipate any of the quarters to leverage. We believe the first quarter will be the least challenging comparison as it had a more normalized incentive compensation. As in the past, we will provide more color regarding our expectations for the subsequent period in each quarterly conference call. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We'll take our first question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray", "Hey, thanks a lot everyone. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk about the demand trends during the quarter and I was particularly interested in if you saw any inflection or change before and after the election. And also if there was any change in demand outside of weather. Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Peter, this is Greg. We did not really see any significant movement before or after the election. So I would tell you, no, not much change there. But we did have the favorability of weather as it broke in the latter part of November and December. That did help the business, no question, brought customers in to purchase heating products, cold weather products and alike. A little soft in the first part of the quarter, very strong in the latter part of the quarter.", "Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Thank you. And then I assume there's no change. But last quarter there was discussion around both the energy markets and ag markets, which each I believe are about 10% of your store base. Maybe could you comment on those for the fourth quarter and how you anticipate those trending in 2017?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well, first of all, the ag markets are somewhat incidental. I think, as we saw the weather change, we would say that more of the impact was weather than it was things happening in the ag markets. Secondly, in Texas and in the energy markets, we saw a slight recovery but nothing that was that significant yet. We'd like to hope that it will continue to improve, but it was very slight.", "Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck this year.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "You're welcome.", "Anthony F. Crudele - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Go ahead.", "Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe just a follow up on that last question, as you think about the cadence for 2017 \u2013 and you guys gave a lot of color, so I appreciate that but I'm not sure if you could comment on how Q1 has started off specifically. But if we assume Q1 comps are lower, it would imply the rest of the year gets back to that high end of the historical range of 3% to 5%. Is that the right way to think about it? And if so, what have you sort of embedded in here as the drivers of that improvement? Thank you.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Hey Seth, this is Kurt. First, I'll point you to the comparable sales table just to kind of recognize the shift in the comps. Q1 was strong last year, and it is a tough comparison. But as we look at the \u2013 our assumptions for the year, we look at first and second half, both of the halves falling within the sales range that we gave you. So we anticipate some balance between Q1 and Q2, again, with the second half falling within the range also that we provided for 2017.", "Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. Got it. And then a separate topic on some of the payroll investments that you made in the fourth quarter and are expecting to make in 2017. Could you elaborate on those changes, and what prompted you to go down this path? Clearly, service has always been a strong point here, but just curious what's changing on that front? Thanks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Seth, this is Greg. What I would tell you is that we were listening to our customers and our team members. And we track our customer service scores very closely, and we noticed in the early part of the year our scores were not as healthy as we would have liked. And John Ortis (30:55) and I \u2013 John runs all of our storage organization, sat down and we said we're going to protect payroll in the fourth quarter. We're going to make sure that payroll is protected. And we believe that that was also part of the sales improvement that we had. Team members on the floor able to assist customers and give that traditional legendary service that we always talk about. So it was a conscious decision. I believe it paid off well and as we're looking at payroll for 2017, we will look to make similar adjustments as we go through the year.", "Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Does it at all change how you guys think about the ability to get leverage going forward, what type of comp needed?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well that's always taken into consideration. And the plan, the payroll plan is we believe the way we've got it laid out for 2017 is more than adequate to play back to what we've got planned quarter by quarter in our sales comps. But if we start to see an acceleration of sales, John and I have agreed, we're going to start adding more payroll. And if we see sales retract a bit, we're going to hold payroll because we don't believe that taking payroll out of the stores and affecting the things that are closest to the customer can pay any big benefit. We'll take cost out someplace else in the company.", "Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Go ahead, please.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats Tony. We'll certainly miss you, but \u2013 and welcome Kurt. Steve, could you talk maybe a little bit about the first half resets. I think Greg mentioned some things that were on top from a merchandising perspective. What can we expect to see and what do you think are going to be the biggest drivers this year in terms of merchandising?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yes, good question. I mean this is one of the things that's really helped fuel our growth in the past and it's really a point of differentiation for us. I'd frame it up in a couple of ways here. First I would talk about new products. And when you talk about new products, we've got two or three events that are planned for the center court that are going to be fairly significant. Things in the Garden event, and our Chick Days event as well as what we're doing with outdoor sports will add hundreds of new items to this treasure hunt experience that our customers have come to rely on us for.", "In addition to that, I would tell you that one of the key resets that we'll be looking at and we're executing it right now on our stores, is our stores aren't getting any bigger. That said, using our air rights is something that we're going to take advantage of. We've got 1,000 stores today that are executing a program on the right side of our store mainly in a key area of our business that being pet and in some of the C.U.E. areas. And we are going to take the beams from 72 inches up to 84 inches, which will give us between 20 linear feet and 24 linear feet to bring in new products and to help fuel the continued growth that we're seeing in that side of our business.", "And then the last thing I would tell you is that, we're a company and you've heard us say this in the past that believes in test and learn. I'm going to change it to test and roll, not to confuse you here, but we've tested a number of programs and we're rolling a bunch of these programs out to more stores. Give you three quick examples. Carhartt, we are expanding our assortments and the look of the layouts in a couple hundred stores. We will be expanding a hay program and forge program into another couple of hundred stores. And we're seeing success in the stores that have brought in the new Muck shops, which is premium rubber footwear. And those vignettes will be going into a couple hundred stores. That's just a few to name. There's plenty more on the docket, but I would tell you that we're excited about the changes that are going to be happening inside of the box.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "That's helpful. Thank you. And then just somewhat related, a little bit on private label where it's already north of 30% here. But where do you think you can lean further into that and how does that play into your thinking about how your merchandise online and kind of keep this business a little more insulated from some online risk of disremediation there. Thank you.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "It's a great point. So we're very fortunate that 10 years or so ago we started really focusing on what we call exclusive brands. And we have seen nice growth there, and I will tell you, 4Health, which is our store brand for pet food, continues to take market share we believe and continues to grow which keeps us somewhat insulated. This coming year you'll see an expansion of that program. Originally it started off with basic ingredients then we went to grain free. And now we're going to be adding a line that's really targeted nutrition, supporting our customers that own cats and dogs that might have needs that are around sensitive skin, sensitive stomach, weight management, things that we weren't able to support before with our own exclusive brands.", "Another great example would be our DuMOR line of livestock feed. Last year we upgraded the nutrition around our equine segment. And we're going to be rolling out organic chicken food within our own line of exclusive brand this coming year. And then the last one I would note and I like to give you all examples so they're somewhat tangible, is that we're taking what we had in electric fencing and converting that entire aisle to a control brand, which we'll roll into an exclusive brand. We'll be the only ones who have it. It'll be called American FarmWorks. And that reset is taking place, as we now speak.", "So a lot of exciting things on the exclusive brand front. Not only will they help differentiate us, keep us a little more insulated, they also come with a little better margin and value to the consumer.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Terrific. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.", "Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Congratulations, Tony. I'll see you in February, but figured last call. Just first follow-up on the cadence. I think Seth asked this earlier. Kurt, you mentioned that you think the halves actually may be I thought pretty similar. There is a tough compare in Q1. I guess some were thinking it could be negative. I know you're not guiding specifically. I don't think you were trying to imply that it wouldn't be, but that it would just even out.", "And then thinking about the fourth quarter, I think, you're encouraging us to look at the adjustments in the release, meaning the fourth quarter compare actually is a little tougher based on the adjustments. And then can you tell us, within that, is Petsense very material to Q4 comp, meaning how much should it add by next year's fourth quarter?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure. Starting with the first question on the first half and first quarter, yes, I would say that we're not indicating that Q1 is that strong of a headwind. It is a challenge to us. And I would encourage you to look at it as a half between Q1 and Q2 and that there could be some challenges. Just, I'll \u2013 March is the one month that is the biggest month that is impactful for Q1. And I would say that for Q1 we'd expect it to be below our target range that we stated of 2% to 3%.", "In fourth quarter, we do recognize that it does have a strong comp. We're also considering, as Greg mentioned, that we did see a soft October-November with the warm weather. So for a number of reasons, we still see strength in our opportunities in Q4 in the back half.", "Petsense, not material. And I would say comping them, which would be only the fourth quarter where they would introduce as a comp, would not be a significant factor.", "Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then my follow-up \u2013 this is a question, I think, asked of Greg earlier, and I'll put it in this way. I don't know if the answer is going to be any different. But if we look at the spread in performance between, let's say, the healthier and the impacted markets, whatever the causes of those impacted markets, it sounds like the business improved maybe because some of the healthier markets got stronger but not necessarily the weaker markets stabilized or got better. I don't know if that's fair, if you can just clarify please?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Simeon, it's Greg. I would tell you that it was very similar. I wouldn't categorize that the markets that were healthy were healthier and the markets that were difficult were more difficult. We saw a little bit of a bottoming effect, I guess, earlier in maybe the third and fourth quarter. We started to see a little improvement in the energy markets. But in general, the rest of the markets were performing similarly honestly from quarter to quarter.", "So the big culprit was what we talked about. You had energy markets that had an impact. Most people continue to forget about deflation, but deflation is a serious component when it comes to a lot of the products that we sell. When we're selling a bag of bird seed a year ago at $20 a bag, and this year it's at $14. That's tough to offset. We did have a little bit of drag, I would say, with weather early, but that came back in December. So not a lot of movement, Simeon, really not a lot of movement.", "Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Lasser with UBS. Go ahead please.", "Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC", "Good evening. Thanks a lot (40:52) for taking my question. And it's kind of simple. Is 2% to 3% the right long run comp growth to think about for the business now?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. Michael, this is Kurt. We're giving guidance for 2017. And as we've seen the trends and the headwinds we had in 2016, we have explained the challenges that we see for 2017.", "We're not giving more guidance necessarily for years beyond 2017. We still see us as a growth company and a lot of opportunity. So in regards to beyond 2017, we still feel confident with the target ranges that we've given for Tractor Supply.", "Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC", "And my second question is, Greg, you mentioned some increased promotions in the fourth quarter, some increased labor and some favorable weather. So to what extent did your internal initiatives drive the comp? And to what extent was it the external environment that drove the comp? Again, this is just in an effort to try and understand what the long...", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Great question, Mike. But one thing I can tell you is we didn't buy comps. Comps came because of the fact that we have the right products and we were able to react to the business as that weather broke. And I would tell you that the promotional cadence was slightly more, but nothing extreme. And you know us, we don't believe in buying sales. We like to run a good steady business. And we reacted when we saw some soft performance in some categories, see the (42:38) team reacted and started either being a little bit more aggressive in those categories or taking some earlier markdowns to make sure that we came out of the season clean. But other than that, it wasn't anything heroic that we did.", "Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Go ahead, please.", "Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thanks. Greg, I wanted to talk about the decision to slow the rate of new store openings from 113 in this last year to 100 in 2017. And I guess you'll have more flexibility to adjust the store openings the following year, but thinking what is the right annual number let's say after 2017?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good question, Dan. We had said a few years ago that the ultimate number would be 120-ish, if we could find all the locations, get all of the leases secured and we had enough people in the pipeline to be able to fill that. And we have tried year after year and the best we could come was I think about 116 a few years ago and then we started dropping back into that 107 to 113, 114 number. We think the 100 number is the bottom and we said, listen, at least 100 stores, we know we can open those. And it gives us a little bit of room because in some categories when you look at certain parts of the country, for example the Northeast. One of the reasons that we are building that new distribution center is because there's continued growth opportunities there but we can't get to those until we can service those.", "No different than what's happening in the West. We could not get to some of those opportunities until we opened Casa Grande. So that's probably more of the factor than anything else. And I'll also tell you, I don't know of another retailer that's opening 100 stores a year right now. The number kind of settled there at 100, but it'll be 100, maybe a few more than 100 depending upon when we can find the locations and of course getting that new distribution center open in the Northeast is going to be key for us.", "Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow up, looking at the operating margin rate forecasted to drop a bit in 2017, do you think that we've seen operating margin having peaked? This is meteoric increase the last seven years, and I know you're forecasting gross margin rates to grow. But are you at the point now where you believe it's probably best to reinvest savings back into the business to grow share rather than trying to grow operating margin rate?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Dan, it's a great question about balance. We always talk about the business, balancing sales, margin and how we handle inventories. I don't think that we are at the peak of our operating margin. I think that we've seen some headwinds in the last year to 18 months.", "As we clear through those headwinds, I think, we'll have more confidence in saying, beyond that point, are we of that number or is there still a little bit more room for growth. But I think we're optimistic there's still some more room for growth.", "We know some of the efficiencies that we have yet to gain inside the company, whether it be through supply chain, be it through how we're running our business with technology. And I think we need a little bit more time, as we get through this curve of headwinds, before I think we would give you any affirmative answer as to we think operating margin has either leveled off or there could be any more growth.", "Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Do you think capital expenditures are peaking this year at $280 million, $290 million, and then after the DCs are completed that drops or is this the new norm?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. I think that number could come down a little bit over time. I think it's a healthy number this year. We've not been \u2013 we have not hit the number we forecasted over the last several years. There's lots of things that come into play with capital, as you know, as you get into the scenario of spending for either building a building or retrofitting installing (46:54) new lighting and such. But, no, I think we're in the range, and we'll be there for at least the next year or two.", "Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good evening. So I just wanted to understand the comp day in the fourth quarter lapping that 60 basis points versus the second quarter. So, as we look at that table, which clearly lays out a shift making 1Q look a lot less daunting, but as you think about the second quarter, are we losing 100 basis points, 120 basis points, because you're lapping a Sunday as Easter hops into the second quarter? And then do we have to take the 60 basis points out, as we lap in the fourth quarter as well?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. Chris, there's a number of variables in that calculation, as to the timing of Easter and the volume in second quarter. We mentioned the 60 basis points impact in the fourth quarter as a point of reference to the value of the day. And our calculation would tell you that the value for the lost day in the second quarter is similar.", "So you will have that one headwind of 60 basis points in the second quarter. But there's a number of variables in regards to what day and what impact we get to the day subsequent to Easter after that. So best reference is 60 basis point impact on that day for the quarter.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then, is there an actual 60 basis point headwind in the fourth quarter or is that just \u2013 that was 2016 and that's gone?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Right. That's 2016, and that's gone.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Understood. And then, my follow-up question is, Greg you talked about sort of ag markets being, I guess, very small relative to your prior perception. So could you expand on that? How are you thinking about ag markets as a headwind as you face 2017 and in retrospect do you think ag markets was worth any discussion at all, frankly?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Frankly, I think we \u2013 it's not worth a discussion. As we've learned more, it was more of a weather effect than it was anything else. I think we need to focus our efforts around what's happening in energy markets. And then, as I said in my comments, maneuvering around some of the weather, I'll call it, conditions and things that we can only affect through reaction. We can't plan for that. I can't plan whether there will or won't be cold weather. I can't plan if it'll be warm or cold or rain or whatever.", "So I think that's the part of our company that sometimes, I think, people forget how nimble we are and how we can with our logistics and distribution network today really manage our inventories well, move inventory around as it's coming into the system, and take advantage of being able to react fast and move sales. But I think I'd like to focus on the things that I think are more challenging and that's the energy markets and then just how we manage weather. And then I'm not going to let any of you forget about deflation. Deflation is a factor. And it's somewhat flat, I guess, to maybe slightly up as we go into this year. But it was a factor of what, I think, about 40 basis points last year.", "So these are things we deal with. These are sometimes things that we don't talk about, but I'm convinced that we've got a good handle on the business, and the ag market thing is not worth really talking about.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Go ahead, please.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Good afternoon.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good afternoon.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "I want to start with your relationship with Revionics. When you consider the current consumer spending environment, has your view of the company's relationship with Revionics changed, maybe as it relates to the importance of the different modules? I know you spoke in the past about price being most important but you clearly mentioned promotional activity within the release, so can you just kind of update us on where you are with the relationship and how you view it over the next few years here?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure. Steven, this is Steve. I would tell you that we've got a solid relationship with the folks at Revionics. As a matter of fact, we renewed our contract, it was a year ago. Today we're using two of their promotional tools or their pricing tools that being basic price op as well as clearance. As we move forward, we'll be doing more due diligence around what promotional optimization looks like, what their tool looks like and others. But right now we're not at a point of making that decision. But we do recognize it's out there and that is something we'll be talking about for the future.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "And then, as a follow up, as it relates to the balance sheet, I mean I sit here and think about just how important you are to your suppliers and then look at the 35% to 40% payable to inventory ratio. And I would imagine that this ratio is much higher within the C.U.E. categories and I guess lower within the more discretionary categories. Is that fair and then how do you think about it as an opportunity, if it is one, over the next few years? And if you can touch on it, how big of an opportunity may it be?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure. Yes. That's a fair assessment. And we saw some improvement in the finance inventory this quarter. But I would say there was just a few small favorable impacts there. We are focused on it. We will be focused on it. We've got a number of things to address in that category. But that is an area over the next couple of years, I think, we can make some movement.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Steven, the other thing I would mention \u2013 this is Steve, just to kind of cap that as well. I mean, there's a variety of tools that we work with our vendors, and there's gives and takes. This is certainly one of the negotiables along with many others.", "I would tell you that where we've been able to make headway with our vendors may not necessarily be on this one line. If you look at the last year or so, our sales \u2013 top line sales hasn't been that strong. We had carried some inventory over a year ago.", "It is something that's on the docket to look at. But again, it goes back to a give and take and what do we want to really work with our vendors on to drive for the future. So I appreciate you bringing it up. It is in the consideration set, and we will look at it.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we go next to Matthew McClintock with Barclays. Go ahead, please.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. And, Tony, best wishes to you.", "Anthony F. Crudele - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I was wondering if we could talk about ticket for a second. Greg, you talked a little bit about the deflationary aspect on your business. But as I think broader, bigger picture, what's it going to take to get return ticket back to positive maybe accelerating \u2013 an accelerating trend? And is that more just having a recovery in the energy markets, the ag markets or is that more maybe having some inflation in some of your core inputs? Thanks.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Matthew this is Steve. There's a difference between big ticket and average ticket. And if you talk about the bigger ticket products that we've got in our stores, we've had some headwinds over the last several years. And one of those headwinds that we've publicly stated is safes.", "That business has been declining for us, and so we're kind of fighting an uphill battle in that category as well as a few others. What I can tell you is I don't believe it's the fact that the customer is still willing to spend if given the right opportunity and the right product.", "And then if you look at our business, the last three of the last four quarters we've seen a decline in big ticket. Now, that said, we are not giving up on big ticket and in talking with the team, we are resetting this coming year our commercial zero-turn mowers, which is under the Bad Boy brand.", "And we believe there's going to be some life in that business for us as we move forward. In addition to that, they've got a $6,000 unit and today it's been successful in a couple hundred of our stores and we're going to expand it into more stores.", "We're looking at testing Kawasaki engines in OPE in a couple markets to see, again, if customer is willing to spend if given a reason to do so.", "We're making traction in UTVs and you're going to see us rollout an $8,000 UTV to more stores, not the chain because we recognize there is some local needs here. And then the last one I'd leave you with, is because I do think it goes back to who and what we're about, and that is the trailer business for us is a good business. And customers have relied on us as a destination for that category. In this coming year, we are going to be testing a dual axle trailer, again with a retail of $2,000 in about 100 of our stores.", "So my point there is that, while we've seen some softness in big ticket, some of it could be oil, some of it could safes. We're not giving up on it. And we do believe there's a market there. We just got to give the customers a reason to buy from us.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we go next to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.", "Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Hey, Brian.", "Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "I wanted to focus back on the fourth quarter. We talked, had a lot of questions already on this, but can you give us maybe a better example on how much stronger December was than the first two months period as the weather turned?", "And then the second question I have on that is, and this is more qualitative I assume that, as the weather turned, and we maybe got this first wave of what maybe a more normal weather in a while, did the consumer react as you would expect or was there still \u2013 did you still see indications of maybe some hesitation as the consumer \u2013 as the weather turned?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Brian, this is Greg. I'll talk to consumer reaction here. Yes, December was the stronger of the three months in the quarter. No question. As the weather became more normalized, the consumer came back into the store spending in the categories that we would traditionally find them spending in \u2013 cold weather products, heating products, heating fuels and so on and so forth.", "We felt there was pent-up demand. And we found that clearly there was, and December proved that to be the case. So more normalized, I'm not sure what normal might be anymore because there's been so much fluctuation. But it was a good indication that our consumers were willing to spend with us and traffic our stores when that need or that demand was created.", "Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Okay.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "And, Brian, this is Kurt.", "Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "(58:09) follow-up...", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Brian, I was just going to reiterate that as we said December was the strongest and October-November weakest. And the comp sales were weakest in the beginning of the quarter, strongest in December. And that's about the detail we can give you on that.", "Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Got it. And then maybe a follow-up, Greg. During the (58:30) prepared comments, you talk a lot about \u2013 what I heard \u2013 I think I heard you say is that Tractor Supply did a much better job of being nimble around this weather and almost like localizing stores. How much different was that effort this year than it had been in prior years?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well, I think, we've been working this for a number of years. And I think Steve would tell you that there's never \u2013 and we haven't had two years the same in some time. I was making this comment earlier that it used to be we could pretty much pinpoint when fall would start, winter would start, spring would start, summer would start.", "Now the seasons continue to lap over and move around and such. And so we had to have a supply chain that was more nimble. So is it unusual the last year? I'd say, warm weather goods sold in the South and cold weather goods sold in the North. I mean, we've been able to work our assortments around that over time.", "And I think we've learned that the consumer is going to be driven by demand. So if it's warm outside, there's going to be certain demand for certain products. If it's cooler and colder, demand for other products. We're able to do that and address that today far better than we could in the past.", "Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks a lot, guys, for tons of detail. A lot of it's been answered and helpful. But I guess I just wanted to confirm. It sounds like you're reiterating that you feel comfortable with the mid-teens EPS guide long-term or a target. Is that the intention?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well, here's what I'm going to tell you. I think on a longer-term approach \u2013 we know that in the shorter term, due to some factors, we're going to be a little bit challenged to get back to that 3% to 5% comp and mid-teens EPS. But I do believe, with all the things that we're doing as a company and the things that we're seeing from our customer, we're still finding positive transaction counts. We're opening 100-plus stores on the TSC side, 30-some-odd stores on the Petsense side. We're expanding our digital footprint and then adding more and more capabilities there and that particular online business is growing exponentially to what we're seeing in the four wall.", "Mix of products. Steve talked about all the things that he's doing to renew the product mix and that's what drives our business. Neighbor's Club, bringing in the new CRM program. And also I could go on and on about all of the things that we're doing to enhance, improve and drive the business. So it is our belief that for the longer-term we should be able to get back to those 3% to 5% comps. And if it's not mid-teen EPS it's going to be at least double-digit EPS.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Understood. And just thinking about Petsense, I know you guys have framed it as relatively immaterial. Like, what is in the guide in terms of like EPS from Petsense? Is that something we should be modeling in or thinking about? And then if I could just sneak one in, I mean, the loyalty program sounds pretty exciting. If you could tell us how different traffic trends may be were in some of those markets versus the ones that have yet to get the program, that would be helpful too.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure. Stephen, it's Kurt. Petsense, net of the margin and the SG&A impact that we mentioned in our assumptions, I would say bottom line, they are not material to net income. They will not impact either favorably or unfavorably operating income.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "And Stephen, I would tell you, on the loyalty program or Neighbor's Club as we call it, again, it's still fairly confined. We just rolled out another couple hundred stores. So we're up to 600 stores now total. A couple of tidbits that I will share with you and that is, membership rate is growing. As Greg said, it's exceeding our expectation. Here, very shortly, we will exceed 1 million members to the program. I thought I would share that with you all. That'll be our first milestone on route to many more millions.", "The exciting thing about the program is that 80% of the folks that are signed up for the program, they are new to our email database. So you can only imagine the amount of communication now that we're able to do, that we didn't have prior to before. Greg talked about the click-throughs and the redemption rates and everything else being higher, and it really giving us an opportunity to personalize our communication.", "What I will say is, is until we scale and we cycle a full year, traffic count and some of the other metrics we're a little hesitant to go too much detail there, because I don't know if some of that's weather, because we're doing this geographically, or not. And so, rather than trying to confuse matters, I would just ask that that you understand that we wouldn't be rolling it out if we didn't think there was a lot of opportunity in front of us. So I'll leave you with that.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Sure. All right. Thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Go ahead, please.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just wanted to make sure, I know, we spent a lot on the kind of the long term outlook algorithms, so just really a housekeeping item. Are you guys going to update your thoughts on the long term ranges at the Analyst Day?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. Scott, this is Kurt. We'll certainly address our long-term outlook at Analyst Day. At this point I expect to provide more details and reaffirm what our expectations are for 2017, and then give some short-term plans as well as what we expect it takes to get to those long-term target range. So at this point, we are not changing, but reaffirming our long-term guidance.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. But it will be a topic of discussion at the Analyst Day?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, great. Then my second question is, in regards to overlap with your merchandising online, what do you think the percentage of what you guys sell is available online, and then where do you think your price vis-\u00e0-vis online with whatever's available?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Scott this is Steve. We spend a lot of time looking at what's happening out there in the digital space, and we're not so na\u00efve as if you read any of the headlines to realize that there's intrusion of online in a lot of brick-and-mortar.", "That said, we have done a few things here to do our best to insulate ourselves and we think that the model itself is somewhat unique. One, it's the customers that we cater to. Two, it's the stuff we have inside the box such as big bag feed, things that are very difficult to ship that last mile where there's not a lot of margin in it. And Tractor Supply plays in a lot of that space. A third of our business is also in exclusive brands, and it's one of the things we've worked really hard at just to develop those brands, so our customers know they can only come to us to get it.", "Now, there are alike products, I think with any brick-and-mortar that you're going to find online. So a shirt's a shirt and you can buy a shirt, depends on what you want and what brand you want and what you're willing to pay for it.", "In terms of pricing, I would say that we're relatively competitive. And we're not seeing any erosion in the categories that I would be the most concerned with in terms of driving C.U.E. products. And we've talked about that at the opening here.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, great. That's it for me, and then obviously congratulations to both Tony and Kurt. See you guys...", "Anthony F. Crudele - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thanks, Scott.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "...on the 21st.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Incorporated.", "Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.", "Yeah thanks, good afternoon. Steve, you had alluded to some of the additions you guys are making in your private label in the feed category on DuMOR and 4Health. I'm curious as you look at the broader livestock and pet category as a percentage of sales, where do you think we are in that timeline of penetration on the overall business?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "It's an interesting question. I've been fortunate enough to be with the company for \u2013 this is my 19th year, and I think we've probably been asked that question for 17 of the 19 and it's the last 17, we've been asked. Every year I go back to this. I do believe there's still long-term potential for us. For a couple of reasons: one, we are a consolidator in the markets that we go into and the markets that we serve. And talking to a lot of our key suppliers that are in the livestock feed business, they would tell you that there's a lot of generational transfer happening right now, and that we continue to pick up market share in the markets we serve. And I think that's one thing that makes us very unique.", "I would also tell you that we don't own 100% of the market in things like pet food or pet supplies. As a matter of fact, we own a very small portion of the overall total that's being sold out there right now. So I still believe there's upside and opportunity there. And as we continue to expand and grow our 4Health business and it becomes a bigger and bigger portion of our overall total, it continues to insulate us and adds value to those folks, quite frankly, that live the azure (01:07:50) lifestyle. So I still see upside and I still see momentum. Those are just two of the categories and there's plenty of other C.U.E. categories that do make us very unique that we are continuing to drive share in.", "Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.", "That's great. And then, Greg, I think in your opening comments you made some commentary on the drop ship program, extending additional products to that program, Buy Online Pickup in Store, could you just provide a little bit of even if it's anecdotal, some of the progress that you're seeing in those initiatives?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, I'll take that one. This is Steve again. I would tell you that we're looking at the digital space as a real opportunity for Tractor. I know there's a lot of folks out there that are trying to find defense to what's happening. And I would tell you, there's good reason for many of them, including Tractor to be constantly looking over our shoulder and building our own business. We've made great strides, I think, in the digital space over the last couple of years, but we still have more opportunity and more momentum.", "In terms of things like Buy Online and Pickup in Store, we rolled that out last fall. And we are now in 900 stores, and I would tell you that we had no national marketing. The only marketing we've done is on our website and in the inside of our stores. And our customers have responded very favorably. And they're using this now, this tool, and I think that it sets us apart from a lot of other farm and ranch chains. And we continue to see that as a growth opportunity. And by mid next year or mid this year, I should say, we will have that fully functional, chain-wide. And we'll be able to really do a blast nationally.", "The other thing I would tell you is that our customers use our site for a variety of reasons, and our web visits this last year were up 20%, which is exciting. And the other exciting thing is our store locator activity was up over 20%. So not only are customers finding us through the site, but there are actually many new customers using that store locator to come into our brick-and-mortar space.", "Our sales online continue to grow. While they're still less than 1% of our sales, we're very encouraged with the growth rate that we're seeing. We doubled the amount of drop ship vendors we had from year over year. We've got 75,000 plus SKUs now that you have access to online compared to about 15,000 to 20,000 inside the store. And what's also exciting is about half of our sales online are from products that you can't find in one of our stores. So we see that as a growth opportunity for incremental comp store sales as we continue to expand that out.", "So that's kind of an overview and an update, and I would tell you that our customers are responding very favorably to what we have to offer them.", "Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.", "Thanks so much and best of luck.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Good afternoon, everyone.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Hey, Chuck.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Hi, Chuck.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "In looking at the item you mentioned about acquisition costs in the fourth quarter, is that worth breaking out? Can you give us what that was?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. Chuck, I think, Tony mentioned that in his script at for the fourth quarter it's about $2.5 million pre-tax in there. There was other costs that were absorbed prior to the fourth quarter, but that was your Q4 impact.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "All right. Great. Now, switching to store openings, Greg, you mentioned that sometimes it's just difficult to get the number of people to man the stores when they open. Do you have that same problem or anticipate it, as the Petsense stores open? And is this going to be an ongoing sharing of the ability to get a full complement of Tractor Supply stores opened alongside of the Petsense units?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Chuck, I think, you misunderstood me. We do not have a problem finding capable people and training them to get the stores open. So my apologies, if you misheard that. What I said was that we could open up to 120 Tractor Supplys because we have a pipeline of people to do that.", "I'd also tell you that in the Petsense side of the business, now that I've spent some time with Steve Neibergall and the team, they also have a fairly robust, I'll call it, supply chain of people in the works. Petsense is a much smaller staffed store than Tractor Supply.", "So it's not as demanding on finding the number of heads of people, but no different than Tractor Supply. They are being very careful and making sure that they put qualified, well-trained store managers into those stores, as they ramp their growth.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Okay. Thank you on that. Steve, what are some of the outdoor sports SKUs you might be expanding into this year?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. Great comment. We expanded our ammo program in Q4 to up to 200 stores now, and we're still trying to get a good read on it. I say that because we had some in stock issues during the third quarter on that program. So it's hard to get a good measurement on it. I can tell you, even though we had some challenges there, we still think that there is a potential there for further expansion.", "Anything that has to do with kayaks, fishing kayaks, unique differentiated kayaks. Things around deer feeding and watching, all those categories seem to be performing very well for us.", "Now that said, there are some categories in the program today haven't performed and we'll be continuing to cull those out. I think we've got three or four different outdoor sports tests going on right now across the country to try to find which tests seem to make the most sense for us as we move forward. And we're going to watch it very closely and continue to evolve and refine that program as we move forward.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Alan Rifkin with BTIG.", "Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC", "Thank you. So with respect at your expansion of 100 stores in 2017, I was wondering if relative as you look to the expansion in the West, is there a disproportionate number of the 100 new stores in 2017 coming in the West compared to where we were in 2016. And if that is the case, is that having any effect as to why your EBIT margins will delever by 25 basis points to 40 basis points? Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Alan, the answer is no. It's a very well-balanced portfolio of stores across. The only reason we had a little bit of disproportionate openings in the West a few years ago was to get that distribution center up, and we needed about 125 stores minimum. And now that that was completed, no, it's a good, balanced mix across.", "Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC", "Okay. And my follow-up, if I may Greg, so it appears if you look at your trends over the last couple of years that your store is in the oil patch community came back quicker. There was less of a lag period from when oil has rebounded versus when oil was sinking and you kind of held in there with your comps better. What would be your best guess as to why that anomaly is apparently so?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well there's a number of things that happened in the oil patch. It's not just the fact that people are working or not working, there's also other things that affect this consumer that lives this lifestyle. For example, most of them have a large animal. Some of them have cattle. Things like that that get affected when their loss of income or lowered income comes into play, and so, they seem to either sell off the cattle and they'll have less need for certain products that we sell them, or the fact that they had certain projects they were going to do like a large fencing project, and that didn't materialize because guess what, didn't have the extra cash.", "So my comment on that is, I can't say that they bounced back any faster. I would say that it's been very slow so far from what we're seeing in the energy markets. And we just have to kind of wait and see.", "Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC", "Okay, thank you very much. Tony, best of luck to you in the future.", "Anthony F. Crudele - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next to Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Thanks a lot, and good evening. My question is around ticket versus traffic in 2017. I apologize if I had missed any comments here, but when you look at the comp guidance of 2% to 3%, how much of that is traffic versus ticket?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, this is Steve. I'll start. I would tell you that if you looked over the last several years, what's driven our comps is more traffic than it has been ticket. And while we're making an effort to try to gain the other side of the ledger of the ticket side, as I mentioned earlier, more sales around some of the bigger than average ticket, I would still tell you that traffic has been one of those things that Tractor Supply's been very fortunate with. And that's if you look at the C.U.E. categories, the strategy around a lot of that that's what's driven it. So if you're asking me and I was laying out what next year would look like, I would say, I'd lean on traffic more than I would on ticket.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Got it, but overall, thinking about it, you had a little bit less deflation forecasted, and I assume you're thinking big ticket won't be as big a drag. So does that suggest that you could see a positive contribution to comp ticket in 2017?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "That would be fantastic. If you could make that happen for us, I would support that. I would be uncomfortable telling you, I think, that that's what would happen just based on what the history has done. It's not that we've given up on ticket or average ticket, there is still some headwind there. But I will tell you that I feel traffic is one of the things that we continue to see. And I think a lot of what we're doing with Neighbor's Club and Buy Online Pickup in Store is continuing to drive that. So, again, I wouldn't give up on ticket or average ticket, and if it happens, fantastic, we are going to put a strategy around driving it. But I still would lean more toward the traffic side of the ledger.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thanks and my follow up is just around marketing. Can you talk about your marketing mix, how that shifted and any significant changes that you're planning for 2017?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "In Q4, one of the things that we've really been transitioning to is taking what has been traditional marketing and moving it into the digital space. We still recognize that our customers use newspapers, and they still view things the old way so to speak. So we've been slow to transition, but we are transitioning. In Q4 specifically, we did increase distribution in a couple of our circulars, and I think Greg had mentioned slightly more promotional but what we were able to do was get more of exposure out there for the circulars that we did do.", "As you look into 2017, I think, you'll continue to see an evolution of where we're putting our marketing dollars. We'll be spending more of those dollars on things that are more digital. We will be taking advantage of our Neighbor's Club program, as we continue to scale that out and talking to our consumers.", "And we'll continue to evolve based on what they're wanting from us, and we can measure that through the response rates in a lot of what we do. So we've always said the customer drives where we go. And in this case, we are going to get in the backseat and let them take us for a ride.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Very good. Thanks a lot, guys, and good luck.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Adam Sindler from Deutsche Bank.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "All right. Very good. Thank you so much. Tony, my congratulations as well, enjoy the time off. Greg, I'm really glad you brought up the deflation point because I do think that is important. And I wanted to go back maybe to some discussion around deflation coming out of 2015 as long ago as that was.", "I think back then we were seeing some waning deflation mostly in seed and lubricants. Steel was becoming less of an impact. And then we started to see better trends into this year, and then things turned pretty sharply in the third quarter. What was it specifically that turned negatively and sort of against maybe expectations? And then what should we maybe be looking for going forward to see if we could ever get back to an inflationary environment?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well, one of the biggest things was two things \u2013 the oil category going one direction and seed or bird going in another direction. Both categories where we sell tremendous amount of tonnage of product. What can change that, as we go forward, we always like to have a little bit of inflation pushing our sales. And a little bit of inflation is a good thing for the business.", "Unfortunately, it's been a mixed bag. And again we have to deal with that. We have to manage through that. Adam, it's not been easy. But I'd like to see a little inflation this next year maybe as we get toward the end of the year into 2018, but I can't predict that. Right now, it looks a little bit like we're still going to see some deflation for a while.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then, in that regard, does the mix of private label impact that at all or is this just deflation sort of on a pure product cost? I mean, my example, I guess, would be private label is \u2013 not always in your case specifically but often more lower priced. As you mix more to private label, is that impacting deflation or is that just more on the comp ticket?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "I think Steve can answer that.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. I would say that when we talk private label, we talk private label across all the brands that we have in our stores. So some of them are related to more commodity-based products and some of them aren't. So I want to make that point clear first.", "I would tell you that if you look at the drivers of deflation or inflation, like you said, it's steel, it's corn, and it's lubricating or petroleum-based products. But we keep a close eye on all of those. As we grow some of our exclusive brands and take share, it's a balance and it's a mix. So I don't necessarily think that it's a deflation necessarily driven solely from that, and that's what I would leave you with. I don't know if I confused you more or not.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "No, that's perfect. One follow-up on the average ticket question. As you look to the back half of this year, the average ticket was down on down from the year before and close to down 3 points on the fourth quarter on a two-year stack. I mean, I understand for the year you're probably not going to get positive ticket. But would you expect that by that fourth quarter ticket starts to turn positive especially with sort of the expectation of waning deflation by the fourth quarter?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well, again, there's the difference between big ticket and the big ticket impact on average ticket. And so, the two of them play together. The only thing I can tell you about big ticket is that things like log splitters and stoves and some heating products, we didn't see much benefit from in October and November. There was a pretty significant headwind there. As it got colder, we started to sell more of that type of product.", "As you look to next year, again, I don't want to say that it's all weather-driven, we are doing a lot of things within the assortments that we have ourselves, but there is a factor there. So if you look year-to-year, you're right, we've had two Q4s that showed big ticket off than average ticket. We're doing everything in our end to try to keep that number up. But, again, customers are going to buy what they need. And we've always said we're a needs-based retailer.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Excellent. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time, I'll turn the conference back over to your speakers.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Okay. Thank you everyone for your continued support and interest in Tractor Supply.

On the call with me today are Steve Barbarick, our President, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Kurt Barton, our Chief Financial Officer.", "As was previously disclosed in our business update on April 11, a challenging weather played a significant role in our first quarter results, with a very mild January and February and cooler spring temperatures throughout most of March accompanied by March winter storms. The demand for both winter and spring seasonal products was clearly diminished for the quarter. In the markets where weather and sales were more favorable, we pulled forward several spring seasonal receipts, and where weather was less favorable, we acted aggressively addressing excessive winter product, which by quarter end resulted in a clean transition to spring.", "In April, the weather has turned more spring-like and our consumers are responding positively to our assortments and sales have improved. We know from our many years of experience, the spring sales can shift between the first quarter and second quarters and that is why we have consistently stated that our financial performance can be best accurately assessed, by the halves and not by the individual quarter's business.", "Looking ahead, we understand that the retail landscape is changing rapidly, and our customers' expectations are evolving as well. Having the right products in stock at the right time and having those products competitively priced and readily available, whether in-store or online is what our customers expect. The shopping experience across all Tractor Supply shopping channels must be seamless, effortless and consistent. And by adding a level of exceptional customer service, we can meet their needs better than any of our competition.", "With this, evolving landscape in mind, we are making strategic investments throughout the organization to meet the ever-evolving expectations of our customer and further enhance our personal relationship with them. Here are a few of the strategic initiatives that we will believe will enable us to address the current challenges we face within our business and will be instrumental in driving comparable store sales in the future.", "The first is our customer loyalty program, Neighbor's Club. This was rolled out to all stores as of early April and has 1.5 million members to-date. This program is growing rapidly and has exceeded our original expectations. We are very excited about this program and believe it will become a valuable tool to strengthen that relationship with our customers. Now, we've got a complete picture of the customer shopping history, and that will allow Tractor Supply to gain deeper insights into our customers buying habits and provide us with the ability for more targeted messaging to them.", "As we leverage our digital communications, we will better inform our customers regarding new products or upcoming events that are of interest to them. While we are still gathering data for the entire chain of stores, initial results from the pilot stores have shown that our Neighbor's Club members shop our stores twice as often as Neighbor's Club non-members, and their average spend is notably higher than non-Neighbor's Club members.", "The second initiative; we're very excited about and have seen great initial customer response for, is our Buy Online Pickup in Store Program. This program is currently rolling out to the entire chain and will be complete by mid-May. We know our customers value, a number of things, high-quality products, product availability, a quick and easy shopping experience and most of all, great customer service.", "The Buy Online Pickup in Store Program allows our customers great flexibility and added convenience as they shop with Tractor Supply. They can place an order online, be assured the product is there at the store and pick up that order the same day. And while they are there on our store receive seasoned advice on other products and services that we offer. They no longer have to wait for package to arrive at their home and they don't have the hassle of shipping something back should they need to return it. Our stores are very close to where they live and we'll gladly take the return.", "Since the rollout, a significant amount of our e-commerce business growth can be attributed to Buy Online Pickup in Store, and we are founding that these transactions carry a higher average order value and many customers are adding purchases to their cart when picking up their online orders in our stores.", "And finally, with our supply chain, our largest initiative this year is the construction of our new distribution center in the State of New York, which is expected to be completed by the middle of 2018 and shipping products by the end of 2018. This new distribution center will add the necessary capacity for further store expansion in the Northeast Corridor and will also support our expanding digital fulfillment strategy and move us closer to our goal of reaching 90% of the U.S. population within 2 shipping days.", "So, in summary, we know our business performance has been a bit choppy over the past year and we know that the retail environment is rapidly evolving. We have a plan and we are executing to that plan to realize our long-term target of high single-digit annual sales growth. Some of the tailwinds to the business over the past several years, such as the C.U.E. expansion, some of the big ticket sales, some of the benefit of the oil and gas markets and the impacts of inflation have either slowed or become headwinds today. We know it's our responsibility to address those shifts and find ways to move the business forward. We have a strong and proven business model that serves a unique customer with specific needs.", "With our size, scale, store count and growing digital capabilities, we believe there is no other farm store retailer that can serve this customer the way we can. We are confident, we are investing in the areas that will drive sustainable long-term growth, but we cannot guarantee that this growth will always be on a smooth and linear path. We will, however, continue to be as transparent as possible about our business and will keep you updated on our initiatives and their progress.", "As always I want to thank all of our dedicated Tractor Supply team members who give great customer service every day to all our customers and the other frontline of our business. A big thank you to everyone for all you do in our stores, Merchandise Innovation Center, distribution facilities, and our Store Support Center. I still believe you are the best team in retail.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kurt Barton, who will take you through the first quarter results in more detail.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended April 1, 2017, on a consolidated year-over-year basis, net sales were $1.56 billion, resulting in net income of $60.3 million and earnings per share of $0.46 per diluted share. Comparable store sales decreased 2.2% versus a reported increase of 4.9% last year.", "As a reminder, our Q1 2017 comparable store results reflect the calendar shift associated with the 53rd week in 2016. Adjusting for the week shift, last year's comparable store sales increase would have been 2.6%. As we indicated in our last earnings call, we anticipated Q1 to be a challenging sales quarter. If you recall the first quarter last year benefited from very cold weather in January, which drove the sale of winter related items. Q1 of last year also benefited from both warm March temperatures and an early Easter, which drove sales of early spring merchandise.", "Unfortunately, we experienced a complete opposite situation in first quarter 2017. In this year's first quarter, January and February weather was very warm, and we then had cooler temperatures and snow in March. January and February's warmer than normal conditions of this year impacted demand for winter seasonal products. Additionally, the March winter storms, which primarily hit the Midwest and Northeast, but also reached down into parts of the Southern regions quickly silenced any early demand for spring seasonal products. The impact on comp sales from softness in seasonal products was relatively equal between winter and spring seasonal goods.", "Sales were weakest in the Northern regions of the country where the impact of weather was most pronounced, both in winter and spring seasonal products. The Southern regions were less impacted by the weather conditions, but we're cycling a tough compare from last year's strong performance. The difference in comp sales performance between the Northern and Southern regions, excluding the Western region was approximately 600 basis points. The Western region which experienced less weather volatility had a solid mid single-digit comp sales growth. We continue to see strength in the Western region as we expand our store base and gain market awareness and share.", "We continue to experience increased demand for many of our basic everyday items, such as our livestock and pet category, which generated low single-digit comparable chain-wide sales. Excluding the impact of certain weather influenced categories, such as bird feeding, animal health and fencing, we continue to be pleased with the overall performance of this category. While there is a seasonal component to the livestock and pet category, we were pleased with the continued increase in comp units and sales dollars in the pet food and animal feed categories. And we see no evidence that we are losing market share in this core area of the business.", "Comp transaction count decreased 1.4% compared to a reported 4.2% increase last year or 2.6% in the prior year adjusted for the week shift. The growth in many of our C.U.E. items such as pet and animal food was more than offset by the lack of demand in winter seasonal products such as heating units and insulated outerwear and spring seasonal products such as lawn and garden, animal health and ag chemicals. The average ticket decreased by approximately 90 basis points.", "Big ticket sales declined and deflation were the two primary drivers of this quarter's average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items were down high single-digits year-over-year. The comparable sales decline of big ticket items was primarily driven by a slower start to spring seasonal products such as riding lawn mowers, 3-point equipment and trailers, as well as continued softness in the safe business. Deflation was slightly higher than we anticipated at approximately 50 basis points, driven principally by heating fuel, bird feed, livestock feed and lubricant categories.", "As Greg stated, the weather shifted to more typical spring conditions in early April. And as a result, we have seen consumer demand increase. Also as a reminder, Petsense store sales are not reflected in same-store sales, as those will fall into the store base, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017.", "Now turning to gross margin, which decreased 60 basis points to 33.1%, compared to a 30 basis point increase in the prior year. In certain cold weather seasonal products where there was limited demand, we increased markdowns to ensure that we ended the season in a clean inventory position. Additionally, we were slightly more promotional in our efforts to drive sales by creating value for our customer. Freight negatively impacted gross margin, principally due to a greater mix of freight intensive categories, growth in our e-commerce business and to a lesser extent, higher average fuel costs.", "The mix of merchandise had a slightly negative impact on gross margin. This was driven by the strength of sales in C.U.E. product, specifically animal and pet food, which are below chain average margin categories. Petsense provided a benefit to gross margin as they produced a higher rate than Tractor Supply stores. Also, it should be noted that last year in the first quarter margin benefited approximately 15 basis points from vendor support programs associated with the initial stocking of our new Arizona DC.", "For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization deleveraged by 70 basis points to 27% of sales compared to 26.3% of sales in the prior year's quarter. The primary driver of the deleverage was the decline in comparable store sales. A few other factors impacting SG&A ratio were Petsense, which operates at a higher SG&A rate and a greater investment in store payroll hours as part of our focus on enhancing the customer experience. And then as a partial offset to the deleverage, we estimate that incentive compensation provided approximately 35 basis points of year-over-year leverage.", "Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was 35.6% compared to 36.8% last year. The reduction in rate is principally due to the favorable impact of the adoption of the new accounting rules related to the recognition of incremental tax benefit on stock option exercises. The impact is typically strongest in the first quarter due to the timing of equity vesting and a smaller income base in Q1. And thus, we do not expect similar benefit in future quarters. We continue to estimate our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 36.2% to 36.4%.", "Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had a cash balance of $73 million and $611 million outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $75 million and $250 million outstanding debt last year. During the first quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired 1.6 million shares for $115 million. The consolidated average inventory per store decline of 3.4% reflects the impact of Petsense stores on the chain average. Exclusive of Petsense average inventory levels per store increased 4.2%, principally due to the timing of our spring seasonal build and to some extent, the timing of seasonal sales.", "With respect to our outlook, we are not updating our guidance at this time, as we have said for many years, we know that weather can impact the timing of sales this time of the year and we believe it's best to evaluate our performance based on the halves rather than the quarters. While our Q1 performance was disappointing, there is still a lot of business ahead of us in the spring summer season, therefore we believe, it is prudent to revisit our guidance at the end of the second quarter.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you Our first question comes from Peter Benedict from Robert Baird.", "Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I'll use my one on some of the online stuff. Thanks for some of the color on BOPIS. Any more metrics around kind of just how online sales \u2013 I know it's a small number for your guys, but how it's been growing, what percentage of the business it is? And then what else are you working on beyond Buy Online Pickup in Store, those types of things in order to better position the company for omnichannel selling in the years ahead? Thank you.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Peter, this is Steve Barbarick. And I would tell you, we've made a lot of advancements over the last couple of years and we continue to make traction as we go forward. To give you some bullets into the quarter and what we saw, our web visits were up about 26%. And what's also very exciting is that, if you look at the number of hits we've got the store locator, we had nearly 5 million hits to store locator for the quarter, which is up about 40%. So we know our customers are going online, they're not just looking at content or looking to buy, but also to look where our stores are located.", "Couple of other tit bits here that I would share with you. Our mobile traffic was over 60% and up to last year, and we continue to see Drop Ship as a real viable source for us. If you combine what we've done now direct-to-customer, as well as what we're seeing with Buy Online Pickup in Store, the early results, I will tell you, as we move into the back half of this year, I suspect for the full year we will be between probably 1% and 2% of sales, so we're seeing nice growth there.", "Then if you look at some of what we're doing in terms of capabilities, as Greg said, evolve to what customers needs, we talk a lot internally, and I think, we introduced this to you all at the Investor Meeting this concept of ONETractor. And it's really making sure we're taking the care of the customer anytime, anywhere and anyway. And we're working on things like enhanced search, enhanced checkout. We've got a comprehensive pricing tool that's going on out there for us, we can look at what the competitors are doing, even going as far as taking a look at what we're doing inside the stores to better take care of our customers, when it comes to Buy Online Pickup in Store.", "So there is a lot of things and a lot of capabilities that we have that we're working on and that also includes what we call the stockyard, which is a special order system in a number of our stores right now. So I guess, what I would tell you is that we're not sitting back, we're moving forward and we've got a plan to do just that. I know that was a long answer, but I wanted to make sure that I was comprehensive as I could be.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess, I'll focus a little bit on the weather and ask the question \u2013 two part question. The first one is the West Coast mid-single digit comp pretty outstanding. I know that that region has been out-comping the rest of the store base for a while now. Can you just kind of remind us the spread between how the West has been performing versus the rest of the chain? And then, as the weather did improve, did all product categories improve in line with how you would expect, meaning do you see any area, Steve, specifically a weakness from a merchandising perspective that maybe you could do better in? Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "This is Greg. I'll start off and I think Kurt and Steve may join. First of all, the Western region, as you know, we had a little bit of a slow start there in one state, but once the consumer recognized and understood who we were, we started seeing business accelerate. We don't typically comment on the basis points difference between West, East, North and South, so I'll kind of pun on that one. What I can tell you is that the West is doing quite well. I think there has been a real challenge in the retail environment in general, but our Western stores are performing very, very well. Now, there is more new stores in the West so \u2013 and I needed to make sure that you understand that caveat.", "I think they're less weather dependent as well, so that gives us a little bit of a benefit, and there's some things we're learning about the West, not only through the digital capabilities that we're also rolling out there, but how this consumer \u2013 their consumption, it's a large recline community. And I think for us, it's a little bit like the Deep South in Texas. We've got a consumer base out there that needs us, wants us to be there and they're engaging with us at a very high level. So, you'll see us continue to expand in the West eventually maybe talking about more distribution capability toward maybe the Seattle area at some point.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. And I would just add Matt that talking about the seasonal shift here, Greg talked earlier and so did Kurt about the softness we saw in January and February, and that really impacted a lot of our cold weather businesses. It was exciting and we thought we get into early spring and so we were quite nimble, we brought some receipts in early, and thought that we could capitalize on an early spring season similar to last year, but then the weather turned on us. Once we got into April, you would get, basically what you would expect. We saw the OPE lines start to ramp-up, a lot of our spring seasonal businesses take off, as well including grass seed. Now, we do have one less day in the second quarter, and that already took place in April. But if you look across the board, it's pretty much shaping up like you would expect for a spring season.", "Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.", "Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thanks. And Steve also kind of follow-up on that question with two parts. When you talk about April looking like a typical spring season, does that also imply it's back in that range plus 2% to plus 3%, that you're guiding for fiscal year 2017 or is it just an improvement from the minus 2% that we had in the first quarter?", "And then the other question, I want to see if you could answer, is on the original gross margin guidance of 25 basis points to 40 basis points for this year. I knew that the pricing optimization was part of the other margin driver that you're expecting. Do you think it's still a good environment to be pushing higher pricing in submarkets given the tepid demand?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Dan, this will be a two part answer, because I'll take a piece and Steve will take a piece. On the April trend moving forward, the only thing I can tell you is you said it, not me, yes we are in the range of where we forecasted for the year.", "Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "And we're pleased with the initial response, but it's early. We are only 2.5 weeks in, but as we said before when you see what is shift, it can have a dramatic impact on some of these categories in our business. Steve, you want to talk about gross margin?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. I would just say that, Dan, we always talk about rate and share and there is a balance between the two. We are certainly not going to do anything that would put us in a position to be uncompetitive. So when you use a pricing tool and you've got upwards of 15,000 SKUs in the store, not all of them have the same level of elasticity. So we're going through \u2013 we're going to be very careful, very surgical in the way we use the tool. I would say at this point the tool is not cost us any share, if anything it's benefited us both ways, because we have come down on some prices and up on others and we will be very methodical on the use of that.", "Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Petsense in terms of, is it meeting expectations, could you carve out what its sales might be approximately for the quarter? And then where in New York will that new distribution center be and when might it open? Thanks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Okay. Well, that was about five questions and one there, Chuck. So I'll start off with Petsense. Very pleased with how the Petsense business is performing. As I said 2017 is a year of kind of the shakedown to understand the business more fully and to look at the expansion opportunities. So, we still think this is a company that has tremendous store count, as well as online and Buy Online Pickup in Store capabilities, which we'll talk more about as we get further into the year. But Petsense is a winner, we're very excited about it and it's teaching us a few things about pet special that we can use also in Tractor. What else?", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "DC.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "DCs. DC is going to be, I think we've already made that announcement...", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yes.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Official, it's in Herkimer, New York. Frankfurt \u2013 Herkimer it's in that area, it's in that area, it's kind of a small town in Northern part of New York \u2013 but Northwestern New York. But the location was chosen because of its importance to helping us broaden our expansion capabilities as we add more stores into North. As you may know, and we talked about this a few calls back that we needed more capacity in the Northeast. The Hagerstown facilities and there are two of them are somewhat running at maximum. That facility will be fully functional at the end of 2018. So, don't expect us to \u2013 we'll start adding some stores in 2018 there, but 2018 into 2019 will be the final build outs as we move forward on for store base there.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Any numbers you could give us on what Petsense contributed to sales in the first quarter?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "We don't really break it out separately, and honestly Chuck, we don't do that for competitive reasons. So, as it grows to be a larger percentage, we'll talk more about that maybe later in the year first to next.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "All right. Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.", "Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray", "Hey, thanks for taking the question.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure.", "Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray", "Greg, I was wondering if you could comment, in the press release and in your prepared remarks, you referenced multiple times that retail landscape is changing rapidly. Could you provide maybe a little bit more perspective on that with the specifics and I assume it may be related to e-comm, but maybe you can enhance the detail?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Okay. A couple of things that I would say to that, Peter, one is that we noticed in our own business about four years ago \u2013 four-and-a-half years ago, the amount of consumers that were coming to us through mobile devices, and we kept scratching our heads, on why is mobile so important. Well, as we talked about as a group and we went out with visiting stores, it's very simple. The landscape change, because that's the way our customer in the real community can communicate with us and that's how they really find product online. We see there's not a lot of broadband in a lot of these markets where we have stores. So, cell towers are easy and for them to use mobile was important, so we quickly started to mobilize everything that we do.", "The second thing we were learning is Buy Online Pickup in Store made a lot of sense to us as step one, versus that fulfillment, which we're already doing to Drop Ship and such through our Franklin facility and with a lot of vendor base that we have out there. But we said, our customers buy projects generally and they come in, they want to know that the product is there before they make the trip. Remember, they're traveling on average of 10 miles to 15 miles to get to our stores usually.", "So when we turned it on, we thought let's just watch and see and exactly what we thought was going to happen has happened and that was last fall, well I'm proud to say we've got to roll the entire chain in less than an eight-month period and it is driving our online business. It's also bringing customers in to four wall. And as I said in my comments, these customers are adding other things to the ticket. So, the ticket is starting to grow when it comes to Buy Online Pickup in Store. And then, eventually we'll start to look at how we fulfill directly to consumers, as Steve and the team build out the network with the distribution centers, and we can start shipping direct, and not having to trying to fulfill out of one center.", "Now, the other thing that's changing in retail is you have to be available to the customer 24/7. It doesn't matter what time you open and close the physical store. The store is opened 24/7, and we realized that about four years ago, maybe even longer, and we've been working, and that's why we did to the replatforming, and I'm very excited about now our capabilities. And Rob's team has really brought us in very, very quickly and up to speed, and we're moving much, much faster than those in our segment. And having the capabilities of Buy Online Pickup in Store, direct fulfillment from a distribution centers and Drop Ship, being able to have mobile POS in our stores, we're testing right now, rolling out to more stores. What we like about that is, it gives us the ability to ring a sale to correct inventory, to answer a phone call, to do whatever, with one device throughout the entire store, it can even be a line buster, if we get a line of people, that can go in and use that device to basically ring the customers up. So, that's a wonderful tool, and the stores that are using it today are loving it. And I think we just about got a tool to the point, we're going to take it role to chain.", "And then the last thing is, the comment that Steve made about stockyard. And that's really the special order concept. It's really a kiosk that sits back at the customer service desk. It's a large screen, it's there for the customer. And what we're finding, customers are going there to place special orders, maybe large quantities of product that we already carry but, don't have enough in the store or a unique product that they can't find, but they can go on the screen with the help from one of our team members and we don't lose the sale.", "I'll give you an example. If we run an ad on Wednesday and Wednesday it breaks and Thursday, we sell out of an item, in the past, we'd have to tell a customer, we can give you a rain check, we don't have to do that any longer. Now we can say, listen just go to the kiosk, we'll go ahead and lock it in and that'll be coming to you in the next truck or will drop shipment to your premises. So all of these things are working in conjunction, and as Steve said before, it's ONETractor. So we've realized that, we have been moving very quickly over the last several years. We've probably just been more public with it over maybe the last six months to eight months. But we are clearly moving ahead of those in our segment and excited about what we see in front of us.", "Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Thanks. That's a great detail. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.", "Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thanks for taking the question. My question is around the promotional activity you discussed. Can you just elaborate on that, and whether you think, it was effective? And then the second part of the question, sort of ties in just around deflation, which has been a drag. Is that purely just flowing through the impact from lower input cost or is there any evidence that maybe it's getting a little bit more competitive in some of the consumable categories? Thanks.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Seth, this is Steve Barbarick. And one of the things, we talk a lot about is, I mentioned it earlier about our ability to be nimble, and whether it'd be using our inventory or using things like promotion to take care of our business and making sure that we continue to keep share up.", "In the first quarter, we did a few things. We did a coupon online to see what kind of impact that might have and we tested that across the network, and the response was very favorable with our customers. We also did a few other little events that we thought might have an impact. I would tell you that, it wasn't material in terms of overall sales to the business. It did have a little bit of a margin erosion, but we've always talked a little bit about the fact that, we've got to make sure that we're using all of the arrows in our quiver. This would be one of the arrows that we used in Q1. I don't anticipate further promotion needing to be used throughout the remainder of the year based on last year's promotion, but we want to make sure that we've reserved the right to use it, if we need to. So that's what I will would tell you about promotion.", "In terms of deflation and Kurt and I may tag team this one. Typically the way we view that is input cost first, and then what our retail selling price is second. So, what you hear when we talk about deflation isn't us just selling at lower retails, it has to do first and foremost with the impact of commodities.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. No, I will just say I agree, because Steve hit that important point, Seth in that, it's the input costs that are a key part to that. So, our deflation calculation is not quoting situations where there maybe retail declines without a cost change.", "Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Hi Simeon.", "Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, Guys.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Hey, Simeon.", "Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. So, I too have one question, but I'll make it part A and a part B. The part A, Greg I'd love to hear your thoughts on the private transaction in the Pets space last week, if \u2013 how you think about it, if you're expecting to see a more rational competitor, I'm not talking about the physical one, the digital one?", "And then my second question, and Greg, you mentioned there's been a lot of choppiness in the last year on comps, and the first quarter being no exception. We're kind of hearing from other retailers, we're hearing weather was a problem and then we're starting to see guidance that looks more normal for the second quarter. So given that the choppiness that you've seen, I guess, how do you get confidence in let's say, what a normalized run-rate looks like a 2%, 3% or 4%, and correct me if I'm wrong doesn't your comparison in this quarter you're in, doesn't it get tougher as the quarter goes on?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "All right. Let me first comment about \u2013 and let me not comment about the PetSmart Chewy scenario. All I can tell you there is that we keep our eyes and ears open to what's going on both online and in bricks-and-mortar. We think we have a powerful combination with Petsense and Tractor right now, and there is a lot of growth for us in Petsense to take that business digital and explode it. And in the local markets, where I can push from store delivery, it's going to be a huge advantage for us as we go forward. So, as far as the private transaction there, that's probably the only way that it could have happened, to be honest, because as a public company, I don't think that many people could have absorbed the hit in earnings.", "Moving on from that to the choppiness, and why do I feel, we've got a more normal looking setup for second quarter and maybe beyond, and yes, there's some challenges. Simeon, when you see the business respond as we had hoped in the early part of April that we didn't see happen in the first quarter, it gives us great confidence. We've been in this business, all of us, Steve's been here 19 years, I've been here 10 years, Kurt's been here 15-plus years, and the rest of the team, we're not rookies to this, we've seen this before. I can remember a year, when the weather didn't break until Memorial Day weekend, and we blew the numbers away for the entire year. It was just, we were off to the races and never looked back. So, I think we're a little less concerned now that we've seen the business open up, and it's more in line with what we had expected. But as I said before, this is not a linear path. We could see some coolness, some softness, but we really feel good about what we're seeing right now, and our inventory levels have really come down quickly because of the amount of sales that we generated in the first two-and-a-half weeks.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. Simeon, Kurt. A couple things on that. So we continue to evaluate our long-term targets, and as just a reminder, our long-term targets that we've set is high single-digit total sales growth, which include some solid comp store sales in that picture. To Greg's point, one quarter of tough weather conditions or a couple of quarters there are not going to change our long-term targets. We still see the strength in the business, and our sales growth driving initiative ability to drive the high single-digit sales growth. One reminder is, when it comes to Q2, I think as was mentioned, in Q2, we do have one less comp sales day, that we know is part of the headwind that we're facing as part of Q2.", "Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.", "Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi, good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Recognizing that you don't want to update your full year guidance until the second quarter, to get to the low-end of the your previous 2% to 3% comp guidance for the year, you will need to do at least 3% comp for the next few quarters. And over the last four years, you've averaged an annual comp of 3.4% and you've acknowledged that this number benefited from the expansion of few big ticket sales, growth in energy markets and the impact of deflation. So aside from deflation getting less bad, what is going to get better in order for you to consistently put you in the comp range that's necessary in order to hit your standing guidance?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Michael. First as we said, given the seasonality of the business and the weather conditions in first quarter, we're not updating guidance at this time. Reminding that first quarter is the lowest volume sales and earnings quarter for that, that's the primary reason, it's about 15% of sales and earnings for the year. So at this point with being so early in the year and we recognize those factors that you brought up, at this point, it's just too early to give any guidance on the year.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Let me comment on, what needs to get better, Michael, okay. First of all, it's top-line sales, it's the categories that we didn't see response from in March this year that we saw in March last year, and we're seeing that. We also believe that the acceleration of our business in the digital space is feeding and fueling some of the things happening in the four wall store.", "We are talking with our consumer 24/7, they are interacting with us 24/7. As we learn, we reapply, Neighbor's Club has been a tremendous benefit from the standpoint of understanding this consumer better and being able to talk to them directly. And we're just getting really to start using some of that information. And then, I will tell you, we said it earlier, BOPIS has really been a wonderful addition to the business. What I like about is, it gives us both sides, it gives us the online component, it gives us the four wall component, and all we see for that is just continued acceleration.", "So there's a number of things, even within some product categories that Steve didn't mention, but he could, the things that we're starting to see work far better in some categories that maybe were a little more difficult the past two years, they're starting to open up again. And the energy markets down in Texas seemed to have settled down now and we're starting to see the movement back in those markets in sales. So, there is a lot of positive things that we see going forward, and that's why I would guess to say at this point, it's best to looking us at the halves not the quarters.", "Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC", "And Greg, if I could just add one quick one? Because of the addition of Petsense, we can't calculate your new store productivity, what was your new store productivity in the first quarter and how does that compare to what it was last year?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure, Michael. I'll take that one. Yeah, there is a couple of unique factors in the new store productivity calculation I understand that, so I'll give you a little bit of data points on there. So the unique items are the week shift and the impact it has on this year, so the week shift into a higher spring sales week also long without Petsense impact the new store productivity when you're looking at it from the external data that you have. Internally, as we adjust it for those two items, the first quarter new store productivity was slightly below the prior quarter, but nothing significant in that decline and I'll just tell you that the new store performance continues to be in line with our pro forma calculations and those new stores continue to contribute at an elevated comp consistent as what we've seen in the prior year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Good afternoon. I guess maybe I wanted to focus on the GURA right, the service initiative you have going on, maybe if you just comment Greg on how that process is going, what metrics you're looking at to measure the impact on service levels and sales? And then how has the one quarter shortfall impacted your plans to invest in labor and service this year, if at all?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Couple of things, Steve, I'm going to talk about is GURA, and its greet, uncover, recommend and ask. Our scores are climbing in that category. I would take that if John Ordus was speaking he would tell you that there is still more work to be done, but we are seeing a comparison year-over-year in a very positive direction.", "The second thing I would tell you is that we're protecting payroll in our stores. We all believe, as a management team that you can't call out great service when you have no one in the store to wait on the customer and take care of their needs. And so, we are going to take the route of making sure the payroll is protected, and making sure our stores can service our customers and that could be painful at times, but we know that, that is the longer-term goal, is to keep that customer service level at an all time high. And our S&G scores, which is the company we used to measure that are very accurate today and are telling us that that is paying off. So we believe it'll payoff in sales, particularly as we get into the peak season here in second quarter. And you know what, we'll be able to update you more in July when we get through the second quarter.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I also wanted to ask a multipart question on the comp. I guess, part one would be sort of around the in store initiatives and whether there is any initial uplift when Neighbor's Club comes and whether the incremental self space and Pet is helping? And then part two would be sort of about, how to think about the deferred sales that you have to have from 1Q, do you think that comes in ratably throughout the quarter or is that more sort of an out of the gates types of a dynamic?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "So, let me start Stephen, this is Steve, with the in-store initiatives and some of the things that we're doing. We did reset about a 1,000 stores in first quarter, in those stores they got the reset, we went up to 84-inch height. And really, the strategic area of our business in that is Pet. And you heard Kurt, and I believe, Greg both talk about the growth of our Pet business in Q1. I think we're going to get the benefit of that later in the year, because that reset happened about midway toward the back half of Q1. So, that's still in play, but we anticipate continued growth there. We tested it before we did it, so we had an ROI before we laid it out.", "The other thing I would tell you in store is that we had our most successful Chick Days event ever when you crossover the March/April timeframe. It was fantastic. We saw great growth in a lot of the accessories within Chick Days, whether it'd be the coops organic feed and treats. The Garden event is doing exceptionally well right now. And so, a lot of the efforts that we put into the initiatives in store have really from where I sit have paid off. The seasonal business was a drag, and it's unfortunate because it doesn't necessarily reflect the hard work nor the results that I would have expected.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Stephen, Kurt, I'll address the second part of it. And it might be helpful as a data point to refer back to our pull forward discussion from last year. At the end our Q1, we estimated that number at about $18 million. And then, as we reported Q2 and saw the results in April more information settled we estimated at about $25 million. To have it more of a comparable number for this year, with the week shift in moving that week into Q1, but April shifting to Q2, our estimate is for this quarter, it was about a $15 million deferral into the second quarter. How that plays out in the second quarter, weather as well as Easter timing plays into it, so some of that there in the first part of April, but the rest of it really can play into just as the weather hits in various spots, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast. So I wouldn't say it's something that was immediate all in the first few weeks of April, it really plays more into the weather conditions in areas such as the North.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And then just Neighbor's Club, is there an early lift on that or is that really more about the long-term in the data that you're collecting?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Again, this is Steve. I would tell you that and I've said this previously that if we didn't think that there was a lift, we wouldn't have rolled it out completely. We haven't gone into specifics around what that lift looks like, but we do believe there is a benefit, less in the short-run, although there is a benefit and certainly more in the long haul.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Understood. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I had a short-term oriented question and then a longer one. First in, and I think you said that April is off to a good start. If you took a step back and looked at April and March combined, are you in positive territory or are you still negative, if you're going to kind of look at it that way, trying to even out some of the Easter shift in the weather?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yes, Scott. Good question. I can't speak too specific to \u2013 specifically to those particular months. We would just say again that, we saw the March potential dissipate with the cold weather. And then I would just tell you, we've seen strong response from the consumer as the weather has turned more typical in April. At this point, that's the best I can give you. Too early in the quarter to try to give more specifics.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Because Easter should have really helped you guys out quite a bit, isn't that correct?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well, keep in mind that Easter, we're closed on that day. So, we lose a day of sales, but certainly last year, we had the benefit of the Friday and Saturday before the Easter and we had that in April, so you do get those two days in April. And we have a strong add at that time that coincides as well. So, there is a planned expected strong sales performance in that particular time around Easter.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "And were you on plan?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "It's a good question. Scott, can't be any more specific.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. So, then I appreciate that. And then, so looking at a longer term question, I think it's something I've asked you guys before, but I want to kind of poke at it again. I mean, if I take a step back and just look at your same-store sales, yearly same-store sales, they really have been kind of down into the right since I think 2011. Each year, they're kind of peeling off just a little bit, and some years a little more, and I guess last year. What do you guys think is causing the kind of the slow decline? And obviously this year is not off to such a good start. I mean have you kind of pinpointed on what is a major drop from like I say mid-5% to now like last year 16%, what are the causes there and why do you think it will stop?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Okay. This is Greg, I'll give a comment. I think, Steve and Kurt also say. First of all, there were tailwinds. No question, there were few tailwinds helping us. Inflation is a good thing. A few categories that had some tailwinds behind it saves and a few other things of that nature, which goes slowly kind of work their way off, okay, out of the comparable sales numbers. I don't believe \u2013 because we track this very closely with competitive intrusion, and we don't believe that it is anything that we had done to not refresh the business or bring newness to the business. I do believe, however, that the entire four wall retail businesses around the country and many segments have seen some decline. And maybe, we were part of some of that, but because I think the consumer has fallen in love with digital, which our consumer has as well. So, we have seen some shifting, as Steve mentioned earlier, we could see as much as 2% of our business this year bring down on the digital side. So there's been some shifting moving between four wall and digital, but in general I would tell you that some of those tailwinds became headwinds. And we didn't anticipate honestly the difficult business in the Texas, Oklahoma, and I'll call it the coldest regions as it's often due to the pullback in the oil markets, that was very, very difficult to overcome. Okay. That's been it (54:24)", "Operator", "And we do have our next question from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc.", "Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.", "Thanks. Good evening. I'm curious, I think you had talked in the past about a labor optimization that you were going to put in place in late 2017. Is it your expectation that you will roll that out in late 2017? And if so, do you expect to roll it out via test or all at once and what kind of impact might that have from the tail of the year?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Ben, I think what we talked about is that we were going to look at labor management and payroll management as kind of a combined or task management as a combined system, and we talked about starting it \u2013 hoping to start it in the fall of this year and running it into 2018 as a completion. So, we're still on task to do that, we have not chosen the final testing yet, but we plan to do that by midyear.", "Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then if I could just one quick follow-up on the deflation, 50 basis points in the quarter I think for the year you had previously said you expected a range of 10 basis points to 30 basis points deflation. Is that still your expectation or keeping that higher-level deflation in 1Q, has that changed at all?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. I would say that we are seeing a little bit more of deflation than our original expectations. And we still believe that we're seeing signs that it would moderate in the back half of the year. So, as we saw 50 basis points in Q1, I would say our expectation on deflation is more like a 20 basis points to 30 basis point impact for the year, with that being closer to the high end of that range in Q2 and moderating in the back half.", "Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good evening. I had two quick follow-ups, so the 2% to 3% comp in April, does that include what sounds like a small headwind from the overall Easter shift? And then can you talk about the performance of the mature store cohort relative to chain and perhaps if you've isolated it along weather impacted and non-weather impacted markets like facing North versus South?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Okay, Chris. I'll address the first question there. Yeah, Easter is a headwind in that 2% to 3%. For the quarter, that is about a 60 basis point headwind on Q2, and the lost comp sales day for the year is about a 20 basis point impact for the year.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And that 2% to 3%, that 60 basis points is like an annualized \u2013 the 2% to 3% is sort of netted at 60 basis points basically.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "That's right. It assumes and includes for the quarter a 60 basis point headwind on the quarter.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "And the second question, could you repeat the second question?", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So the question is, can you talk about the performance of your mature stores versus I know the West is seeing some lift out of a younger store base out there. So how are the mature stores performing, and obviously you had some in weather impacted markets and some in not. So maybe the stores in the South where there was a lot less weather impacting the overall trend, those mature stores?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure. Yeah. Directionally, what we're seeing is that as we've said, the less mature stores have a faster high comp sales growth than the mature stores. And then \u2013 so there is somewhat of a gap between the 5 years or less stores in the mature ones. And consistent, at least looking at Q1, the mature stores were less than the less mature stores, but they behaved similar geographically. So when it comes to mature stores in the West to mature stores in the South, they outperformed the mature stores in the North. So there's somewhat of a gap between those, but they behaved very similar. And for the quarter, the mature stores had the same typical headwinds as the less mature store due to weather.", "Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Understood. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wesbush Securities.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Thanks a lot and good evening.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "How are you doing, Seth?", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Good. My question is around the gross margins. Just if you could provide a little more detail, maybe disaggregate the gross margin performance a bit more for this quarter between markdowns, promo and freight, and then provide some \u2013 a little bit more of color and expectations for which of these buckets will improve the most for you to achieve your guidance for over 25 basis points of improvement in gross margins down the year?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure. For first quarter, the product rate being the clearance, markdown as well as any promos along with freight were the most impactful factors to margin. And then I would say, after that the headwind that we saw and knew we were cycling, but the next most impactful would've been cycling the benefit we got from the discounts for inventory related to new distribution center. The other headwinds that we described were of lesser impact.", "Specific to go forward, Q1 did have some unique items in there. So I'd first say that, the things that were unique to the first quarter such as cycling the vendor funding related to the inventory in the DC, the clearance on the winter seasonal goods and even to some extent the additional promotions that Steve talked to were unique to first quarter. However, we do see some greater headwinds than originally expected in freight. We had said that we saw \u2013 or expected freight to be about a 10 basis point headwind in 2017. Based on what we're seeing today, that's more closer to a 20 basis point headwind and then we do have a few other areas that mix particular that if we continue to grow strong in the C.U.E. items, mix will likely be a bit of a headwind for Q2 and potential for us go forward.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Got it. So, just to understand that 25 basis points to 30 basis point gross margin improvement for the year that guidance, is that still good or do you think there might be a little bit of downside risk to that based on freight and mix?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. And I would just say, again, we're not updating guidance, but I will say as I look to Q2 that it'll be more challenges, more headwind to try to achieving that range for Q2 than our original expectations.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Understood. Thank you and good luck.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.", "Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So, Greg, I want to go back to some of the comments you made in your prepared comments, just with regard to the headwinds and tailwinds and specifically with respect to the C.U.E. business. So, overall, is C.U.E. still \u2013 as you think about that analysis, is C.U.E. still a tailwind to the business and maybe explain why there? Then with regard to Q1, it seemed \u2013 the color you gave us, it seemed that the C.U.E. sales held up well, so I wanted to confirm that, indeed did the C.U.E. sales help volume, and I guess, the question I'd ask there is, did the promotions and all help to drive better C.U.E. sales in Q1? Thanks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. Brian, let me answer it this way. C.U.E. business is \u2013 the things that you'll find in our store at any given time of the year that makes sense for the customer that they buy in high volume and high quantity, hydraulic fluid, wood pellets, certain products in feed and food, so on and so forth. C.U.E. units continue to increase. So we feel good about our unit increase overall in the C.U.E. categories which tells us we're still taking share. However, deflation continues to play a major role in some of those C.U.E. categories.", "So, I've said this before, a bag of bird seed that was at one time we considered as a C.U.E. item in the first quarter that was selling for $19 to $22, is now selling for $16, let's say it as an example, due to deflation. Those are tough comparisons to offset. I've got to see another 30%-some-odd increase in units just to be able to offset last year's comparable volume. So there is where some of that quirkiness comes into play. But, we're very, very comfortable with C.U.E., we track it very closely. Steve and the team have a pulse on it, literally daily and we continue to see share \u2013 take share.", "Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good evening, guys. I apologize, if this was asked before, because I was disconnected earlier. But I guess my question is, how should we think about the balance sheet going forward? Look I know this was a tough quarter, but we had AP'd inventory ratios fall pretty sharply. You guys are paying a dividend, you bought back a bunch of stocks, your debt levels have risen quite a bit. So I guess the question is, should we expect more debt to come on the balance sheet during the balance of the year, does that cause you potentially to pull back on your buyback program, because you don't want to add more debt? Or will the seasonal cash flow cadence that you're anticipating help reduce those cash needs? Thanks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure. Scot, I'll first start with \u2013 this quarter had some unique items. Steve mentioned the earlier spring seasonal buys. And so, with our effort in January, February, addressing what looked to be potentially be an early start to spring, we pulled some receipts forward. So in regards to the balance sheet on the AP and the inventory side, it's somewhat unique to the quarter in that, the growth in the inventory is fresh spring-related items. We pulled it forward that played into the timing of our payments, and so you see that on the balance sheet. To a lesser extent, one other thing that we faced in Q1, this one, we face whenever we have a 53rd week shift, the end of the quarter ended a week later, that does impact the timing of a key payables point to our merchant and rent vendors, and so you see a little bit of that drag compared to the prior quarter as well.", "In regards to debt, I would just say that we look at Q1 and Q3 as those peak particular times, and you're seeing with the uniqueness a heightened level of debt, we expect in Q2 for that to go back to normal levels. We've said we're targeting and comfortable with the 2 times debt leverage ratio and other than a few particular peak times, we see ourselves at about $400 million in debt \u2013 $450 million in debt at the end of the year.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Got it. Very helpful.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "And we don't expect at this point that to change any of our plan or cadence on capital allocation or dividend or share repurchase.", "Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Understood. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alan Rifkin with BTIG.", "Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC", "Thank you very much. With respect to the gross margin, Greg, you cited that e-commerce was a headwind on the gross margin. So assuming that e-comm continues to grow at a rate greater than your stores, what kind of level can we assume will be kind of a continuous gross margin headwind from the fact that you're growing e-comm at a greater rate? And then my second question is, I appreciate the color you provided with respect to the 600 basis point delta on a market basis as a result of the weather. I was curious if you can maybe segment that a different way and tell us how much in total that the oil patch states underperformed the rest of the corporate average? Thank you.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure, Alan I'll take those. First in regards to the e-commerce and the gross margin, we called out the growth in e-commerce and its impact on freight. So, with our e-commerce business growing, it does have a higher freight rate and we've always had some level of burden, but e-commerce as small as it is, it's not had much of an impact, we are excited about the growth we have in the e-commerce business and we have seen a few basis points increase in the burden on the freight line within gross margin. So, we called it out. I believe that we'll see that continue in the future quarters. And as our e-commerce business grows, it could have a 1 basis points or 2 basis points impact throughout the year on the gross margin rate. And then \u2013 yeah, go ahead.", "Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC", "No please.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Okay.", "Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC", "The delta on the oil patch?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure, sure. In regards to the oil patch, I'd first say that the Texas region like much of the South had less of an impact on weather. So, we did not see as much volatility in sales in the Texas area, but specific to the oil patch, as Greg mentioned, we see it moderating and in the quarter we had a close to 30 basis point headwind against the \u2013 30 basis points headwind on the comps due to the oil patch stores.", "Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Next we have Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I thought if I could ask about BOPIS a little bit and then specifically to give us some examples, what types of categories or products you're seeing strong there, how this is incremental to current traffic? And then, similar to that, at the Analyst Day, I remember you speaking a little bit about potentially thinking about a subscription based program for some of the renewable C.U.E. based items, and what your sort of thought process is around that at the moment?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. Adam, this is Steve. I would tell you that, when it comes to Buy Online Pickup in Store, what we're finding is, is that our customers have an interest across the four walls. It's nothing in specific. In many cases, it's in multiples that they're buying. So it maybe fencing outside. It could be product that is on promotion for example, where they're maybe trying to reserve something, so they can get in and get the deal. But it's really across the entire spectrum of the four walls. So it's nothing that I can point to and say that 80% of what we're seeing there is one category or even a one side of the store.", "The second question was regarding the subscription. We talked about ONETractor and we talked about anytime, anywhere and anywhere customers want to shop a Tractor, and one of the capabilities that we're working on right now is subscription. It's one of many. And we fully anticipate making good traction on that throughout this year. And you will see us as we continue to talk with you all in these conference calls, we'll give you the traction that we're making, but it's definitely high on the list for us.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Just on the BOPIS answer just real quick if I could? So I'm unsure that in future, things that are already in the store and I imagine you generally having already high capture rate, the customers in your area, how it's actually incremental? I mean, would these people not becoming into the store to begin with to buy these things?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure. Well, I would tell you, it's two-prong. Yes, in some cases and I think if you would talk to most retailers, they would tell you that because I have certain retailers that I go to, that I would have gone to anyways and I use Buy Online Pickup in Store. But I would also tell you there has been several examples where we've modified our marketing budget in our spend there. And we have gone from what has been traditional over to digital, and buying SEM search words, we have found that customers are going in. I'll use the example of, the first Buy Online Pickup order that we had was actually a customer who was searching for trailers, and they never shopped at Tractor Supply before, searched the word, went on to our site, reviewed it, looked at the content, used Buy Online Pickup in Store and came in and bought two of them from us. So it's hard to pinpoint exactly who is using it, but I can tell you that we do believe it's a mix of both.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Magee with SunTrust.", "Mitch van Zelfden - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Yeah, hi. Good afternoon everyone. This is actually Mitch on for David. Just ex-ing out the weather impact in the first quarter, how do you feel about big ticket demand in general?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "What I would say in regards to big ticket is, what we saw was the biggest headwind on the big ticket sales was the spring seasonal product. And so, I would say that big ticket demand was flat to potentially slightly positive, if you ex out the headwind that we're up against last year in the March spring seasonal. So big-ticket clearly became a stronger component of the average ticket in the month of March, as we cycled the strong spring seasonal and did not achieve those spring seasonal sales in Q1.", "Mitch van Zelfden - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Hey, guys. Yeah. Most of my questions were answered. I just want to follow-up on one other thing. Are there any new products that you guys have in the store or testing, I recall like a year ago, maybe like you tried some things with kayaks or something like outdoorsy or are there things that are maybe tangential to the business that, that maybe a way to drive additional traffic?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah. Joe, this is Steve. And I would tell you, we've been talking a lot about different digital things that we're doing and ways that we're attracting new customers in our stores, but there's also an opportunity with our existing customers base to sell them new and different things like you're mentioning. And so, for example this year, we've expanded beekeeping, because we know our customers are self-reliant, and that is an unique item that really is all about sustainability, that we've expanded our organic selection both in lawn and garden, as well as in our livestock feed section, and we're seeing incredibly nice comps there.", "A lot of the resets we've done in adding new brands, we're expanding 4health to customers, our outdoor sporting goods for example continues to grow. We've added it to more stores at this point. We're up to between 200 stores and 300 stores. We've expanded ammo, which is another key item for us, so we think our customers are looking for it. And I'll even go as far as to tell you that we're testing live crickets and worms in a lot of these sporting goods stores as well, to see if there's an interest or a demand from our customers. So there is a lot of things going on within the four walls themselves that should continue to drive that momentum that we've talked about in the past.", "Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "That's great. Thank you for that and good luck with the quarter.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Denise Chai with Bank of America.", "Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you. You mentioned before that you've got tools to look at competitor pricing now, so what are some of the key learnings so far and what opportunities do you see in pricing?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Denise, this is Steve again. I would tell you that's one of the capabilities right now that we're working on. When we talk about all the new things we're putting into and our capabilities for ONETractor. So while we have a tool out there today that is going out and web scraping for us and it's been effective for us for the most part, we've had that for now two years, I would tell you a more comprehensive tool that would give us more insight into more competitors and more SKUs will be much more beneficial as we move forward and I'll be able to give you more on that probably in the upcoming quarters.", "Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks. And then just back to big ticket for a moment. It sounds like you're \u2013 it's like, excuse me, some kind of weather and timing impacts and things. If you could put it aside it sounds like you're actually a little bit more positive towards big ticket, so in the past when there has been big ticket cycle, how long did it last?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "The last part of the question is tough Denise, as it relates to weather. So, I'll let Steve maybe think about that, I want to see if he can go back in history. But I would tell you that generally big ticket is more significant in Q2 than it is in Q1 with the spring seasonal. And the only thing I did mention in the last time was the headwind of safes. And so, big ticket spring seasonal was the biggest headwind, outside of the weather, there would have been a little bit of a headwind still with the sluggishness of the safe sales.", "Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "This conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to our speakers for closing remarks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Okay. Thank you everyone for your continued support and interest in Tractor Supply.

Sales were strong throughout the quarter, and broad-based across all of our major product categories and geographic regions. Moderate temperatures and higher moisture levels throughout the summer months led to an extended spring and summer selling season, and our team did an exceptional job of positioning our inventories to capture those sales. We experienced strong demand for C.U.E., seasonal products and big-ticket products, and with our supply chain capabilities, we were able to flow inventory back into our stores to address the increased customer demand for product.", "While deflation did moderate somewhat in the quarter, it has continued to be a headwind in several key categories. And in many of the energy markets we serve, we have seen our business improve, but by no means have all of these markets fully returned to prior sales levels. For the third quarter, comparable store sales increased 6.6%, with store transaction counts up 5%, and average ticket up 1.5%. Our online traffic was strong with unique visits up 20% and 66% of all visits to our tractorsupply.com site continue to come through a mobile device.", "We did experience a marginal sales lift from the hurricanes late in the quarter, and we estimate this added about 120 basis points to comparable store sales. But more importantly, we are extremely proud of the way our team members and our vendor community worked together to provide needed emergency response products to the hurricane impacted communities. Team members in our stores, distribution centers, and store support center worked tirelessly to help our local communities in their greatest time of need. We believe it is this type of neighborly helping hand that makes Tractor Supply a special company, and strengthens our customer's affinity to the Tractor Supply brand.", "Our customers have trust that Tractor Supply will provide their everyday basic products for living the rural lifestyle, and we continue to invest in our capabilities to better meet their evolving needs. Our stores, our people and our systems are all critical components that enable us to serve our customers, and we continue to be committed to our goal of digitizing our business by closely linking the physical and digital storefronts into one seamless shopping environment for them. We call this our ONETractor initiative.", "Our Buy Online Pick Up in Store and Drop Ship programs continue to build momentum and resonate with customers with roughly 75% of online orders being picked up in our stores in the third quarter. Additionally, the average order size for a Buy Online Pick Up in Store order remains significantly higher than the company average. And our customer data indicates that Buy Online Pick Up in Store is particularly popular for larger projects and difficult to transport items, such as fencing products that require a larger number of components to complete the job. Buy Online Pick Up in Store allows our customers the option to research and select the products they need, that know that their order will be ready for pick up at a store close by, and thus saving them time.", "Also, our Neighbor's Club customer regards program continues to be very popular. Enrollment in the program has exceeded our expectations, and we finished the quarter with over 5 million members. Our Neighbor's Club members are some of our best and most engaged customers, and while we are still in the early stages of rolling out the benefits of this program, we will leverage this customer data over time to strengthen our relationships and refine our personalized communications with this customer. Now, there's two other technology initiatives that we continue to test, and we believe could be meaningful longer term. They are mobile POS and stockyard.", "Mobile POS is an in-store initiative that allows our associates to find information, locate product, and check inventory in surrounding stores, and then process the sale through a mobile device. Our team members have embraced the technology and by using mobile POS are making the shopping trip easier for our customers. Stockyard, another store-level initiative that merges our online and in-store capabilities, allows our store team members and customers to tap into a much wider assortment of products, utilizing our vendor's inventories. This extends our digital footprint and gives our team members and customers access to merchandise not normally carried in our stores. This is particularly helpful when a customer is looking for a unique or a hard-to-find item that may be make or model specific. The team member and the customer can research the sought-after item on the kiosk, quickly address an immediate need, saving them both time.", "Now, a little over a year ago, we acquired Petsense, and we remain pleased with the opportunities for this business. While immaterial to our overall results, Petsense stores generated positive comps and double-digit total revenue growth for the quarter. We have spent the past year gaining a better understanding of the business, and are working to improve the model while integrating back-of-house functions where possible. Utilizing the Tractor Supply test-to-learn methodology, one area of focus has been on the development of exclusive brands. Through this effort, we are launching an exclusive brand of premium dog and cat food in Petsense stores this month, and it's labeled True Source. Petsense will also launch an e-commerce site late in the fourth quarter for purchasing online, and Buy Online and Pick Up in Store will be available sometime in spring of 2018. We continue to believe that the rural pet market is an under-served market with fragmented competition and significant growth opportunities, and we are prudently investing in people, processes and technology to develop and grow this business for the longer term.", "So, let me summarize. We are delighted with our overall third quarter results, and our teams did a terrific job capitalizing on the extended summer selling season. We know our customers look to us for their everyday basic needs and we are making timely investments in our business to better serve them. With a loyal and growing customer base and continued convergence of our physical and digital storefronts, we believe we are well-positioned to drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value. I want to thank all of our Tractor Supply and Petsense team members around the country for all that you do. You are the driving force \u2013 those who serve our customers and execute our business plan every day.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Kurt to review our third quarter financial results.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 30, 2017, on a consolidated year-over-year basis, net sales increased 11.6% to $1.72 billion, resulting in net income of $91.9 million, or $0.72 per diluted share. Comparable store sales increased 6.6% versus a reported decrease of 0.6% last year. As a reminder, our Q3 2017 comparable store results reflect the calendar shift associated with the 53rd week in 2016. Adjusting for the week shift, last year's third quarter comparable store sales decrease would have been 1.1%.", "As Greg mentioned, comps were positive across all geographic regions and major product categories, and benefited from an extended summer selling season. Sales also benefited later in the quarter from the sale of emergency response products related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma. And we estimate this benefited same-store sales by approximately 120 basis points. As a result, sales were strong in all three months of the quarter, with July being the highest comp increase.", "Comparable store transaction count increased 5%. This compares to prior-year's reported 0.5% increase. Comparable store transaction count increased across all regions of the country, and was driven principally by strength in our C.U.E. items, along with strength in seasonal categories and emergency response-related products, as well. Average comp ticket increased 1.5% compared to prior-year's reported 1.1% decrease. This quarter's increase was driven principally by the mix of goods, as well as the strength of big-ticket sales, partially offset by deflation. Big ticket overall comp was above chain average, principally driven by strong sales of generators, as well as strength in utility vehicles and fuel-handling items. We estimate deflation impacted average ticket by approximately 30 basis points. As a reminder, Petsense store sales are not yet reflected in our reported comparable store sales results, as those stores will be included in the store base beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017.", "Now turning to gross margin, which increased 20 basis points to 34.9%. We were pleased with how the team managed margin during the quarter. Direct product margin was positive to prior year, with rate being the primary driver. The rate improvement was driven principally through strong inventory management and strategic sourcing initiatives. Additionally, we were less promotional during the quarter, as the extended summer selling season resulted in strong seasonal sell through.", "The mix of merchandise did not have a significant impact on direct product margin, as the strong comp sales performance was broad based across all product categories. The unfavorable impact of strong generator sales was offset by the favorable impact of strong sales of truck accessories, tools and hardware, which are above-margin categories.", "Freight, however, negatively impacted gross margin, principally due to a greater mix of freight-intensive categories, higher average fuel costs, and, to a lesser extent, growth in our online business. Petsense provided a slight benefit to gross margin, as these stores operate at a higher rate than Tractor Supply stores.", "For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, deleveraged by 80 basis points to 26.3% of sales compared to 25.5% of sales in the prior-year's quarter. The deleverage was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and additional investments in key strategic areas. Incentive compensation expense represented approximately 40 basis points of the deleverage in the quarter. The strong performance in this year's third quarter versus last year's third quarter drove the higher incentive compensation expense.", "By comparison, incentive expense declined approximately 60 basis points as a percentage of sales in last year's third quarter from softer sales and earnings. The remaining increase in the SG&A rate was driven primarily by investments in payroll and other strategic initiatives to drive customer service and long-term growth, as well as the addition of the Petsense SG&A, which tends to operate at a higher expense ratio than Tractor Supply. Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was essentially flat at 36.4% compared to 36.5% last year.", "Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had a cash balance of $70 million and $510 million in outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $56 million and $295 million in outstanding debt last year. During the third quarter, we acquired 1.4 million shares for $78.5 million through our stock repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have acquired a total of 5.2 million shares for $326.6 million. The reported consolidated average inventory per-store decline of 9.2% includes the impact of Petsense stores on the chain average. Exclusive of Petsense, average inventory levels per store decreased 1.9% against last year's third quarter. We are pleased with the productivity of our inventory during the quarter as well as the management of our working capital.", "Now, with respect to our outlook, based on the trends and results in the third quarter, we're updating our outlook for the full-year fiscal 2017. We expect full-year sales to range from $7.17 billion to $7.22 billion, comparable store sales increase between 1.7% and 2.2%, and net income to range from $416 million to $421 million, and earnings per diluted share to be $3.25 to $3.29.", "Assumed in this guidance is an operating margin decline of 70 basis points to 90 basis points, a tax rate of 36.5%, average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 128 million to 128.4 million and capital expenditures of $230 million to $250 million. We expect to hit our new store targets of 100 Tractor Supply stores and 25 Petsense stores, and continue to be pleased with new store productivity.", "With respect to the fourth quarter, we experienced warmer than normal weather conditions during the first two weeks of the quarter. However, where the weather has turned cooler, we have begun to see increased demand for cold weather seasonal products. We believe we are well-positioned heading into the fall and winter season with a solid plan to drive winter seasonal merchandise when the colder weather arrives.", "As a reminder, adjusting for the week shift, the fourth quarter is cycling prior-year positive 3.8% comparable store sales results. We expect deflation in the fourth quarter, and the full year to be approximately 30 basis points.", "With respect to gross margin, we will continue to use our price management tools to drive both sales and margin while remaining focused on our goal of growing market share. We expect headwinds from both product mix and transportation costs in the fourth quarter, and therefore, we are targeting gross margin to be flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter in comparison to prior year.", "With respect to SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, we will continue to drive operating efficiencies to offset incremental investments in key strategic initiatives. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate SG&A deleverage of approximately 80 to 100 basis points. Factors to consider are: first, we expect to continue to invest payroll in our stores, distribution centers, and customer solution center to drive strong customer-service levels. This investment reflects incremental hours and, to a lesser extent, higher average wage rates compared to prior year. We're also cycling favorable medical and worker's compensation-related costs in the prior year.", "Depreciation expense is expected to grow 11% to 12% over the prior year, resulting from our key strategic investments in technology and supply chain enhancements. Additionally, we are cycling the prior year 53rd week, which benefited last year's fourth quarter expense leverage. We will of course provide our initial outlook for 2018 on our year-end conference call, but in keeping with our past practices, let me provide you with some considerations for your modeling into next year.", "We expect to finish the construction of our New York distribution center in Q3 2018 and begin servicing stores in late fourth quarter. We are forecasting that related pre-opening expenses and incremental operating expenses for this distribution center to increase SG&A on a year-over-year basis, impacting earnings per share by approximately $0.03 to $0.04, with most of the impact in the second half of the year. Also, should we achieve our targeted results in 2018, higher incentive compensation could raise SG&A and impact earnings by $0.06 to $0.08.", "We expect some moderate impact from higher-wage inflation at both the stores and distribution centers due to pressures from both state regulations, as well as competition. Additionally, we anticipate continued headwind from freight expense due to growth in C.U.E. and other more freight-intensive products, higher average transportation costs and growth in our online business.", "Over the past two years, we have invested in several key initiatives to position the company for long-term growth. We have managed the business and related investment spending to absorb these costs in our financial model while delivering solid bottom-line growth. Therefore, as we continue to invest in long term growth of the company, our goal is to execute these incremental investments while managing the financial impact to enable us to deliver earnings growth.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Our first question comes from David Magee with SunTrust. Your line is open.", "David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Yes, hi. Thank you, and a nice quarter, guys.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thanks, David.", "David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Can you talk a little bit more about just the transportation issue, and maybe a bit more color about what type of items cost you more? I know you're investing a lot in improving the sort of the flow through of that, but is that something that is likely to peak next year, do you think, and starts to decline thereafter?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, David, this is Kurt, and good question. On the transportation side what we're seeing are a number of factors. The growth in C.U.E. continues to have pressure on the transportation freight expense as those items, bulkier, heavier commodity items have a higher freight rate to them. Additionally, we certainly were able to capitalize on opportunities to sell certain items that are bulkier and big product that have a larger freight charge to them. That was part of the third quarter. That is a little bit more specific to third and perhaps fourth quarter.", "I will tell you that what we're seeing in addition to that is on the oil pricing and the cost of fuel, we saw an increase in the third quarter, and in the fourth quarter we expect to have higher average fuel costs. And then lastly, both domestically and internationally we are seeing increases in transportation costs, and those items we expect to carry into next year.", "David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you for that, and I guess \u2013 and secondly, if you could give a little color about what you're seeing with regard to your competition online and any price movement online that might be surprising either way to you.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, this is Steve. We're keeping a close eye on it. What I can tell you is that no different than we do in our stores, we've got different categories of merchandise, whether it be items we're very competitive on, items that are more convenience and some that are balanced.", "And I've seen a lot of reports out there kind of trying to project where Tractor is relative to their pricing competitiveness online. What I can tell you is is that the vast majority of our business is done in stores. And the store brands that we carry, we feel really good about where we're at online. We do have about an additional 70,000 items that are online that we don't have in the stores, and we're constantly going through and checking those items, but those items don't have a significant impact on our revenue. So, again, I would tell you we feel pretty good about where we're at. We feel good on the consumable side of our business and a lot of the big ticket, especially the products that we carry in our stores.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good afternoon, Simeon. How are you?", "Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good. How are you doing? Just a follow up for Kurt. I don't think you mentioned it explicitly in, I guess, the preview guidance for 2018. I think you mentioned that SG&A will be up and you mentioned a couple of the headwinds to gross margins. And I didn't know if there's offsets to it or if what you're implying is that overall margin could be under pressure? And then at what sort of comp rate is it normalized? I think the 3%, 3.5% or so camp rate, is that how you're thinking about comp growth relative to the other plans you laid out?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure, Simeon. And I mentioned this briefly on the last call, too. When we look ahead to 2018, first I'd say with fourth quarter still ahead of us, and right now we're heavily into building the budget and the forecast for 2018, I can't necessarily get into too much detail. But I'd tell you that when we look at 2018 on the gross margin side, we do see the expectation that freight headwinds to continue into 2018.", "As we said before, 2018 will continue to be a year we invest in our long-term growth initiatives. So for the items that I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, I believe there's SG&A headwinds, as I mentioned. And I would say at this point, we would expect to see operating margin for next year have somewhat of a slight decline. A little bit early to say. We'll have more information as we end Q4. At this point, looking out, I can probably just tell you that we're somewhat realistic and cautious on operating margin and would expect to see some slight decline.", "Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks for the color. And good luck in Q4.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.", "Atul Maheswari - UBS Securities LLC", "Good evening. This is Atul Maheswari on for Michael Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking our questions. See, your guidance implies that the fourth quarter comp would be in the 1% range at the midpoint. I know you're lapping significantly comparisons in the fourth quarter, so what gives you confidence that this guidance will be achievable? Do you need favorable weather to comp at that level, or do you believe your initiatives will help you meet this guidance, even if the weather is not very cooperative? Thank you.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, it's a good question. On the fourth quarter, I'd say the couple of assumptions are that we do see strength in the core of the business. And that's a key part of our assumption. The fourth quarter is a quarter where weather can heavily impact the performance of it. So, the assumed guidance range assumes somewhat of a normal fourth quarter, and expecting continued strength in our C.U.E. product. Any favorable weather or change in weather that's unfavorable could heavily impact the performance of the top-line sales.", "Atul Maheswari - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And as my follow-up, can you quantify as to how much the milder summer helped your comp in the third quarter? And also if there were any geographies of noticeable strength? Can you quantify how much those regions comped above the company average?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, this is Kurt, and the best I can tell you is that, as we mentioned, the strongest month of the quarter was July, and that's where we saw the extended summer-selling season. And I don't have specifics on exactly the impact to the overall top line. I would tell you that it was beneficial to July and it was not a strong significant impact to the overall comps. It was probably somewhere around 100 basis points to something less than that.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Ah, yes, hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on the quarter, as well.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you, Adam.", "Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. Of course. So, the first question I wanted to ask was on mobile and the strength you're seeing there. And then, potentially, sort of tying that into Neighbor's Club. One sort of segment that's always eluded you has been the aware non-shopper and the non-aware non-shopper. And I remember, maybe, several quarters ago, you gave an example of someone looking to buy a trailer. They'd never shopped there. They came in and bought one. As you're looking at the mobile orders, and as you're looking at your Neighbor's Club enrollment, what type of overlap is there between those two? And, I guess, sort of the question is are you seeing that some of these mobile customers are new customers, and then they're signing up for Neighbor's Club, I guess is one.", "And then secondly, sort of similar to the last question, could you sort of maybe discuss how much confidence you've gotten from running longer hours, now that you are doing that?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Okay, yes, sure. Let me start. This is Steve. The first question you ask about mobile, Neighbor's Club and tying the two together, here's what I can tell you. Our customers have always used mobile and we are getting more traction from mobile. As Greg said, we've got about 20% of the growth of our web is from unique customers. So, what we're seeing is more customers come into the fold that are relatively new to our site, and probably new to our brand. A lot of that has to do with a lot of the SEM marketing that we're doing out there, what we're going in social media space. And I do believe that's actually bringing more folks into the fold, or at least introducing them into the brand.", "Now, in terms of whether or not they're new to Neighbor's Club, that's a little harder for us to understand, because the Neighbor's Club program is new. And now that we're able to have as many as 5 million members, we're able to now go back through and check with those members to see if they're using mobile, desktop, or how they're coming to us, whether that be in-store or not. So, we'll probably know more once we start cycling more of this. At this point, Adam, that's the best I can give you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Adam, this is Greg to talk to you about the longer hours of operation. When we made a slight change back in the latter part of first, second quarter to stay open until 9:00, that was due to customer request. They were coming to us in droves saying, hey, listen, I need to be able to get to your store after 8:00 and pick things up. It's still light outside. I've still got work to do. Why are you guys closing at 8:00? And we had, I can't tell you, how many customers coming to us through email and through social media saying, why are you closing so early? Many of our competition stay open until 9:00, some stay open even until 10:00. So, we made the adjustment based upon that. My belief is is that we may have seen a slight uptick, but generally speaking, it was business that probably would have come to us the following day or morning. I think we just made it more convenient for our customers to stay open an extra hour. And it cost us a little bit in labor, but it was the right thing to do from a customer-service standpoint.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thanks a lot and congrats on the great quarter. First question, just on the C.U.E. categories. It sounds like C.U.E. continues to outperform. Is there a way to break that down further and to see if there are particular categories within that, that are leading the growth?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Seth, this is Steve. What I can tell you is we talk a lot about C.U.E. being across the four walls. But if I were to give you any indication on the product categories that did perform, we continue to see growth in those categories that continue to fuel our business. We did a reset in the livestock feed category in Q3, and we believe that that added some value. We localized a number of assortments, brought in some new SKUs and we continue to see growth in organic livestock feed.", "In addition to that, we did a reset in our pet food segment. And I know there's a lot of concern, a lot of buzz out there around pet food and the internet, but we're still continuing to see growth, not just in top line, but in units as well. And so that continues to do well for us. And so \u2013 and even in the lubricant category. So, without getting too specific, generally speaking, we continue to see growth, and we believe that's continuing to bring footsteps through the front doors.", "Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. And, I guess, a related question on the pet category. Is there a way to give us a sense of how Petsense is comping on its own versus pet comps within the Tractor stores? And then, just bigger picture on Petsense, now, a year in, any more color on what you're learning there, and how you're thinking about growth for the Petsense concept? Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well, we won't get too specific on comps, but I can tell you that it's running very much similar to how we're doing in Tractor Supply. So they're both running very positive. Second, as far as the overall growth and where this is headed, we've still got some integration things that we're doing, later this year, and the first part of next, and we're going to still say that there's many more hundreds of stores that we can open in Petsense, for Petsense in the rural environment.", "But we've got to get some other things in the works. We've got to get the website up. We've got to have some other structural things going on at Petsense to bring it kind of into the fold of how we operate at Tractor, and then I think you'll see us start to accelerate. So this year was a year of learning. What do we have? What does it look like? 2018 is the year of moving it forward, and I think beyond 2018 is the acceleration point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Good evening.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "How are you?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good evening, Steven.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "So I wanted to focus on I guess in-store merchandising and maybe opportunities right as we think out here. So question for both Greg and Steve, if you can. So can you discuss the cadence of the 4Q seasonal resets by region, and the flexibility around the timing of the roll-out? And then as we think about as we head into 2018 and continuing kind of comp growth, where do you see the greatest opportunity within the box, right, as it relates to future category resets and new product introduction, right? What gets you excited about what you're putting forth to the consumer?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Okay. Steven, this is Steve. Let me go ahead and start. What I can tell you is is that we talked about the extended selling season for the spring/summer goods, and part of that, I think, we actually drove. And I say that because we've left more stores on year-round for a lot of the spring/summer goods in the Southern part of the U.S. Not only has it helped us operationally, but it's also gives us an opportunity to take advantage of a longer season. So that's some of the work we've done, and I think we're going to benefit from some of that not just in Q3, but maybe even a little bit in early Q4.", "In terms of the north, the set dates were very similar to what we did a year ago. I do think that every year our planning team, as they mature, continues to do a better job in assorting those stores from a timely standpoint, and also with the assortments that make the most sense for us. So I believe that we're really well positioned as we go into the back half of this year.", "Now in terms of what gets me excited about the inside of the box. I would tell you that there's a number of things. First off, in Q3, we had a strong performance within the four walls of the business. And while I know we talk a lot about the C.U.E. business and how that's performing, and we should, because it's doing well, there are other things outside of just C.U.E. that we're working on as well.", "In terms of things like big ticket, we've done some resets relative to log splitters and generators. We're even looking at our safe assortment, making modifications to that. On decor and spring goods \u2013 or, I'm sorry \u2013 fall and holiday goods, we're building off the momentum of what we had in spring, which was very strong for us. And I think we're going to have a really solid season in the back half of this year. As a matter of fact, the early signs right now are strong. And we're also launching a Trisha Yearwood decor collection, which we're kind of excited about, and we think it's going to really respond well with our customer base. We tested it in the spring.", "And then I would also lastly suggest to you that C.U.E. is still a focus for us. And we launched our version of 4health called UNTAMED, which is a high-protein diet, and it's already exceeded our original forecast. And I think our customers are responding favorably there. There's more opportunities within pet, we believe, as we continue to learn from Petsense and apply some of those learnings to our box as well and vice versa.", "And then in feed, I still believe that there's long-term growth for us as we continue to work our way into markets and consolidate what's taking place out there in that business. So across the board, and across the spectrum, I think there's opportunities, and I'm still pretty bullish on where they are.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you, Steve.", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good evening, guys.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good evening.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "You have a lot of visibility on some signals in your business. You have the pellet sales, you have layaway of pellets, and I think log splitters and so forth sales in the north. So last year, I remember you talked about the warm prior-year winter and the hot summer really didn't have \u2013 wasn't pulling the customer into the store for layaway of pellets and the early heating season was weak, as well. So, curious, what are you seeing in terms of those categories where you get an early read on how the heating business is setting up for the fourth quarter?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Chris, this is Steve. What I can tell you is \u2013 as Kurt mentioned earlier, that the early part of October started off a little warm and customers a lot of times buy on need. And when you come off of different seasons, there's usually early demand or not, based on what they remember from the prior year.", "We did have a cold December, but that was about it last year. And even when you worked in there, for the first part of this year, it was fairly mild compared to the year before. So our pellet \u2013 just to give you a sense for it \u2013 it picked up as it got colder, but, again, it's geographic. And a lot of our pellet business is done in the very Northeast. So, if you look at where it got cold, we saw demand for the cold-weather products. But as you moved further East to the Northeast, where it wasn't quite as cold yet, I still think that there's some pent-up demand that will come out once the colder weather hits.", "Log splitters, that's a little similar. We did do a reset, updated our log splitters, so we're seeing a little better performance than we saw a year ago. But that's what I can give you.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Understood. And you called out specifically, I think, $0.10 to $0.12 of earnings headwinds from the margins and from the SG&A side next year. You came in \u2013 this quarter you came in and beat the Street by $0.04. So, is the right way to think about it that maybe the Street consensus is sort of $0.10 to $0.12 too high next year? Or do we sort of offset that with a $0.04 and be more of a $0.06 to $0.08 kind of reduction in the consensus is the right ZIP code as you think about it for 2018?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Chris, this is Kurt. I'd tell you, as I was preparing items to mention for 2018, I specifically brought up things that I believe may not be in the models or may not be factored in. Items that have changed in 2017 that we believe will carry into 2018, such as transportation costs, such as some of the labor headwinds, and gave you some color on the distribution center. So, I would tell you that bringing those up, it's because I anticipate those may not be factored into 2018's guidance.", "Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "But do we have to mitigate any of that by the fact that you just beat the Street nicely on a $0.04 beat. Do we offset it with that? Or do we just think about it from a gross $0.10 to $0.12 perspective?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well, Chris, I think the one thing I'd tell you is that we don't give guidance on the quarter. And so the beat to the Street versus our internal expectations may be different. And I would tell you that the one thing in the quarter that was the primary item not expected was the $0.02 beat related to the hurricane.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Thanks a lot, and good afternoon.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Good afternoon.", "Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Can you quantify big ticket comps with and without the benefit from emergency relief products like generators?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure, Seth. I'd tell you that, as I mentioned, the big ticket sales were boosted by generator sales and other big ticket items from the hurricanes and were above chain average. When you exclude the impact of the hurricanes, big ticket had positive comps, but was slightly below the chain average.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research . Your line is open.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to poke a little bit about the company priorities. You talked a little bit about your investments in omni channel. And as we think forward, obviously you're going to build about 100 stores this year, as we think forward and you guys think about how you want to invest your capital, how do you think of stores versus e-commerce? And then I just had a quick follow-up on some of the conversations about 2018. Thanks.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Scott, this is Kurt. It's a good question and we look at both of those capital allocation investment items. New stores certainly are a key to Tractor Supply's overall growth strategy. They provide a good return on the investment. But today, what you're hearing and where we're focused on is not only growing the stores for continued top-line growth, but we're also focused on the things that we need to do and are part of our strategy for long-term growth.", "And so at this point, the 100 stores as part of our long-term growth strategy, we continue to evaluate that annually. And we do look at the e-commerce side of it. When I say e-commerce, I believe Steve and I would agree on this in that we refer to it more as the digital. Because it's an omni-channel investment. And so many of the sales can begin online. As Greg mentioned, the number of new or unique visitors to the website, how many are starting through a mobile device. So when we speak about e-commerce online investment, it's about the overall growth for Tractor Supply, both online and in the stores.", "So to get to the answer to your question, I would say that we're focused on challenging both store growth and the other digital investments, and we continue to analyze that. That could lead us to a number of store growth that is below 100 if we believe we need to manage both the capital and the SG&A burden of our investments. And we balance both of those out for the long term.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "So it is conceivable that as we get to 2018 and 2019 that we tack a little bit more towards omni-channel and digital in your thinking. And then with that thinking, this is my follow-up, could we start to maybe characterize 2018 as an investment year? Is that how you guys would maybe think about it as we go this direction? And then I'll yield. Thanks very much.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, it's a good question. I would say we've been on an increasing capital growth rate for omni-channel digital investment. We'll be near $65 million to $70 million investment this year. That number will grow next year. It may begin to stabilize on the investment specific to IT and digital at about $70 million or $80 million. But as a percentage, yeah, that's a bigger percentage. And it is a good analysis to say we'll evaluate both store capital investment along with the IT investment, and the IT investment may continue to bring a bigger percentage. And we have looked at 2017 and 2018 as investment years. So I would say it is a good way to describe 2018 continuing to have investment for the long term, and we're excited about the momentum we're seeing and some of those initiatives taking hold as part of the top-line sales growth.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thank you. I have a short-term and a long-term question. First, the short-term question. Greg, on the benefit to sales from the hurricanes, will there be a continuing benefit as insurance checks and FEMA checks are distributed in the Houston and Florida area?", "And then the long-term question goes back to the idea about the investments in 2017 and 2018. And this is very different than the outlook presented at the Analyst Meeting back in February. I was just curious, at what point did the strategy change? Did you see these investment opportunities appear that would lead to operating margin rate dropping so much compared to the original plan of a 15 basis point to 25 basis point increase?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "I'll take the first part of the question, and maybe Kurt and I will double up on the second. We're going to see very little push in the business due to what happened around the Houston area. It's very isolated. It was flooding. You won't see a tremendous amount of benefit from our side, at least the Tractor \u2013 like maybe the home centers will see for rebuilding and reconstruction. Maybe some fencing replacement, but I don't think it's going to be major. There's actually more impact, Dan, when you look at what happened with Irma as she came through Florida. The power outages and things of that nature actually drove more of the business than did Harvey.", "To say that we have changed our thinking or changed the model of where we're going on long term, it would not be absolutely what's going on here. What we've been talking about is investment in bringing the digital and the physical places together. We've been doing this now for the last four years. We are seeing some pressures through some things in transportation. We're seeing that we're going to have to step up and move a little faster maybe in some of our omni-channel efforts. But this is nothing different than what we were talking about in the investor meetings.", "There is a little bit of movement. And one analyst mentioned earlier about do you think possibly that you may look at investing more on the digital side and a little less on the physical side as you balance this out over the next year or two. And I think that's probable, to be very honest. But we want to stay out in front of this, not be behind it.", "We believe now we've got the platforms in place. We've got some things to do in CRM and Neighbor's Club yet to really develop that and mature it. We've got some more things to do in mobile within our stores, putting some more technology in the stores. We've got a few things to do yet, just inside itself and how that both these component works. We've got a very, very strong and very healthy mix of business coming through the web, but translates at the store level. Very unusual when you think about it, versus much of the other retailers that you may throw us in the same basket with. So it's a little bit of some shifting around, Dan, but really no difference in strategy. We're still funding and pushing the same priorities that we talked about.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, and Dan, this is Kurt. The only thing I'll add to that is our long-term strategy or targets have not changed, and we're not saying that they have changed. At the Investment Community Day, we emphasized the long-term growth plan, particularly, as you mentioned, operating margin growth, 15, 20 basis point improvement. We said and knew that 2017 would not be in line with those long-term growth strategies, and we said the long-term growth is three to five years. And as 2017 has played out, additional pressures and costs on transportation, payroll investments, has perhaps changed a little bit of the level of performance that we foresee for 2018, but we still see realistic long-term targets for Tractor Supply to be able to drive the top line, as well as the operating margin growth rate in the long term.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Dan, the combination of everything is we're still looking to 3% to 5% is the comp rate from a long-term standpoint. And temporarily we may not be there, but we believe that is absolutely achievable. And operating margin of around 10% is the goal. I know we haven't been there in the last couple of years. We've had some investment that we've had to make, and some other changes within some structures, but we see in front of us over the next couple of years the opportunity to get back to those levels.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Bradley B. Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Yes, thank you. And let me add my congratulations on the strong sales here as well. To follow up on a couple of the earlier questions, I guess just a clarification on CapEx. Any color about bringing that guidance down by about $20 million? And any additional color you could provide on new-store productivity, both in some of your denser markets as well as some of the newer markets out West? Thank you.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Sure, Brad. This is Kurt. First, on CapEx, the guidance coming down is really two things. Most significant is going to be timing shift of the New York distribution center, and just the timing of key initial costs that go into it are shifting out of 2017 and into 2018. The only other real key change is more of a mix of the type of stores. So we either have a low-capital intensive prototype lease store or a retrofit with more capital, and the mix of stores in the back half Q3, Q4, has impacted the expectation on capital spending that has caused us to drop that $20 million.", "New store productivity, we're \u2013 as I mentioned on the call, we are pleased with new store productivity. The trends continue to show improvement over the 2016 year. And the results that we're seeing in the last couple of quarters, I think you'd see is pretty consistent to years like 2014 and 2015. The selection of stores and our ability to enter the markets quickly we've been pretty excited about. One thing on new-store productivity as you're calculating it, just as a reminder, with the integration of Petsense, with the smaller size, different model, the new store productivity, Petsense brings \u2013 has about a 600 basis point impact, bringing the number down. So if you exclude that out of your calculation, I think you'll be more in line with what we look at as the comparable Tractor Supply new store productivity.", "Operator", "We will take our next question come from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.", "Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Good evening, everyone. Great quarter.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thanks, Chuck.", "Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "When you're looking at the third quarter, what kind of merchandising programs apart from the normal seasonal stuff worked? I noticed you had Chick Days reemerge in a number of stores, and how are you looking at that for the fourth quarter, especially if you want to get past what might be a warm start or maybe another warm winter?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, this is Steve. We did, I would say, maximize the opportunity in our center court space. We did have a fall Chick Days, as you mentioned, and we thought that that went very successfully. We heard a lot from our stores and our customers how much they enjoyed that. And we saw some sales from it. At the same time, there were a couple of other events that we did, no different than what we've done in the past, but I think we had a lot more newness, and we really hit, I think, a better sweet spot with our customer with the product selection.", "So the center courts certainly helped us. In addition to that, some of the resets that I mentioned earlier, I think, paid off for us both in pet food and in feed, and a couple other categories as well. And we had a little bit of a carry through in some of our live goods as well, Chuck. As you look to desensitize your business in Q4, which is always a challenge, because we want to grow that seasonal business, because our customers need it when the weather does hit, some of the offsets to that are in our core basics. And I think that's one of the reasons we put so much effort into some of the resets into some of the non-seasonal businesses, such as the consumables.", "And so with the launch of several product lines in pet as well as in feed, we think that that will continue to drive traffic should the weather not necessarily come. In the center court, I mentioned earlier that we are really going to feed off the momentum of the decor selection and a lot of the holiday sets. And the early read on that is very positive, along with the new collection that we'll be launching from Trisha Yearwood. So I think that there's a lot of things outside of weather that we've done. Now, will they offset that completely if it stays warm the entire back half? I can't necessarily say that, but I can tell you I think we've put our best foot forward.", "Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "All right.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Your line is open.", "Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.", "Hi, thanks. Good evening. I wanted to ask \u2013 the 1.5% increase in the comp transaction value is notable. It's a nice uplift and certainly an uptick relative to what you've seen in the last five quarters or so. Kurt, of the 120 basis point benefit to comps that you called out from the hurricane, how much of that benefited ticket versus transaction count? And then if you could also eliminate the margin impact, the gross margin impact from the hurricane, that'd be helpful.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Ben, this is Kurt. On the ticket side, I'd say we said about 1.5% comp ticket increase for the third quarter, and roughly about a third of that was related to the big ticket and the hurricanes. The rest of it was principally more broad, just overall product mix. So from the ticket side, I'd say that's really about 50 basis points, and you can basically deduct that as part of the 120 basis point overall.", "And then on the gross margin side, when it comes to rate, we basically saw that the hurricanes drove top line, did not really have a significant impact on the rate. We had generators at a lower average rate price, but you had other higher-ticket items on the truck tool or hardware side. And then you did have some higher transportation costs to get the product to the consumer, and get it there quickly. There certainly were some higher transportation costs. You probably also read and heard that generally, starting in about late August, September, the demand for transportation through those hurricanes put a significant demand on the transportation system, and costs went up. So we look at it on the gross margin side as about a net neutral on rate.", "Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.", "That's great clarity, thanks.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Hey, thanks, guys. Good quarter. You had been talking a bit, in the prepared remarks, about labor investment. Sounds like there's two dynamics with your adding hours, but there's also some wage pressure. Could you give a little more detail on those? I guess the \u2013 maybe first off is the labor investment beginning to drive any sales benefit that you can see? And then the wage pressure sounds like a new comment. I don't recall hearing that. Can you give a little more color on what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint, how long that pressure might last?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, sure, Peter. Good questions. First, I'd tell you that, as Greg mentioned, with additional hours, where it's meeting the customer's needs, and as our customer comes into the store, and is looking for that expert advice and service, as well as the customer solution center, we've invested additional payroll hours. We believe that's all part of the top-line growth.", "Our stores speak and talk often, as you've heard us talk about G.U.R.A. And we want to make sure that our G.U.R.A. and our customer service is at the top level currently today in the retail environment. So, that is having an impact. We believe it's all part of our initiative and what's driving the top line.", "When it comes to the wage pressure, I would just say that what we've seen in pockets, certain states, as you're aware, have instituted some regulations that have had an impact to us. And then in pockets both in the stores and distribution center side, where there's some competitive wage pressures, it is important for us to maintain \u2013 hire and maintain the best team members, and we've certainly made sure that that is top priority. And that is putting some level \u2013 moderate level of impact in the third and fourth quarter, and we believe we'll see some of that in 2018. Not saying that this is a level of significant it could have a 10 or 20 basis point impact in 2018 on the wage side.", "Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Okay. Thanks that's helpful. Good luck on the fourth quarter, guys.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Justin E. Kleber - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, good evening, guys. This is actually Justin Kleber on for Pete. Thanks for taking the question. If I look at the comp acceleration rolled into 2Q and adjust out for the hurricanes life, I'm still trying to understand if the improvement that you've seen was primarily driven by seasonal and big ticket or did you actually see sales within that core livestock and pet category also accelerate relative to what you experienced in the first half?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yes, this is Steve, and what I would tell you is, is that it was fairly broad-based, as Greg mentioned in his comments. While the pet and animal side probably was consistent with what we've traditionally seen. The other three walls of the box performed at pretty good levels. So, the traffic that was brought through, it seemed to translate within all four corners, and within most of the product mix. That's how I'd respond to that.", "Justin E. Kleber - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then -", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Go ahead.", "Justin E. Kleber - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "No, I'm sorry, Greg, go ahead.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Well, I was going to just follow up to say that our business was very strong well before the hurricanes ever came in. So, we were enjoying a very strong third quarter of sales. The hurricanes added a little at the end, but you lose at the beginning, you kind of lose in the middle, and you maybe pick up a little along the way with \u2013 the hurricane effects are not something that you plan on year to year, but that did not drive the third quarter results. We had a very strong business well before the hurricanes ever came.", "Justin E. Kleber - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Yeah, it sounds like maybe the pet and livestock business also improved as well. And just my second question for either you, Greg, or Steve, just was hoping you could maybe discuss any broader thoughts or observations as it relates to pet food category. As to these channel exclusive brands we're seeing move into the FDN (01:03:55) channel. Do you see any cannibalization to your business, as those brands become more broadly distributed? And maybe how does that influence just your thinking on private label with the core health brand? Thank you.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Great question. I mean, that seems to be a big topic, certainly in the pet circles right now, with everything that is taking place out there. I will tell you that for the last, I don't know, five, six, seven years, we've worked really hard to develop our own exclusive brands, and also get behind those brands that have a little bit more channel exclusivity to them. And while there may be a few folks go into mass and doing some things online, the strength of our business continues to be very strong in those brands that we identify with, that our customers identify with, that are much more channel specific.", "Our private brands, if I were to give you a sense for the quarter, and even for the year, are outstripping on a comp basis what the national brands are doing within our box. Our team members have gotten behind those. We've added several subcategories of those in 4health as well. We'll continue to do an extension of our assortment within the retriever line. And then, as I mentioned earlier, the UNTAMED launch, which is more of an LID-type (01:05:22) product, I think, is going to do incredibly well. And the early read on that is very strong. So, when we look long term at that business, we still see upside. We're staying very close to what's happening in the marketplace, but we have accelerated our own efforts to continue to move faster into the exclusive brand side.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.", "Joseph Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group", "Hi, guys. Good afternoon, or good evening, I should say. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick things. One was when you guys look at the e-commerce sales that you're having, are you seeing it \u2013 like more penetration from existing customers? Are you actually seeing new customers come into the fold, or like is it \u2013 newer ZIP codes that you hadn't seen before? Anything you can share on that?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Joe, this is Steve. I would tell you that it's a broad base of our customers that are coming to us. Whether it be Buy Online Pick Up in Store, I can give you examples of new customers who have found us through the web. At the same time, as Greg mentioned earlier, the majority of our customers are coming into our stores to pick up the product. Store locator is one of the key metrics for us, and we're finding that the store locator is up significantly in terms of percentage year-over-year, where customers are going online and then trying to find out where their nearest Tractor Supply Company store is.", "And then relative to customers that would like to have products shipped to them, again, that's only about 25% of our total sales. And what we're finding is is that it's a broad range of categories and most of those products are within the ZIP Codes that we have stores. And I think it's more of a convenience for them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Robert Iannarone - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey. Good evening, guys. And thanks for squeezing us in. This Rob Iannarone on for Scot Ciccarelli. So I wanted to follow up on some of the expense issues that you talked about earlier. So, you outlined expense pressures for the DC next year and higher incentive compensation costs potentially, but you also did talk about higher wages and freight and transportation costs. Can you help us get a better sense for the magnitude of those incremental cost pressures?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Yeah, Rob. This is Kurt. The best I can tell you at this point is we're going through our budgeting timeframe right now. The items that I mentioned, such as the new distribution center investment and the additional depreciation related to the investments, those are the more significant items. And so I would tell you they're listed in order of magnitude being depreciation and a new distribution center, to a lesser extent payroll and wage pressures is probably the best I can tell you at this point. Still a lot to be calculated and forecasted for 2018.", "Incentive comp, as I mentioned, I gave you the magnitude of that. It all depends on performance in 2018 and could have a magnitude of $0.06 to $0.08 next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Hi, good evening. Thanks for squeezing me in as well. Nice quarter. So, I apologize because I was on and off the call. But I just want to understand better, you did a 6.6% comp in Q3. That's a very nice number. If I'm hearing you correctly the hurricanes were not a big driver of that. So it was more reflective of the actual underlying business. And then if you look at the guidance, what's implied in the fourth quarter does assume a deceleration in comps. Is that a function of what we've seen so far, is the weather and extrapolating that, more difficult comparisons basically? So how should we think about the comps going from Q3 to Q4?", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Brian, this is Greg. That's us being our typical \u2013 let's say we're being conservative and knowing that what we've put out there we believe we can achieve. Given a little bit of weather favorability, those numbers could change. But we were being more conservative. We did with the guidance change indicate between 1% and 2%, so it's not a low or high range. It's just somewhat of a conservative average is what we're targeting for the fourth quarter. We've got an immense December we're up against. And we took that into consideration with that forecast.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from John Lawrence with Coker & Palmer. Your line is open.", "John R. Lawrence - Coker & Palmer, Inc.", "Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Afternoon, John.", "John R. Lawrence - Coker & Palmer, Inc.", "Yeah, would you just comment a little bit, Steve, we've always talked about this new product development cycle. Is there anything different that you're getting some of this product to market sooner, the process is faster, you've got better data on a regional basis, and I assume the success of that product just continues to sell through at a better rate than it was two years or three years ago?", "Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co.", "John, I love it when you ask the question because those are the kind of questions I'm prepared for. So thank you for the predictability. What I can tell you is new products are critically important to our engine, certainly our sales engine. And we talk about filling often, early and cheaply, and I would tell you that the merchant team's gone out and there's a lot of tests that we're conducting right now.", "There is a lot of newness in the store and I think a lot of that has to do with a couple things. One, there's maturity in our sourcing side of our business. We're starting to finally get our legs under us after a few years of new folks coming in, learning the processes, learning the culture, learning our partnerships that we have overseas and domestically. In terms of the planning department, they've done a nice job as they've continued to mature in identifying local opportunities and assortment planning opportunities for the merchants and bringing them back. And I think that we're better assorted today than we have been in the past.", "And we've also gone out and we've hired a number of new merchants on the buying team that have brought with us a wealth of experience from retailers that do things differently and maybe have an expertise in certain areas. So across the board, I feel pretty good about the movement and the traction that we're getting there. I don't want to say that that's the season for Q3's strength of business. I think it was much more broad-based than that for a variety of things. But I am encouraged as we move forward into Q4 and into 2018 that we've got a good grounding for where we're going to be headed.", "Operator", "And we will take our final question from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. I'll try to make this quick. I just had, really, two parts both related to margin. I think the first one, as I think about the 4Q gross margin decline, could you just walk us through like the biggest components of that? I think you mentioned freight being one of them, but I'm sort of curious, because as it looks like the compare is a bit easier, but if you'd just remind us what you're up against.", "And secondly, you reiterated a 10% op margin target longer term in the context of IT maybe being a bit of a drag, online and C.U.E. maybe being a bit of a drag. Just trying to look and understand really the offsets there. When you think out a few years, how do you get back there?", "Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co.", "Okay. Yeah, Stephen, in regards to Q4, we continue to see benefit and expect and anticipate from our gross margin initiatives pricing, strategic sourcing. We see some opportunity at the product margin rate in gross margin. Our anticipation is that would be offset by the headwinds we've seen on the transportation side, so it's really simply when it comes to compare, we think we can drive some improvement in the direct product margin, but that is going to be offset by higher costs on the transportation side.", "And then in regards to the long-term operating margin, I guess the best we could say is that we anticipate next year for the few items we mentioned and the investments in our long-term initiatives to have an increase in SG&A for those items. But most of those are either one time or they're temporary investments. And what I would tell you is that we see from there we're able to build as we are able to impact the top line and be able to maintain and improve the level of expense leverage from there. So looking out beyond 2018, it's too difficult to get specific, but there's a lot of what you see in the 2018 investments similar to 2017 that are very specific to the current or temporary investments in the business.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And that is all the time that we have for questions. I will now turn the call over to Greg Sandfort for additional or closing remarks.", "Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co.", "All right. Before I wrap up the call, I'd like to inform all of you that Christine Skold, this is her last earnings call. She's decided to leave Tractor Supply Company after a lot of thought and reflection. She shared this decision with her internal team a few weeks ago, and she felt it was time for her to find a new opportunity to further her professional growth.", "She will be actively engaged in the IR function through next Friday November 3. I'd like to thank Christine for her 15 years of dedicated service here at Tractor Supply. Through her work in a variety of roles, she has made a significant contribution to Tractor Supply, and we wish her all the best for continued success in her professional and personal pursuits.", "In closing, thank you for your continued support of our company. And we're focused on the end game.

I'll start today's call by providing a review of the operational and financial highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017, then review our strategic priorities going forward. Kurt will provide additional detail regarding our financial results and review our guidance for fiscal 2018. Following that, we will open the call for questions.", "We are pleased with our fourth quarter results and the continued progress of our ONETractor strategic initiatives to drive long-term sales growth, a more personalized customer experience, increased market share in all channels, and improved profitability over time.", "Our fourth quarter comparable store sales increased 4%, was driven by broad-based strength across all of our geographic regions and merchandise categories as well as increases in both comparable store transactions and average ticket.", "We know our customers look to Tractor Supply for their everyday basic needs and living their lifestyle. We believe the continued convergence of our physical and digital storefronts and updates to our in-store and online shopping experience are resonating with our customers. I want to thank our Tractor Supply team members across the country for a strong quarter and a solid year.", "Throughout the year, the team reacted to changing market conditions to optimize our performance, while we continued to invest in key initiatives that will drive longer term growth. The balance between daily execution and investing for the future is critical to the long-term success of any retailer, and our team did an excellent job of this in 2017.", "Now, let me touch on a few financial highlights for the fourth quarter and full year. Comparable store sales increased a strong 4% in the quarter and 2.7% for the year, with both transaction count on average ticket increasing in the quarter and full year. Net sales reached a record $7.26 billion for the year as we continued our strategy to open new stores to gain market share.", "The fourth quarter diluted EPS was $0.87, and adjusted EPS was $0.91. For the full year, diluted EPS was $3.30, with adjusted EPS of $3.33. We generated cash from the operations of $631 million, while returning $503 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends for the year. And this was the seventh consecutive year that we increased our quarterly cash dividend for shareholders.", "Now, in terms of operational highlights for 2017. We opened 101 new Tractor Supply stores and 25 Petsense locations, increasing our selling square footage by approximately 6%. We broke ground on a new distribution center in Frankfort, New York to support our expansion in the Northeast corridor of the country. We saw solid progress with many of our ONETractor initiatives.", "We rolled out Neighbor's Club, our loyalty program, across all channels. We significantly expanded our Buy Online Pickup in Store capabilities, we began testing our Stockyard and mobile PoS technologies, and we invested in store labor hours to ensure we would deliver on our commitment to legendary customer service. The end result was improved sales trends throughout the year and the highest customer satisfaction scores we have seen in the past 10 years.", "There's no question these two metrics are correlated and everything we do at Tractor Supply is with our customer in mind. We know there is a large customer base who need our products every day.", "We believe that we are uniquely positioned to serve this customer base better than anyone in the market and we see significant opportunities to broaden our customer base and increase our market share as our store base and online presence expands.", "Looking forward, ONETractor, which we began talking about at our Investment Community Day last year, is our ongoing strategy to leverage our unique positioning with our customers and to drive sustainable growth. We are accomplishing -- what we're accomplishing is more than just growing our e-commerce business.", "We are providing a convenient seamless shopping experience for our customers. ONETractor is a broad-based strategy to align the entire organization on how to better serve our customers while improving our supply chain to maximize both our near term and long-term results. This strategy is grounded in our foundational strengths of operational efficiency and a culture of team member engagement that ranks among the top in retail.", "Our ONETractor strategy initiatives are clearly aligned around four key objectives: driving profitable growth; building customer-centric engagement; offering the most relevant products and services; and enhancing our core and foundational infrastructure capabilities.", "As always, we will continue to take a balanced approach for managing the business and keeping the long-term focus in mind. Given the progress we have made and the positive results we are experiencing for many of our ONETractor initiatives, we are excited about our future investment opportunities.", "In 2018, our capital spending is prioritized to new stores, with an increase of capital dedicated to our store-level initiatives and our supply chain. We believe this is the right focus for the business this coming year.", "In 2018, we plan to open approximately 80 Tractor Supply stores. Our pipeline for 2018 for new store openings is robust and we are in the process of working on site selection for 2019 and 2020.", "And our recent data continues to support the potential for upwards of 25,000 Tractor Supply locations over time, and we will continue to be pleased -- and we are continued to be pleased with the new store productivity and their returns.", "Now, for 2018, we anticipate to open approximately 20 new Petsense stores, and we continue to believe that the Petsense format provides us with a unique opportunity to grow our Pet business by targeting a different customer with a differentiated preference for products and services not available today in a Tractor Supply store.", "2017 was a year of progress and learnings with Petsense and 2018 will be a year of system and process integration as we apply best practices from Tractor Supply to Petsense.", "In 2018, we anticipate the initial roll out phase of our new point-of-sale system across the Tractor Supply chain that will integrate with our mobile PoS. The new PoS will allow us to improve the customer experience at checkout, integrate our e-commerce order management system and leverage customer data to ensure a seamless shopping experience across all channels.", "We will continue to roll out Stockyard, which allows our team members and customers to leverage our digital assets and extend online assortments while they're in the store. This is particularly helpful when a customer is looking for a unique or hard to find item that may be make or model-specific. And also in 2018, we will be enhancing our online capabilities, including testing subscription services for recurring purchases of key products.", "Our Neighbor's Club loyalty program is a great example of how we are moving fast to better serve our customers while targeting personalized communication to them. Since our national roll out in April of 2017, we have quadrupled our enrollment to about 7 million members now.", "With Neighbor's Club, we now have a 360-degree view of our customers' buying behaviors. This is a tremendous tool that should allow us to offer more relevant services and products to our customers as we leverage the data we have collected.", "And in regards to our supply chain, our largest initiatives in 2018 are the completion of our New York distribution facility, the addition of two additional mixing centers, and an East Coast import center that will help the flow of our direct imports.", "In total, we plan to invest approximately $80 million in these projects, with the majority of the spend falling in 2018. While this will increase our capital spending budget this year, the build out of our distribution network will improve our delivery to stores and enhance our speed of delivery for direct to customer purchases.", "Our team made great progress in 2017 and we are building a solid foundation for future growth. We will continue to invest in the business across our ONETractor strategy, while moving fast but deliberately to capture efficiencies that will in turn drive profitable growth.", "I'll now turn the call over to Kurt to review our financial results for the quarter and the year. ", "Kurt Barton", "Thank you, Greg and good afternoon everyone. While Greg has taken you through the highlights of 2017, let me provide you with some additional financial details and review our initial outlook for 2018. As a reminder, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017, Petsense sales are now included in our comparable store sales performance.", "For the fourth quarter of 2017, we had strong comp store sales growth of 4%, with comp transaction count increasing 2.7% versus an increase of 4% in last year's fourth quarter. Comps were positive across all geographic regions and all major product categories.", "All months had positive comp sales performance, with November being the strongest month of the quarter. Sales were positively impacted as cold temperatures arrived across our markets and our customers responded favorably to our assortment.", "Petsense comp store sales were essentially in line with the chain average. Comp sales average ticket increased 1.3% compared to prior year's reported 90 basis point decrease. The increase was primarily driven by the mix of goods. For the first time in 17 quarters, deflation was essentially neutral and was not a meaningful drag on comps.", "For the fourth quarter, gross margin increased 50 basis points to 34.2%. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to less promotional activity and improved sell-through rates on seasonal products during the quarter. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in transportation cost, driven by higher carrier rates, and diesel fuel cost, coupled with a higher mix of freight-intensive products.", "Including depreciation and amortization, SG&A as a percentage of sales increased by 120 basis points to 24.8% from 23.6% in the prior year's quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to deleverage of occupancy and other fixed cost resulting from the 53rd week of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 that did not reoccur this year, and higher store payroll from our continued commitment to customer service.", "Also impacting SG&A in the fourth quarter were higher store level incentive compensation, resulting from the strong comparable store sales increase and incremental investments in infrastructure and technology related to our ONETractor initiatives.", "Our effective tax rate was 38.9% in the fourth quarter, which was higher due to a one-time non-cash write-down of our net deferred tax assets of approximately $4.9 million or $0.04 per diluted share as a result of our lower effective tax rate going forward.", "Our balance sheet is strong and our working capital is in good shape. For the fourth quarter, our comp store inventory at Tractor Supply stores was essentially flat year-over-year. Exiting the year, we believe our inventory is well-positioned, given the sales strength we had in the fourth quarter of 2017.", "In 2017, we generated cash from operations of $631 million. Total capital expenditures were $250 million with approximately 40% of this being maintenance-related and the remaining 60% being growth-oriented in areas such as new stores, digital capability investments, and supply chain infrastructure capability.", "For the quarter, we repurchased about 694,000 shares of our common stock for $42.8 million. We repurchased over $369 million or about 5.9 million shares of our common stock in fiscal 2017.", "Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2007, we have repurchased $2.1 billion of our common stock. Our remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $870 million as of year-end.", "Turning now to guidance for 2018. We expect net sales to range -- in a range of $7.69 billion to $7.77 billion, an increase of 6% to 7%. Comp store sales growth is anticipated to be in the range of 2% to 3%.", "As Greg mentioned earlier, we anticipate opening about 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 20 new Petsense locations. Our plans call for approximately half of our new stores to open in the first half of the year.", "Turning now to cost. As has been well publicized, the retail industry is facing cost pressures on rising freight rates due to a shortage of drivers and higher diesel fuel prices along with inflationary wage pressures across retail locations and the supply chain.", "As I shared with you last quarter, we are not immune to these increases. The team is working to balance our initiatives and the investments we are making in our stores and at the distribution centers with strict cost disciplines and underlying operational efficiencies.", "All-in, between our investments to grow the business and the external headwinds, we anticipate some pressure in 2018 on our operating margin. The largest items include: first, anticipated higher freight cost driven by rising transportation rates and the higher diesel fuel cost; wage investments for our team members at our stores and distribution centers; as well, preopening expenses and incremental operating expenses for the ramp-up of our new distribution center in Upstate New York. We are forecasting the distribution center cost to impact the second half of 2018, predominantly in the fourth quarter. Our expectation is that gross margin would be flat to down slightly with the bulk of the pressure on SG&A.", "Given the combination of investments we are making in the business and cost headwinds, operating margin, at the midpoint of our guidance range, is assumed to be about 8.8%. Our outlook includes about 20 basis points of incremental investments to accelerate our priorities as we balance the allocation of benefits from tax reform.", "More than ever, we are aggressively reviewing our cost structure as we look to strengthen our competitive advantages to better serve our customers. We are committed to ensuring our spending is directed to our highest strategic priorities, all on a sustainable basis.", "Net income is forecasted in the range of $490 million to $515 million or $3.95 to $4.15 per diluted share. We would anticipate stronger comp store sales and earnings performance in the first half of the year as compared to the second half.", "Given the comparisons for 2017, our comp sales in the first half of the year are forecasted to be at or above our guidance range for the year, with the second half of the year below the range.", "For the first quarter of 2018, we will have one extra comp day as we were open on New Year's Day for the first time. We estimate this extra day will contribute about 60 to 70 basis points to comparable store sales in the first quarter and about 10 to 15 basis points for the full year. We would also anticipate that the first quarter of 2018 will have the highest comp and the lowest level of operating profit margin compression of the year.", "Moving to below the line. Our effective tax rate is anticipated to be positively impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017. The Tax Act is expected to reduce our effective tax rate from approximately 36.7% to a range of 23% to 23.5% in 2018.", "As I mentioned, a portion of the benefits will be allocated to accelerating investments in labor wages at our stores and in our distribution centers, and the support of our ONETractor initiatives.", "We're also modestly increasing our capital spending to a range of $260 million to $300 million with about 75% of the spending going towards initiatives to support long-term growth.", "Interest expense is forecasted to be approximately $17 million to $20 million. Depreciation expense is estimated to increase 9% to 10%. For the year, our share repurchases are anticipated to be towards the high end of our target to reduce our weighted average shares outstanding by 2.5% to 3.5%. For modeling purposes, we have assumed weighted average shares outstanding of about 124 million shares in 2018.", "We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in the business to support long-term growth through the opening of new stores and our ONETractor initiatives. We also are committed to creating lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and consistent share repurchases.", "That concludes my prepared remarks and I will now turn the call back to Greg.", "Gregory Sandfort", "Thank you, Kurt. As we mark our 80th anniversary as a company, we are proud of our history and strong heritage of embracing change and leveraging technology to capture growth opportunities.", "I want to thank the more than 26,000 members of the Tractor Supply family who bring our mission and values to life everyday as they serve our customers. Our passion and commitment to provide legendary service and great products at everyday low prices will continue to be the foundation of our growth.", "With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions.", "Mary Winn Pilkington", "Okay. Now, we will take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]", "And we'll take our next question from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.", "Steven Forbes", "Good afternoon. Maybe if you could start, I think I heard you right, but can you provide some additional context around the implied margin guidance for next year at the midpoint, right?", "As we digested last quarter, right, the margin headwinds you laid out, I believe you mentioned 20 basis points of incremental pressure as you balance the benefit of tax reform. Is that, right? And then can you just help us understand where those dollars are being spent as you try to accelerate some of the opportunities you see?", "Kurt Barton", "Sure Steve and this is Kurt. I'll first just confirm what you said. Yes, we indicated that about 20 basis points is investment from tax reform that's impacting the operating margin. But if I step back to the Q3 call, we indicated as to what we saw in regards to our investments and cost pressures, we anticipated operating margin decline in 2018.", "If you try to bridge that to the guidance that we have, we've -- we'd have about 50% of that operating margin implied deleveraged in 2018 specific to investments in the business.", "And I would tell you that with investments from the business that we have related to tax reform, as we see that opportunity to invest those resources into labor wages at the stores and distribution centers, as well as ONETractor initiatives, the additional implied into our guidance has more visibility to areas like transportation cost that I would say that even in the last few months, it's been widely publicized, indicated about the transportation industry that we're seeing greater headwinds into that area.", "So, the difference in our outlook today as to what was indicated at Q3, principally due to the investments that we're making in the business and stronger cost pressures specific to the transportation industry.", "Steven Forbes", "Thank you for that. And then maybe just a quick follow up on supply chain, right. So maybe just a higher level, help us conceptualize how you view the capabilities in the network post New York. You mentioned a few other additions that are hitting this year. But do you envision having to add direct fulfillment points to the network or additional capabilities? I mean, where do you see the evolution of the network kind of going over the next couple of years here?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes, Steve, this is Steve Barbarick. I would tell you, at this point, once we get that New York distribution center up, we've already got an expansion going on at Waverly, so I feel really good about that.", "We do have some mixing centers that we believe can continue to add value as we're bringing speed in both products to there. We're using 3PL in trying to get a better sense for that. But all of this will be baked into our CapEx guidance as we move forward. So as we move forward, you'll see that in the numbers.", "Steven Forbes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Peter Benedict with Baird.", "Peter Benedict", "Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. First question, just around -- you mentioned kind of store-level initiatives. I may have heard talk about the PoS, maybe talk a little bit more about what that -- the cost pressures, I guess, around rolling out the PoS?", "And then, are there other store initiatives? I'm thinking lay out changes, things like that, merchandising, that you're testing, Steve, that you think could have an impact, if not this year, maybe in 2019?", "Kurt Barton", "Yes. And Peter, this is Kurt. I'll start with the first question on your question related to point-of-sale. And we're indicating that -- we're making investments in our point-of-sale system. That will be capital that we're investing this year. So, it has some impact in depreciation in 2017. It's not a significant part of that depreciation as we roll that capital out throughout the year, but that's where most of the cost. No other real operating cost impacts specific to a new investment of point-of-sale.", "Steve Barbarick", "And Peter I would -- I think the question -- the way I'll respond is less about the expense side, more about the sales and opportunity side. So, we have really laid out reset program that we're working toward for the spring and into the summer of this next year that I'm very excited about. You'll see a lot of newness within the center courts and up and down the aisles.", "The only other one that I would mention, and I think we've hinted to this in the past is that we do have a couple of concept stores that we're working on right now. They're up and running. The layouts are a little bit different. They're still within the same size box, similar prototype.", "So, if we find that they're working well, then what we'll be able to do is retrofit them back into the existing stores should we opt to. It also gives us an opportunity to put this new format into existing stores as we move forward.", "Essentially, that layout is -- we reduced the number of SKUs that we felt we could accommodate through our fulfillment channels in e-commerce. And then giving more space to categories that we believe we have an opportunity to continue to grow share in, so the bigger bulkier products within the inside of the store. We've got a number of pallet drops that we've opened up for our operations team to better manage the labor model.", "And I would say, the early read on those two stores has been very positive from both the field as well as from our customers. So, I would anticipate, in the future, you'll see more of that concept in a lot of the new stores. And then we'll be looking at retrofitting some existing stores to see what the customer's feedback is on that.", "Peter Benedict", "That's fair. That's helpful. I guess my follow-up, looking in terms of the online business, I may have missed it, but did you guys give the percentage of sales that were online for the year? And then as you look out over 2018 and 2019, maybe talk about how you view your pricing online, what type of tools you may have to help optimize that as we go forward? Thank you.", "Steve Barbarick", "Sure. So, in Q4, that's usually a heavier time of the year for us on the e-com side and our percent of sales was probably between 2.5% and 3%. That's what it was. For the full year, it was between 1.5% and 2%.", "So, as we look forward, we continue to see that as a growth mechanism for us. And it's in two ways. It's Buy Online Pickup in Store as well as some of the ship to home product. The vast majority of what we do today is picked up in store, so whether it be shipped to store or picked up in store, our customers still like to come and engage with us in the four walls, but a few would like the convenience of having it shipped to them.", "As you look forward, we've done a really nice job, the team has, going out and doing price surveys, looking at where a lot of the major brands are positioned. And I feel that we're very competitive today.", "And as we move forward with ONETractor, one of the capabilities we're adding is a more robust price intelligence tool. And we believe that will give us greater value in the future as well. So, a number of things that play here, but all very positive as we move forward with our ONETractor strategy.", "Peter Benedict", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.", "Seth Sigman", "Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. A couple of follow-up questions here. I guess, just first on the investments and the margin outlook. I'm just wondering, have you guys built in any positive offsets within the guidance?", "And then, in general, if you think about the potential for sales to maybe come in better, would that flow through or would you offset that with more spending, just given the demands and the higher investment requirements that you're basically talking about? Thanks.", "Kurt Barton", "Yes, this is Kurt. You know what, when we built our outlook for 2018, we took a pretty rigorous look at all of the cost and all the spend. And I would tell you that in an investment like this, we certainly have an opportunity and there are some benefits that we've got that are offsets to these investments that are baked into that outlook.", "As we're growing the topline and with comp positives in there, there are areas in the overhead store support center cost, the store and distribution center occupancy cost, some of the investments we've made in there as well as leverage, we're seeing the benefits. So, we take it -- we're taking a pretty rigorous look at and we are managing tightly, and there are definitely some benefits that play into the outlook to help offset some of those investments. And then the second question--", "Seth Sigman", "Okay. The second part of that was just to the extent that sales do come in better, I realize some of the investments are within your control, some are not. But would better sales flow through? Or do you think that you would accelerate spending further just given the investment requirements in the business?", "Kurt Barton", "Yes. Seth, I would say that we've got a pretty good aggressive investment plan, I think, as you've seen. And so as those investments start to take hold, and as we believe they will begin to drive the sales, our plan, our strategy is we'll invest to what our capacity and capability is. And I think we've got a realistic capacity in there. And so you'd see some benefits dropping to the bottom line.", "Seth Sigman", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Elizabeth Suzuki", "Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question.", "Gregory Sandfort", "Hey Liz.", "Elizabeth Suzuki", "Hey. On your planned store opening pace, slowing a little bit from about 6.6% in 2017 to about 5% in 2018. First question is, are there still a few stores left to close? And then second is why slow the pace of store growth if you're going to have some extra cash post tax reform? I mean, obviously, you're making some investments in ONETractor that are going to be pretty significant. But is there also maybe a strain on management resources in terms of finding the right people to run new stores?", "Gregory Sandfort", "Liz hi, this is Greg. No, there's no limit on how many stores actually we could open from the standpoint of management in the ranks ready. The reason we slowed to 80, if you want to call it that, I say there's a redirection of our capital investments. We've had some tremendous success with some of these ONETractor initiatives. It's a bit of a reallocation of capital in the short term to accelerate those and continue to keep the store opening schedule robust. We don't have any one that's chasing us for these sites.", "And we're going through with some new data that's demonstrating again to us that there are at least 25,000, as a number, of Tractor sites out there. Now we know that Tractor stores are a great value to the consumer, and they also help us from a standpoint of profitability as a company. But we really are just reallocating some of those dollars to accelerate some of the things in ONETractor that right now are showing us great promise.", "Elizabeth Suzuki", "All right, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Horvers", "Thanks. Good evening guys.", "Gregory Sandfort", "Good evening.", "Christopher Horvers", "So my first question is can you talk about the performance of the oil and gas markets? They were a drag as oil prices dropped, and then they're a bit more and more neutral, I think, over the past couple of quarters. How has the performance of those stores changed in the fourth quarter relative to, say, the second and the third?", "Kurt Barton", "Yes, Chris, this is Kurt. I would tell you that as we've seen it and said that the Texas, Oklahoma oil market and other energy areas have those headwinds have subsided. And the last couple of quarters, prior to Q4, they -- we said that we saw those areas falling in within chain average.", "And I would tell you, we're pleased in the fourth quarter in those particular areas to see some good strong performance in their -- in line with chain average. And so as you're seeing indicators of that area, I would say that we're pleased to see that no longer really being a headwind for us.", "Christopher Horvers", "Understood. And then also there's a bit of an earlier Easter this year, I think it's April 1st, so it flows right, I guess, at the start of your second quarter. Historically, has an earlier Eastern helps you? And is it sort of -- is it 50 basis points, is it 25, is it 75? Any quantification will be very helpful. Thanks very much.", "Kurt Barton", "Sure, it's a good question. I would say that it's not about an early Easter helping or hurting. I think it's a good point to bring up in that the timing of Easter between the halves where it plays into. So, this year, we've got Easter on the Sunday right after the end of Q1. So, the holiday weekend, that Friday and Saturday will be in Q1 and so that can shift a little bit between Q1 and Q2.", "When weather breaks in March has probably more to do about the impact than that weekend. But I would say that as you look at that, we anticipate that, that weekend falling into Q1 can have some impact, but not a material.", "Christopher Horvers", "Okay. Thanks very much. Have a great quarter.", "Gregory Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mike Lasser with UBS.", "Michael Lasser", "Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My question is on the outlook for comp over the next few quarters. So, it sounds like inflation has become some of an issue, the oil and gas markets have stabilized. You're providing an optimistic outlook for the next couple of quarters where you said that you expect your comps to be above 3% or near that range, and yet your -- in the second half of the year and middle of the year, comparisons become harder.", "But you're also talking about sub 2% comp when all of these factors should going to be a benefit and you'll experience a return on the investments that you've been making. So, why would you only be expecting less than a 2% comp in that sort of scenario?", "Kurt Barton", "Sure Michael, this is Kurt. In regards to our outlook, as we looked at the year and I'd say the most significant factor in there is the strength of the second half of 2017 and the comparisons over there. We had in Q3 two strong hurricanes that will be cycling as well as a good strong performance in fourth quarter with weather and other positive factors.", "So, we've got that compare to go up against. When we look at the year, we're taking a good realistic approach as to what we can actually drive in regards to traffic and sales and aren't making too many wide assumptions about what might happen in the second half there.", "We're going to drive our strategies that we believe will benefit both the first half and the second half. And our guidance is more about our ability to have good significant -- good consistent traffic, and it's more about the comparison in the second half of the year.", "Michael Lasser", "And my follow question is on the performance of the new stores in the fourth quarter, if we back out the contributions from the extra week, it looks like the new store productivity was in the high 50% range. Is that right? And is that what you expect new store productivity to be moving forward?", "Kurt Barton", "I would -- Mike, I would just say that, that percentages would not be consistent with new store productivity as it's calculated. And I understand the 53rd week makes this fourth quarter probably the hardest one to calculate for new store productivity.", "Here's what I'll tell you, is that we continue to be pleased with new store productivity. Fourth quarter had a good strong new store productivity and the -- consistent with the last few quarters in 2017, our new store productivity is consistent with 2015 in those years where we saw strength in new store productivity.", "We're pleased -- we look at our new stores and compare against -- measure against performance to the pro forma and the IR hurdle, and the 2017's have outperformed both of those. So, we're pleased with new store productivity.", "Michael Lasser", "Thank you very much. Good luck with the year.", "Gregory Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Incorporated.", "Benjamin Bienvenu", "Good evening. And thanks for taking my questions.", "Gregory Sandfort", "Hey Ben.", "Benjamin Bienvenu", "I wanted to ask about operating margins in a little bit different way. So, you said you expected the midpoint operating margins for this next year to be 8.8%. Is it your expectation that this is for the low watermark in the multiyear trajectory for operating margins longer term and you still think a 10% operating margin goal long-term is a realistic goal?", "Kurt Barton", "Yes, Ben, this is Kurt. And so I would tell you that if I -- I'd step back, talk a little bit about the business and what we see long-term, I would say the business is strong, the investments are clearly paying off for a lot of the things that Greg mentioned earlier.", "The investments are having some pressure and had in 2017 and are having pressure as we anticipate in 2018. But we're committed to those investments being made to drive long-term topline, and then the overall bottom-line, we believe that we're going to grow with those investments, EPS at a low double-digit range. And as we manage those investments and our cost, we can grow operating margin.", "And so as you look at 2018, we will be focused heavily on the cost and management of investments. But we believe we have the opportunity in the long term to continue to grow operating margin. ", "Benjamin Bienvenu", "Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, I wanted to shift as it relates to some of your investments and distribution network changes. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the impacts from the West Coast 3PL trans load center and what you think it could mean for your business as you put in place your East Coast import center in 2018?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes, this is Steve. What it's really helped us do is bring product in, house it and ship it out based on need. In the past, we were shipping container loads to our distribution centers, and it wasn't as effective as it needed to be because we're filling those containers and those DCs with more product than they actually needed.", "So, by having these transload centers, what we're able to do is take the over and aboves, pare them down and ship them to the stores that actually need the product. So, it should have a benefit in our seasonal inventories and make us more nimble as we move forward rather than having more clearance on the backside.", "The last thing I'd tell you is it also allows us to build pallets of product for our stores so that the operations of the business, when it gets to the store, can be more efficient. In the past, it would all come in and have to be sorted out. These transload centers now will allow us to go ahead and pull together a lot of the seasonal product and ship it in 1 pallet to the stores.", "Benjamin Bienvenu", "Great. Thanks for all that detail. And best of luck.", "Gregory Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Alan Rifkin with BTIG. ", "Alan Rifkin", "Certainly appreciate it that as a result of the tax legislation, you are making some reinvestments, particularly in the form of higher wages. But yet, if we look at your forecasted operating margin for 2018 of 8.8% at the midpoint, that's lower than where you were even five or six years ago.", "Is there -- at what point in time do you believe that all of these reinvestments, not only in wages, but other areas, at what point in time do you think that that will result in incrementally higher operating margins? And then I have a follow-up, please.", "Kurt Barton", "Sure Alan. It's a good question. As we've said, in the last few years we've been making investments and you're seeing some of those investments and the impact on the operating margin. And our long-term goal is to grow operating margin annually. We believe that's achievable.", "And as I mentioned previously, our investments that we've been making, we believe we're making them in the right area, they're driving the long-term growth potential. Those sales growth opportunities -- typically in our plan that they would lag the initial investments. And those investments, over the last few years, are generally starting to plateau.", "So, when we look at that, we see that the investments and with the top line benefit our ability then to grow operating margin. So, we're very focused on 2018 right now. I would tell you that as we see the long-term, we're committed to our ability to grow the bottom-line profits. And we believe with those investments, the strength of the top line, you'll see operating margins improving.", "Alan Rifkin", "Okay. Thank you. And a follow-up, if I may. If we look at CPI and PPI data and listen to what the Fed is forecasted to do in 2018, there's certainly greater signs of inflation. As part of your 2% to 3% comp guidance and regardless of what inflation or deflation may be at the product level, are you contemplating perhaps taking prices up to help offset some of these higher costs?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes, this is Steve. I would tell you, we're going to be opportunistic. I mean, we constantly do a scan of the marketplace and where we see potential and opportunity, we take advantage of that. So, that is certainly on the table, and we will adjust accordingly.", "But we also want to make sure that it's balanced with market share, like we've always told you all. And we're making sure that we're doing the right thing for the long term of the business. So, if that opportunity presents itself, I can pretty much guarantee, we will take advantage of it.", "Alan Rifkin", "Would you be a price leader or would you wait to see what competitors do?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes. I would tell you that there are markets we've got where we will certainly be price leaders, and there are markets that we're at where we'll be watching the market very closely. We are a test and learn company, we've got a price optimization tool that allows us to look at elasticity, and we will do just that.", "Alan Rifkin", "Okay. Thank you. best of luck in the New Year.", "Gregory Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.", "Paul Kearney", "Hi guys. This is Paul Kearney calling on for Scott. Thanks for taking my question.", "Gregory Sandfort", "Hey Paul.", "Paul Kearney", "Curious if you can maybe provide any detail on what you've learned from your core customers through the loyalty program?", "Steve Barbarick", "Sure, this is Steve. One of the things that we've certainly learned is that they have a keen interest in wanting to build a stronger relationship with us. The enrollment that we've had today has exceeded our expectation and continues to be do so. I would also tell you those folks that are core customers that are part of the program, there's a higher engagement in terms of click through rates, open rates, redemption of offers. And we recently did a study, and this is pretty interesting.", "These folks have a high -- have a much higher statistically significant difference and their likelihood to recommend us to others, to return and their overall satisfaction with Tractor Supply Company is higher. So, there's a lot here that we're learning, they're coming in more often and when they do, they spend more.", "So, as we move forward, our focus is on continued enrollment and in continued engagement through personalization to drive more loyalty. If there's one thing that, I guess, to me looking back is a surprise, I would tell you it's the amount of activity that our core customers are coming to us and how often they come to us to buy their needs and get what they need.", "So, it's a much higher frequency rate than we had originally anticipated. And so now we're able to segment those customers off and talk to them in a more personalized manner.", "Paul Kearney", "Great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. I guess, qualitatively, how does the management team kind of look at balancing between growth and improving ROIC, I guess, over the short-term and longer term? And how important is ROIC as you make these investments through the year? Thank you.", "Kurt Barton", "Paul, this is Kurt. We -- as Greg mentioned, we focus on both of those. We understand the importance of maintaining a good ROIC. The important thing for us as we look at it, maybe to share in regards to our perspective on it, is that we are making significant investments. These are key investments for the long term.", "And so during that time, as those investments may have -- take time to take hold on the topline, you're seeing some pressure on ROIC. But we do look at, with each investment, the return on investment and how we balance ROIC, it's part of our overall management. And I would tell you that we believe, with the investments we're making today, it not only drive the top line, but in the long term ROIC improvement.", "Paul Kearney", "All right. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Matt McClintock with Barclays.", "Matthew McClintock", "Hi guys. Good afternoon everyone and welcome Mary Winn. Just on wages, wanted to follow up on that. You guys seem to be ahead of the curve in addressing this topic last quarter, specifically. I just wanted to know, has there been any real change in how you think about wages relative to last quarter, now that tax reform has been passed?", "And kind of related to that, it will be nice to revisit since you're a high growth retailer, one of the few that are opening stores, how do you think about finding employees, not store managers, but employees, in what is increasingly a tight labor market? Thanks.", "Gregory Sandfort", "Hey Matt, this is Greg. Two things. One is changes from maybe a quarter to now. I think what we're seeing is we have a unique customer base. We have a unique team member that wants to work in Tractor Supply. Probably not the average person that would work in some of these other formats. They typically have a love for the lifestyle. They have a passion for living this lifestyle.", "So, we attract team members from those local communities because they enjoy the lifestyle, want to participate in it. And guess what? Working for Tractor Supply, they can get a discount on those things that they need. So, that's the first thing.", "We're not having a problem attracting those people. But some of the changes that we are seeing is there are some retail organizations that are making bold statements about we're going to have a minimum price guarantee to our team members of X, Y and Z. And here's how I look at that.", "And I've said this to our organization, I said we need to be priced very competitively, if not leading the market, in each of the markets where we have stores. We're in 49 states. Those 49 states are not equal. There's different challenges, there's different, I would call it, wage rates that need to be addressed. Some states are passing state laws that force some of that. Other states are not.", "So, we've taken a very proactive posture and said even in our 2018 planning, given some of the tax advantages that we have, we're going to stay not only very competitive on wages but, in many cases, we're going to be probably the person leading up in the wages because we need to make sure we've got the best people period.", "Matthew McClintock", "If I could have a follow-up. Just on Buy Online Pickup in Store, the vast majority of your sales flow through that channel. I was just wondering you launched that capability impressively just a little bit more than a year ago, and now it's more than half of your sales. Did that mix shift towards Buy Online Pickup in Store cannibalize your existing e-commerce business or was it largely additive to your existing e-commerce business before?", "Steve Barbarick", "Yes, this is Steve. No, it's been additive. As a matter of fact, we're seeing growth in both areas. So, comp store sales, so to speak, on the ship to side, continues to scale up.", "Matthew McClintock", "Perfect. Thanks a lot. Best of luck.", "Gregory Sandfort", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Fassler", "Thanks so much. Good afternoon guys. My first question relates to the investments that you've discussed. Is there a way to a portion how much of them relate to cyclical pressures, such as freight and shipping and labor as opposed to what you'd call strategic investments that don't relate at all to the cost backdrop?", "Kurt Barton", "Yes, Matt, this is Kurt. The easiest way I could tell you is about 50% of the additional cost increases that we pointed out, I would bucket as investments and the other 50% are really more the cost pressures. And the transportation piece of that is probably the biggest one of that, 50% of that's cost pressures and the majority, the rest is the investments.", "Matthew Fassler", "And should we think about that 50% that relates to investments basically being aligning with the piece of the tax windfall that you're reinvesting, is that the way to think about that relationship?", "Kurt Barton", "Yes, about -- so about a little over a third is, as I mentioned, it's probably 20 basis points of the operating margin comes from our tax investments. So, it's not all 50% of it, but it's probably more than a third of that is from our conscious investment on the things we mentioned with the opportunity of the additional resources to invest in a key strategic part of our business such as our team members. We're investing in those areas. That's probably the right quantification of that.", "Matthew Fassler", "Got you. And then separately, you mentioned in your remarks earlier that you're going to start to test subscription commerce. I'm wondering if the categories that would be most appropriate for subscriptions presumably largely in queue, align with the businesses where you currently have e-commerce penetration and what the shipping and logistic -- what the cost essentially -- logistics and shipping charges are cost -- associated with those categories will suggest for the return profile of that, if that were to take hold?", "Kurt Barton", "Well, it's a great question. And one of the things we've got to do is find out whether or not our customers even have an interest in subscription to Tractor Supply Company. So, this is going to be a slow roll. It's going to be a test and learn. We're going to start with a few categories, see what kind of interest there is.", "The great thing about the opportunity and the tool is we can geo-target. There's a variety of things that we can do here so it doesn't get out ahead of us. And so it's going to be managed. And as we continue to scale, if it works, we'll be able to communicate to you along the way what impact that it has.", "Matthew Fassler", "And Steve, would you say that Neighbor's -- the Neighbor's program, the data that you've obtained from it has indicated that your customers are purchasing with you the kind of consistency that will suggest a subscription would be a good fit?", "Steve Barbarick", "That's a really good question. I would tell you that I think there might be some interest. I think we owe it to our customers, quite frankly. When you look at retail today, you get involved with where the market is going to go. And I believe we owe it to our customers through our idea of anytime, anywhere and anyway that whole idea of being a convenience for them.", "But I think we need to do it based on scale, we need to do it based on our ability to make sure we execute and offer the right customer service along the way. And we need to do it in a way for our shareholders that we don't do it so that it's going to be overly costly. So, we will manage this appropriately. But we do believe we owe it to them to at least offer that capability.", "Matthew Fassler", "Thank you.", "Mary Winn Pilkington", "Noah, I think we've hit the top of the hour, so I think we'll wrap up now. I'm going to turn it back over to Greg for a wrap up. I know we're leaving some people in the queue, so I apologize about that. My number is 615-440-4212, and I look forward to speaking to anyone that's interested in calling. So, please give me a call, and I'll turn it back to Greg.", "Gregory Sandfort", "Well, thank you, everyone, for being on the call today. I'm excited that we're going to be hosting our upcoming Annual Sales Meeting for over 3,000 of our Tractor Supply team members here in February. And during that same time, we're going to be hosting our Investment Community Day, that's scheduled for February 20 here in Nashville, where we plan to further discuss our strategic growth drivers for the long term with all of you.", "If you have any questions, as Mary said, please reach out to her. She'll be happy to help you if you have any further questions. And again, thank you for dialing in today.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.
